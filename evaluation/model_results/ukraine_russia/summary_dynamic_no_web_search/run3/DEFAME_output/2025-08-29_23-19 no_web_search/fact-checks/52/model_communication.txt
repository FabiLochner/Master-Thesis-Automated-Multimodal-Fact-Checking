# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. While images with the E! News logo and USAID logo are circulating, the BBC Verify graphic indicates that the claim is false. Additionally, the Vanity Fair article discusses Elon Musk's retweet of the claim, but the article does not confirm the claim's veracity. The Gwara Media article also debunks the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025 destroyed numerous structures, including homes and mansions. However, the search results do not mention any Ukrainian military officials or their mansions being affected by the fires. The NPR article mentions the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but it does not link it to the destroyed structures.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "During the January 2025 wildfires, eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in Los Angeles, California."

## Actions
```
image_search("January 2025 wildfires Los Angeles")
image_search("Ukrainian military officials mansions burned Los Angeles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results contain images of wildfires in Los Angeles. One source mentions the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires and includes an image of the fires (<image:7262>). Reuters also published images of the wildfires (<image:7263>). Another source from Britannica.com shows a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires (<image:7264>).

The sources are: [Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/january-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-once-generation-events-now-happen-frequently), [Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-los-angeles-wildfires-rage-2025-01-08/3TQRCJ3GGFNF5I6YEQ3524YLTE/), and [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to wildfires in Los Angeles. One source from NPR contains images of structures destroyed by fire (<image:7268>). Another source from The New York Times, published on February 2, 2025, also includes an image of the damage caused by the Los Angeles wildfires (<image:7269>).

Additionally, a source from the Council on Foreign Relations contains an image of a neighborhood destroyed by fire (<image:7270>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that wildfires occurred in Los Angeles in January 2025. However, the search results do not mention any Ukrainian military officials or their mansions.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The information about the mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to the Los Angeles wildfires. NPR published an article with an image of houses that survived and were destroyed by the fire (<image:7276>). CBS42.com contains an image of mansions damaged by the wildfires (<image:7278>). PBS NewsHour reported that nearly 2,000 structures were destroyed, including homes (<image:7279>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine): 
Content: The NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, contains an image of structures destroyed by the Los Angeles wildfires (<image:7288>). The article also mentions the Russia-Ukraine conflict.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025 destroyed numerous structures, including homes and mansions. However, the search results do not mention any Ukrainian military officials or their mansions being affected by the fires. The NPR article mentions the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but it does not link it to the destroyed structures.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that NDTV did interview Tulsi Gabbard. The Halifax City News article, dated March 17, 2025, mentions Gabbard's comments about Trump and Putin.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Gabbard said Trump and Putin were "good friends." The Halifax City News article states that Gabbard said Trump is looking forward to success ahead of talks with Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In an interview with NDTV on March 17, 2025 Director of US National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were good friends."

## Actions
```
image_search("NDTV Tulsi Gabbard interview March 17 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
NDTV has an interview with Tulsi Gabbard (<image:6009>, <image:6015>). Halifax City News also features an image of Tulsi Gabbard (<image:6011>).

The sources are: [https://www.ndtv.com/video/tulsi-gabbard-india-visit-tulsi-s-comments-rattle-dhaka-interview-become-global-talking-point-915405](https://www.ndtv.com/video/tulsi-gabbard-india-visit-tulsi-s-comments-rattle-dhaka-interview-become-global-talking-point-915405), [https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/), and [https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/tulsi-gabbard-exclusive-idea-of-islamist-caliphate-will-be-defeated-us-ukraine-peace-talks-update](https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/tulsi-gabbard-exclusive-idea-of-islamist-caliphate-will-be-defeated-us-ukraine-peace-talks-update).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that NDTV did interview Tulsi Gabbard. The Halifax City News article, dated March 17, 2025, mentions Gabbard's comments about Trump and Putin.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Gabbard said Trump and Putin were "good friends." The Halifax City News article states that Gabbard said Trump is looking forward to success ahead of talks with Putin.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided evidence.


## Actions

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- _Zhann-_ like Жанн**очка** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem Миш- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as Миш**а** _Mish**a**_, Миш**енька** _Mish**enka**_, Миш**уня** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***Михаил**ушка _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T–V distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T–V distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _Анна_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _Ан**я**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _Ань**к**а_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -к- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _Ан**ечк**а_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -ечк/очк/оньк/усь/юсь/уль/юль- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(Ännchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Tsvetaeva.jpg/250px-Tsvetaeva.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tsvetaeva.jpg)

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg/250px-Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nikolay_Ge_040.jpg)

_Руслан_ (Ruslan), a character in [Alexander Pushkin](/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin "Alexander Pushkin")
's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _Руслан_ (Ruslan) is _Руся_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

Николай II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _Коля_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: краткое имя _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: полуимя _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 Верушка of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_еньк_\- (-yenk-), -_оньк_\- (-onk-), -_ечк_\- (-yechk-), -_ушк_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

| Full form | Short form | Diminutive form |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (Cyrillic/Latin) |     |     |
| Анна/Anna | Аня/Anya | Ан'ечк'а/Any'echk'a |
| Виктор/Viktor | Витя/Vitya | Витенька/Vitenʲka |
| Дмитрий/Dmitry | Дима/Dima | Димочка/Dimochka |
| Ольга/Olga | Оля/Olya | Оленька/Olyenka |
| Степан/Stepan | Стёпа/Styopa | Стёпочка/Styopochka |

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_к_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

| Full form |     | Short form |     | Colloquial diminutive form |     |

| (Cyrillic) | (Latin) | (Cyrillic) | (Latin) | (Cyrillic) | (Latin) |

_Колян_ (Kolyan), a character in the sitcom _Реальные пацаны_ ([Realnye Patsany](/w/index.php?title=Realnye_Patsany&action=edit&redlink=1 "Realnye Patsany (page does not exist)")
 \[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B "ru:Реальные пацаны")\
\], _Real Lads_). Kolyan shows viewers the ridiculous side of the life of [gopniks](/wiki/Gopnik "Gopnik")
, a subculture similar to British [chavs](/wiki/Chav "Chav")
.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_ян_ (-yan), -_он_ (-on), and -_ок/ёк_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

During the days of the [October Revolution](/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution")
, as part of the campaign to rid Russia of [bourgeois](/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie")
 culture, there was a drive to invent new, revolutionary names. As a result, many Soviet children were given atypical names, often being [acronyms](/wiki/Acronyms "Acronyms")

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: Марья Ивановна, могу я спросить..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") 'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "Ивашка, Антонов сын" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_ович_ (-ovich) for a son, -_овна_ (-ovna) – for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _Иван_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _Иванович_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _Ивановна_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _й_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_ович_ (-ovich) and -_овна_ (-ovna) becomes a _е_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_евич_ (-yevich) and -_евна_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _Дмитриевич_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _Дмитриевна_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _Дмитрович_ (Dmitrovich) or _Дмитровна_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _Дмитрий_ (Dmitry) ends on "й" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_ич_ (-ich) for a son and -_ична_ (-ichna) or -_инична_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father's first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father's first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _Иван Петров сын_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_ович_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names
------------

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_ов_ (-ov), -_ев_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
—or -_ский_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name _Писаренко_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _Ковальчук_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _Романовы_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _Романов_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _Борис Ельцин_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _Наина Ельцин**а**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_енко_ (_\-yenko_), -_ич_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _Иванов_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _Иванов_ | Ivanov | _Иванова_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _Ивано**ва**_ | Ivano**va** | _Ивано**ву**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _Ивано**вым**_ | Ivano**vym** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _Ивано**ве**_ | Ivano**ve** | _Ивано**вой**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: Иван**у** Жук**у** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but Анн**е** Жук (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _Муцуовна_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _ұлы_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _оглы/оғлу_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _қызы_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _Бруно Максимович Понтекорво_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _Джиль Брунович Понтекорво_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _Антонио Брунович Понтекорво_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _Тито Брунович Понтекорво_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_Петрович_ Petrovich, _Ивановна_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_Петров_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _Иван Иванович_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюрико**вич**и, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _Иван Иванович Петров_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_Петров Иван Иванович_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T–V distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _вы_ (vy, "you"); respectful _Вы_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _вы_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _ты_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_Вы_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T–V distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _Любимый / Любимая_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _Милый / Милая_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _Уважаемый / Уважаемая_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _Дорогой / Дорогая_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

Russian passport expiry date:

*   from 14 years old – until reaching the age of 20;
*   from 20 years – until reaching the age of 45;

**Russian passport machine-readable entry**
-------------------------------------------

Russian domestic passport has special rules and method of forming a machine-readable entry. The machine-readable record contains the surname, name, patronymic, date of birth (year, month, day) of the passport holder, sex of the passport holder, series and number of the passport, code of the migration department issuing the passport, date of issue of the passport, as well as the type of document, state issuing the passport, citizenship of the passport holder.

A machine-readable entry consists of two lines of 44 characters each. The machine-readable entry area is located in the opposite fold of the bottom quarter of the third page of the passport.

A machine-readable entry is entered into the passport with a special printer using the font OCR-B type 1 (Стандарт ИСО 1073/П).

To fill in the positions of characters 6–44 of the top line of a machine-readable record, the “modernized clair” information coding method is used, in which the letters of the Russian alphabet correspond to certain letters of the Latin alphabet and Arabic numbers:

There is a data structure of the upper and lower machine-readable lines.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport ID number

![Russia passport number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20318'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits – 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let’s look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:22>) is of an F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019. The crash was caused by a loss of hydraulic pressure due to improperly installed parts. The pilot ejected successfully.

The articles discussing the crash were published by The Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)), Air & Space Forces Magazine ([https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/)), and The Sun ([https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)).

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The image in the claim is of an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not as a result of the Russian invasion. While Ukraine has recently lost an F-16 in a crash, the image is not related to that event.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is taken out of context. The image is of a crash that occurred in 2019, not as a result of the Russian invasion. `false`
