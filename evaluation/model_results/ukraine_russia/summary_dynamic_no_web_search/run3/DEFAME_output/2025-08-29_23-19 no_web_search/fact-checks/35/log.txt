Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-ended-security-former-top-covid-official-anthony-fauci-2025-01-24/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 24, 2025, featuring an image of Dr. Anthony Fauci. <image:6827>

The claim 'In January 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin was seeking to have Dr. Anthony Fauci in the U.S. extradited to Russia in exchange for ending the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check involved multiple image searches to find evidence supporting the claim. While the searches yielded images of Dr. Anthony Fauci and Vladimir Putin, along with articles related to the war in Ukraine, none of the provided sources, including a Reuters article from January 24, 2025, mentioned Putin seeking Fauci's extradition in exchange for ending the war. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
