The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence, including maps from the Institute for the Study of War and AEI's Critical Threats Project ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-3-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-february-3-2025) and [https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-19-2025](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-19-2025)), and an article from The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-war-anniversary-russia-putin-zelensky-casualties-map-drones-b2703340.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-war-anniversary-russia-putin-zelensky-casualties-map-drones-b2703340.html)), focuses on the conflict's territorial control and Ukrainian casualties, but does not provide any data to support the claim about Russian troop losses.
