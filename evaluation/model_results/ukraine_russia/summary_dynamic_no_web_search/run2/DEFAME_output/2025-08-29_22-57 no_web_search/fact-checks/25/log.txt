The claim 'U.S. Vice President JD Vance's cousin Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years during its war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Nate Vance fought in Ukraine for three years cannot be verified. While evidence confirms that Nate Vance, the cousin of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, is fighting in Ukraine, none of the provided sources specify the duration of his service.

So, the overall veracity is: false
