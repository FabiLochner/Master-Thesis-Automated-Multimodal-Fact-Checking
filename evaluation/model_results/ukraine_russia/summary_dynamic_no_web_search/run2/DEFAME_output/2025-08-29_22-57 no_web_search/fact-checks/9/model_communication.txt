    Russian rockets are devastating large areas of eastern Ukraine
    
    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

8.  More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv.
    
    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.
    
    Here are some more pictures of his visit.

9.  Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kyiv, the presidential office says.
    
    Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said.
    
    "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state," the president told troops.
    
    The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

20.  Russia’s ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
    
    The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am.

Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops
===========================================================================================

!Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops <image:1659>

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

! <image:1663>

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows Zelensky in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the image is from Zelensky's visit to the front lines in the Kharkiv region. The BBC and Telegrafi.com articles ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803), [https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/)) confirm this.

The claim also mentions the Kursk Offensive, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence. The date of the image is not specified in the evidence, but the articles suggest it was taken during the ongoing conflict.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because it misidentifies the location and the context of the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:7>) appears in articles about Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the front lines in the Kharkiv region.

## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Zelensky in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the image is from Zelensky's visit to the front lines in the Kharkiv region. The BBC and Telegrafi.com articles ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803), [https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/)) confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate because it misidentifies the location and the context of the image.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows Volodymyr Zelensky in the Kharkiv region, not the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia. The claim also incorrectly states the date and the context of the image.

The claim is demonstrably false because the location and context of the image are misrepresented. `false`

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a Reuters article with an image of a building <image:6751> and a Yahoo article showing an oceanfront Florida mansion <image:6752>. One source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), contains no content.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 4, 2021, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy and offshore accounts (<image:6755>). NPR also contains an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6756>).

The Council on Foreign Relations was also searched, but no content was found.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and planes. One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/):

## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. The image searches show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes, but the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. More information is needed to verify the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy owns property and uses planes, but it does not provide enough information to verify the specific details of the claim, such as the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `not enough information`

One source from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338)) shows Zelenskyy. <image:6761> Another source from ABC News Australia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976)) also shows Zelenskyy near a plane. <image:6762>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. <image:6773>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information related to the claim, but it is insufficient to verify it entirely.

The image search results show that Zelenskyy has been associated with a Florida home and planes. However, the evidence does not confirm the number of homes, the value of the Florida home, the number of planes, the amount of money in an overseas bank account, or the monthly income.

The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could potentially be used to verify the claim, but the article's content is not included in the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check involved image searches related to Vladimir Putin, Dr. Anthony Fauci, extradition, and the war in Ukraine. The search results provided images of Putin, Fauci, and the war, but no evidence to support the claim that Putin sought Fauci's extradition in exchange for ending the war.

The decision option that best applies is `not enough information` because the fact-check did not find any evidence to support the claim. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence regarding Putin's alleged actions.

## Claim
Claim: "In January 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin was seeking to have Dr. Anthony Fauci in the U.S. extradited to Russia in exchange for ending the war in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
image_search("Vladimir Putin Anthony Fauci extradition")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles from ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/fauci-doubts-russias-covid-19-vaccine-safe-effective/story?id=72309297](https://abcnews.go.com/US/fauci-doubts-russias-covid-19-vaccine-safe-effective/story?id=72309297)) and National Geographic ([https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/fauci-seriously-doubts-russia-coronavirus-vaccine-is-ready-cvd](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/fauci-seriously-doubts-russia-coronavirus-vaccine-is-ready-cvd)) featuring images of Dr. Anthony Fauci (<image:6317>, <image:6319>).

Another search result from Duke Health ([https://dhvi.duke.edu/news/experts-express-doubts-over-russias-vaccine-claim](https://dhvi.duke.edu/news/experts-express-doubts-over-russias-vaccine-claim)) contains an image of Vladimir Putin (<image:6318>).


## Elaboration
The search results provide images of both Vladimir Putin and Dr. Anthony Fauci. However, the evidence does not contain any information about Putin seeking Fauci's extradition or linking it to the war in Ukraine. The provided links discuss Fauci's doubts about the safety and effectiveness of Russia's COVID-19 vaccine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Al Jazeera article, published on March 10, 2025, discusses Elon Musk's X account (<image:6831>). The Guardian published an article on June 17, 2025, with an image of Elon Musk (<image:6832>).

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there is evidence of Annalena Baerbock being in the news and criticizing Trump's comments on Zelenskyy in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that she threatened the US with severing ties. The search results provide images of Baerbock and articles about her, but none of them mention the specific threat.

The most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to assess the claim's veracity.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html)) reports on a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption <image:6904>. Bloomberg ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) reports that Ukrainian officials stole $40 million meant to buy arms <image:6905>. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reports on a corruption scheme uncovered in Ukraine's defense sector <image:6906>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Global Initiative website ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)) discusses a new phase of arms trafficking in Ukraine <image:6910>. The Financial Times ([https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8](https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8)) contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers with a multiple rocket launcher <image:6912>.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ([https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html)) contains an image of weapons in crates <image:6915>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States"

## Actions
```
image_search("Ukraine arms sales US")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68136840](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68136840)) contains an image of tanks <image:6900>. The search result from Vox.com ([https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/2/4/24059340/us-arms-exports-2023-ukraine-war-russia-gaza](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/2/4/24059340/us-arms-exports-2023-ukraine-war-russia-gaza)) contains an image of a tank <image:6903>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence consists of images of tanks from BBC News and Vox.com. However, the search results do not contain any information about Ukraine selling armaments received from the United States.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. More information is needed to assess the claim's veracity.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/world/europe/ukraine-weapons-politician-charged-corruption.html)) reports on a Ukrainian politician charged with corruption <image:6904>.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Global Initiative website ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)) discusses a new phase of arms trafficking in Ukraine <image:6910>. The Financial Times ([https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8](https://www.ft.com/content/bce78c78-b899-4dd2-b3a0-69d789b8aee8)) contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers with a multiple rocket launcher <image:6912>.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty ([https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-flood-of-arms-east-conflict-smuggling/27797454.html)) contains an image of weapons in crates <image:6915>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence reveals reports of corruption and arms trafficking in Ukraine. Specifically, there are reports of Ukrainian officials stealing funds meant for arms purchases ([https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia](https://www.bloomberg.com/en/news/thp/2024-01-28/ukraine-says-corrupt-officials-stole-40-million-meant-to-buy-arms-for-the-war-with-russia)) and a new phase of arms trafficking ([https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/a-new-phase-of-arms-trafficking-in-ukraine/)).

While the evidence suggests corruption and arms trafficking, it does not directly support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence does not specify the origin of the trafficked arms or the scale of any potential sales.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific evidence.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Forbes published an article on August 28, 2019, discussing Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2019/08/28/joe-bidens-net-worth-how-the-2020-presidential-candidate-built-a-9-million-fortune/)). The New York Times also published an article about Joe Biden's net worth, mentioning his adjusted gross income ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/joe-biden-net-worth.html)). Jagran Josh also discusses Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/joe-biden-net-worth-1673530564-1)). <image:6931> <image:6932> <image:6933>


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information on Mitch McConnell's net worth (<image:6936>). The Washington Post published an article about Mitch McConnell (<image:6937>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information about Nancy Pelosi's net worth. <image:6941> Forbes provides a profile of Nancy Pelosi. <image:6942>

The sources are: [https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668](https://www.investopedia.com/nancy-pelosi-net-worth-8690668), [https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/nancy-pelosi/net-worth?cid=N00007360&year=2018), and [https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/](https://www.forbes.com/profile/nancy-pelosi/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on June 16, 2023, about Ukraine battling corruption, including a photograph of Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy (<image:6943>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 28, 2023, about corruption in the US (<image:6944>).

## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:18>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim cannot be verified. The evidence provides information about the net worth of some of the politicians mentioned in the image but does not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Forbes published an article on August 28, 2019, discussing Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2019/08/28/joe-bidens-net-worth-how-the-2020-presidential-candidate-built-a-9-million-fortune/)). The New York Times also published an article about Joe Biden's net worth, mentioning his adjusted gross income ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/joe-biden-net-worth.html)). Jagran Josh also discusses Joe Biden's net worth ([Source](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/joe-biden-net-worth-1673530564-1)). <image:6931> <image:6932> <image:6933>


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information on Mitch McConnell's net worth (<image:6936>). The Washington Post published an article about Mitch McConnell (<image:6937>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
OpenSecrets.org provides information about Nancy Pelosi's net worth. <image:6941> Forbes provides a profile of Nancy Pelosi. <image:6942>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on June 16, 2023, about Ukraine battling corruption, including a photograph of Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy (<image:6943>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 28, 2023, about corruption in the US (<image:6944>). The Human Rights Watch published an article on July 24, 2025, about a new Ukrainian law that undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies (<image:6945>).


## Elaboration
The evidence provides information about the net worth of Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image is an authentic list released by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes. The search results mention articles about corruption in Ukraine and the US, but they do not validate the image's authenticity or the bribery allegations.

To verify the claim, I would need evidence from a credible source confirming the image's origin and the accuracy of the information presented. Specifically, I would need to see the original document released by Ukraine and corroborating evidence of the alleged bribes.

The claim remains unverified. While the new evidence includes a book cover investigating the Biden family's finances and an article about corruption schemes in Ukraine, it does not validate the image's authenticity or the specific bribery allegations. The evidence does not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine detailing bribes taken by US politicians.

The evidence indicates that there were California wildfires in January 2025. However, the evidence does not mention Russia offering assistance for these wildfires.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that there were California wildfires in January 2025. However, the evidence does not mention Russia offering assistance for these wildfires.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there were indeed California wildfires in January 2025, as evidenced by articles from sources like *The Guardian* and *The New York Times*, there is no supporting evidence to suggest that Russia offered assistance for these wildfires. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.

An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

The search results from Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Bluyellow-American-Embroidered-Military-Backpacks/dp/B0CG28DJVD](https://www.amazon.com/Bluyellow-American-Embroidered-Military-Backpacks/dp/B0CG28DJVD)), Etsy ([https://www.etsy.com/listing/1446788819/usa-ukrainian-national-flags-patch-us-ua](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1446788819/usa-ukrainian-national-flags-patch-us-ua)), and buypatch.net ([https://buypatch.net/products/copy-of-international-legion-ukraine-ukraine-war-flag-patch-velcro?srsltid=AfmBOorMWgFencNtYgMk9AkM8DPtO_k6cDX7jPrRy6ED0EXDqv32gChX](https://buypatch.net/products/copy-of-international-legion-ukraine-ukraine-war-flag-patch-velcro?srsltid=AfmBOorMWgFencNtYgMk9AkM8DPtO_k6cDX7jPrRy6ED0EXDqv32gChX)) show patches that combine the American and Ukrainian flags (<image:7016>, <image:7017>, <image:7018>).


## Elaboration
The evidence shows that patches combining the American and Ukrainian flags are available for sale. This suggests a connection between the two countries, but it does not confirm the presence of American mercenaries in Ukraine or their involvement in any specific military operations. The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The image shows individuals wearing uniforms with American flag patches. The claim asserts these are American mercenaries in Ukraine's Kursk Oblast in August 2024. While the image search provides some context about the conflict and the date, it does not confirm the presence of American mercenaries or their involvement in the specified incursion. The evidence also shows that patches combining the American and Ukrainian flags are available for sale.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image depicts American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. While the image shows individuals with American flag patches, and the image search provides context about the conflict, there is no evidence to confirm the presence of American mercenaries or their involvement in the specified military operation.
