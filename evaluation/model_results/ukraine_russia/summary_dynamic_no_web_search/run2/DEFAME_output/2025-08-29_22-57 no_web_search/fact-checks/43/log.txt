The claim 'Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim. While there are reports of corruption and misuse of US aid to Ukraine, the provided sources, including a Reuters article on aid packages and reports from the Institute for the Study of War and the Center for International Private Enterprise, do not mention the laundering of funds to Democrat candidates.

So, the overall veracity is: false
