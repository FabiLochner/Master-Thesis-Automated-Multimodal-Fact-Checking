# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Russian state TV aired a photo of a woman resembling Melania Trump. The image was displayed on a screen during a broadcast. The articles from La Voce di New York ([https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/12/melania-trump-risque-photos-aired-on-russian-tv-prime-time/](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/12/melania-trump-risque-photos-aired-on-russian-tv-prime-time/)), Livemint.com ([https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russian-media-air-nude-pics-of-melania-trump-after-donald-trump-wins-in-us-polls-netizens-say-russia-laughing-at-us-11731216282862.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russian-media-air-nude-pics-of-melania-trump-after-donald-trump-wins-in-us-polls-netizens-say-russia-laughing-at-us-11731216282862.html)), and Bluewin.ch ([https://www.bluewin.ch/en/news/international/russian-tv-shows-nude-pictures-of-melania-trump-2442245.html](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/news/international/russian-tv-shows-nude-pictures-of-melania-trump-2442245.html)) all support this.

The evidence does not explicitly state the exact timing of the broadcast relative to the 2024 U.S. presidential election. However, the Livemint.com article mentions the broadcast occurred "after Donald Trump wins in US polls".

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the airing of a photo resembling Melania Trump on Russian TV. However, the exact timing relative to the 2024 election is not explicitly confirmed, although it is implied.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Russian state TV aired a photo of a woman resembling Melania Trump. The image was displayed on a screen during a broadcast. The articles from La Voce di New York ([https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/12/melania-trump-risque-photos-aired-on-russian-tv-prime-time/](https://lavocedinewyork.com/en/news/2024/11/12/melania-trump-risque-photos-aired-on-russian-tv-prime-time/)), Livemint.com ([https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russian-media-air-nude-pics-of-melania-trump-after-donald-trump-wins-in-us-polls-netizens-say-russia-laughing-at-us-11731216282862.html](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/russian-media-air-nude-pics-of-melania-trump-after-donald-trump-wins-in-us-polls-netizens-say-russia-laughing-at-us-11731216282862.html)), and Bluewin.ch ([https://www.bluewin.ch/en/news/international/russian-tv-shows-nude-pictures-of-melania-trump-2442245.html](https://www.bluewin.ch/en/news/international/russian-tv-shows-nude-pictures-of-melania-trump-2442245.html)) all support this.

The evidence does not explicitly state the exact timing of the broadcast relative to the 2024 U.S. presidential election. However, the Livemint.com article mentions the broadcast occurred "after Donald Trump wins in US polls".

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the airing of a photo resembling Melania Trump on Russian TV. However, the exact timing relative to the 2024 election is not explicitly confirmed, although it is implied.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Euronews published an article on January 3, 2025, stating that Charlie Hebdo did not publish an issue with Zelenskyy as a caricature. The article includes an image of a Charlie Hebdo cover. (<image:6860>)

The search result shows an image of a Charlie Hebdo cover with a cartoon of Zelensky in a coffin. The text on the cover is in French. The cover is dated March 20, 2025. (<image:6861>)


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes two different Charlie Hebdo covers. One cover, dated January 3, 2025, does not feature Zelenskyy. The other cover, dated March 20, 2025, depicts Zelenskyy in a coffin, as described in the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War and AEI's Critical Threats Project published a map on February 3, 2025, showing the assessed control of terrain in the Russo-Ukrainian War (<image:6892>). Another source, dated February 19, 2025, also contains a map showing the Russia-Ukraine War frontline as of February 18, 2025 (<image:6894>).

An article published by The Independent on the Ukraine war anniversary includes statistics, such as the number of Ukrainian soldiers killed (46,000+) and the number of civilians killed in Ukraine since February 24, 2022 (12,654) (<image:6893>).

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the number of Russian troops lost in the Ukraine war. The evidence includes maps of the conflict and statistics on Ukrainian casualties and civilian deaths. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. While images with the E! News logo and USAID logo are circulating, the BBC Verify graphic indicates that the claim is false. Furthermore, the second source, a Twitter post, mentions Angelina Jolie and a sum of $20,000,000, but the source is a meme account, which is not a reliable source. The Gwara Media article debunks the claim, stating that E! News did not release a video about Hollywood stars receiving USAID money for visits to Ukraine.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ​​(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed “proof” a video with the logo of [E!News, a “celebrity and entertainment news” website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is “completely false.”

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ​​in addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account “Russia Informa,” which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as “USAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.” Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 “Irinamar,” which claims to share content with a “Russian view of the special operation in Ukraine,” or “[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
”, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, “one of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages”. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI’s motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

! <image:6464>

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated “by Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,” explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, “but also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,” as they identify in the published article.

! <image:6465>

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that “USAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.” This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with “different points of view.” In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present “different points of view” according to the platform’s rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree. 

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)
 that emerged on social networks as a result [of the DANA of October 2024](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241030/bulos-y-desinformaciones-sobre-el-paso-de-la-dana-en-el-este-y-sur-de-espana-en-octubre-de-2024/)
: out of 176 tweets analysed with disinformation narratives about heavy rains, only 8.5% had visible community notes. They were also not enough to stop the spread of the [hoax of the video of the European Parliament applauding the launch of missiles from Ukraine to Russia](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241125/parlamento-europeo-aplausos-misiles-ucrania/)
. This content was spread in at least [five different languages on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241126/bulo-parlamento-europeo-misiles-europa/)
 and none of those analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 had community notes.

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

! <image:6469>

The blue tick is no longer synonymous with the fact that a profile is verified and is who it claims to be. Now, [this badge is obtained by paying a subscription](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230331/tic-azul-twitter-blue-desinformacion-cuentas-verificadas/)
 fee, so anyone can access it. This change may give a false sense of security to the user viewing the content on their device.

**This disinformative narrative is circulated in at least nine languages within X**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents that have had the greatest impact so far are those disseminated in English. Of the 42 analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
, **13 have been published in English.** In total, they have had more than 18.4 million views (an average of 1.4 million per publication). 

! <image:6472>

The **content in French**, meanwhile, has an average of **106,000 views per tweet**. The nine tweets taken into account for this analysis reach almost one million reproductions (958,821 views in total). 

Although to a lesser extent and with less impact, content in Portuguese, Spanish, German and Romanian was also found. Four publications in each of these languages were used in this analysis. Of this group, those published in Portuguese and Spanish have had the greatest reach (with an average of 61,000 and 44,000 reproductions, respectively). There were also three tweets in Italian (with 44,000 total views) and two in Polish (with a total of 11,765 views) and one in Dutch (with 20,100 views).

These 42 pieces of content do not reflect the full impact of the dissemination of this narrative. During the analysis, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 **has located dozens of tweets** in localized languages ​​with less than 5,000 views. In addition, this misinformation [has been shared on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/#:~:text=El%20v%C3%ADdeo%20ha%20sido%20compartido%20en%20Twitter%2C%20ahora%20X%2C%20por%20Donald%20Trump%20Junior%20o%20Elon%20Musk)

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

In April, Hollywood actress and UN humanitarian Angelina Jolie [**made a surprise visit to Lviv**](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-angelina-jolie-seen-in-lviv-amid-russias-invasion-12602639)

“You’re my hero,” [Ben Stiller](https://deadline.com/tag/ben-stiller/)
 told Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://deadline.com/tag/volodymyr-zelenskyy/)
 today on a visit to Kyiv. “You gave up a great acting career for this,” the _Severance_ filmmaker joked with the former _Servant of the People_ star.

“Not so great as you,” Zelenskyy responded with perfect comic timing to laughing UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Stiller.

Showing up in [Ukraine](https://deadline.com/tag/ukraine/)
 on World Refugee Day, Stiller is the latest in a procession of high-profile guests to the country since Vladimir Putin and Russia’s bloody invasion launched on February 24. Contributing billions in financial and weaponry support as well as leading NATO’s overall efforts, President [Joe Biden](https://deadline.com/tag/joe-biden/)
 has not yet shown up in Kyiv yet.

### Watch on Deadline

POTUS today said that is “not likely” he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to “cause more difficulty for Ukrainians” by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. “It’s one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,” said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo’s sit-down. “That’s a lot more shocking.”

“What you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,” the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. “But it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.”

Earlier, Stiller filmed a brief video for social media unveiling his trip, as you can see below:

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky is found in multiple sources. One source, [Maldita.es](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/), discusses a disinformation campaign claiming that USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine and states that the claim that Stiller was paid $4 million is false. Sky News ([https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-ben-stiller-visits-kyiv-and-tells-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-you-are-my-hero-12636878)) and Deadline ([https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/](https://deadline.com/2022/06/ukraine-zelensky-ben-stiller-visit-international-refugee-day-joe-biden-russia-war-1235048800/)) also feature the image and report on Stiller's visit to Kyiv on June 20, 2022. <image:6456>, <image:6457>, <image:6464>, <image:6465>, <image:6466>, <image:6467>, <image:6468>, <image:6469>, <image:6472>, <image:6474>, <image:6477>, <image:6481>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article about Ben Stiller's meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky (<image:6916>). The BBC News website shows a video of Ben Stiller meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (<image:6917>). The image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (<image:6918>).

The image in the claim shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (<image:17>).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm the meeting took place on that date. However, the claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is false, according to Maldita.es ([https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/)).


## Final Judgement
The image does show Ben Stiller and Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022. However, the claim that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is false.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim accurately depicts Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022. However, the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID is false, as reported by [Maldita.es](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/hollywood-disinformation-twitter-community-notes/).

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of wildfires in Los Angeles. One source, from [Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/january-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-once-generation-events-now-happen-frequently), shows an image of wildfires <image:6922>. Reuters published images of wildfires in Los Angeles <image:6923> ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-los-angeles-wildfires-rage-2025-01-08/3TQRCJ3GGFNF5I6YEQ3524YLTE/)).

Britannica.com also contains an image of a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires <image:6924> ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of areas damaged by wildfires in Los Angeles. One source, from NPR, shows a coastal area with fire damage <image:6928>. Another source, from The New York Times, provides an aerial view of the damage <image:6929>. A third source, from CFR.org, shows a neighborhood destroyed by fire <image:6930>.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm whether any mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of wildfires in Los Angeles. One source, from [Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/january-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-once-generation-events-now-happen-frequently), shows an image of wildfires <image:6922>. Reuters published images of wildfires in Los Angeles <image:6923> ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-los-angeles-wildfires-rage-2025-01-08/3TQRCJ3GGFNF5I6YEQ3524YLTE/)).

Britannica.com also contains an image of a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires <image:6924> ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of areas damaged by wildfires in Los Angeles. One source, from NPR, shows a coastal area with fire damage <image:6928>. Another source, from The New York Times, provides an aerial view of the damage <image:6929>. A third source, from CFR.org, shows a neighborhood destroyed by fire <image:6930>.

The provided sources do not mention any information about Ukrainian military officials or their mansions.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were wildfires in Los Angeles in January 2025, and that these fires caused significant damage. However, the search results do not contain any information about Ukrainian military officials or their mansions being affected by the fires.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm whether any mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down.


## Actions
```
image_search("Ukrainian military officials Los Angeles wildfires")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 13, 2025, about Zelenskyy offering Ukraine's help to fight California wildfires, including an image of military personnel (<image:6938>). The Los Angeles Times published an image of firefighters extinguishing a fire (<image:6939>).

## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that Ukraine offered assistance to California during the wildfires, including sending firefighters. However, the search results still do not provide any information about Ukrainian military officials' mansions being burned down.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that Ukraine offered assistance to California during the wildfires, including sending firefighters. However, the search results still do not provide any information about Ukrainian military officials' mansions being burned down.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Actions
```
image_search("Los Angeles wildfire damage mansions Ukrainian military officials")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the existence of wildfires in Los Angeles in January 2025 and Ukraine's offer of assistance. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down.

**Verdict:** The claim is unverified due to a lack of supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the existence of wildfires in Los Angeles in January 2025 and Ukraine's offer of assistance. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down.

The claim is not supported by the available evidence, as there is no mention of Ukrainian military officials' mansions being affected by the wildfires. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there were indeed wildfires in Los Angeles in January 2025, and Ukraine offered assistance, there is no evidence to support the claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The search results confirm that the Wall Street Journal published an article about J.D. Vance, but the content of the article, specifically whether Vance made the statement about US military action against Russia, is not available.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Wall Street Journal published an article about J.D. Vance. However, the evidence does not specify the content of the article or whether Vance discussed military action against Russia.

To verify the claim, I need to access the Wall Street Journal article from February 14, 2025, and check if Vance made the statement.

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Ukrainian drone attack on a significant Russian weapons stockpile in the Tver region in the early hours of Wednesday might be the Ukrainian army's biggest hit against Moscow's arsenal since early 2022.

The blast from the strike was so strong that earthquake monitoring stations picked it up as if it were a minor earthquake, while NASA reported a series of heat sources spotted by its equipment from space.

The facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored around 30,000 tonnes of military munitions. The destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army.

But what is the Russian military storage facility in Toropets and how important is it?

Renovated in 2018, the facility in Toropets is estimated to have stored tonnes upon tonnes of military goods, including explosives, artillery shells and ballistic missiles.

The former Russian deputy defence minister Dmitry Bulgakov — who was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges — said after the renovations that the site met the "highest international standards" and could defend weapons from missiles and "even a small nuclear attack".

The storage site covered an area of over 5 square kilometres in size and a perimeter of more than 12 kilometres long. 

**Which missiles were stored at the facility?**
-----------------------------------------------

The town of Toropets is situated around 470 kilometers north of the Ukrainian border and the destruction of the ammunition that was stored there will most likely negatively affect the northern operational group of the Russian army, including the supply of troops in Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk.

According to Ukrainian sources, the military site in Toropets reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as missiles intended for Iskander missile systems, Tochka-U missile systems, guided aerial bombs and assorted artillery ammunition.

The head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that in addition to its own ammunition, Russia had also started to store North Korean munitions in Toropets.

Maxar satellite service collected imagery clearly shows the extent of the damage from the Ukrainian drone attack causing a series of explosions, according to a photo shared by the Russia Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). 

The imagery shows large pillars of smoke covering much of the area, while a closer look at the ammunition storage area indicates that fires continue to burn in and near some bunkers, ISW's George Barros added.

**Have the storage bunkers been destroyed?**
--------------------------------------------

Most of the ammunition is presumably stored underground, so the question is whether Ukraine used any drones that could have penetrated inside the bunkers.

A full damage assessment remains impossible due to the thick smoke above the site. However, the possible destruction of the bunkers might have also been the result of Moscow not respecting its own regulations by placing the bunkers too close together, for example.

While repeatedly calling on the West to lift the restrictions over the use of long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, Ukraine has been using its home-produced UAVs to strike as deep as 1,800 kilometres into Russia, as was the case in the city of Orsk.

*   Ukrainian drone attack hits major Russian arsenal
*   Massive blasts detected by earthquake monitors
*   NASA picks up multiple heat sources from space
*   Some anger expressed in Russia over the attack

LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - A large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia triggered an earthquake-sized blast at a major arsenal in the Tver region on Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a nearby town, war bloggers and some media reported.

Unverified video and images on social media showed a huge ball of flame blasting into the night sky and multiple detonations thundering across a lake about 380 km (240 miles) west of Moscow.

NASA satellites picked up intense heat sources emanating from an area of about 14 square kilometres (5 square miles) at the site in the early hours and earthquake monitoring stations noted what sensors thought was a small [earthquake, opens new tab](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/9611698/mag2quake-Sep-18-2024-BALTIC-STATES-BELARUS-NW-RUSSIA-REGION.html#google_vignette)
 in the area.

"The enemy hit an ammunition depot in the area of Toropets," said Yuri Podolyaka, a Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger. "Everything that can burn is already burning there (and exploding)."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, hailed the outcome of the attack without referring specifically to the target.

"A very important result was achieved last night on Russian territory and such actions weaken the enemy," Zelenskiy said. "I thank everyone involved. Such precision is truly inspiring."

He thanked the SBU security service, the HUR intelligence service and the Special Operations Forces.

A source in Ukraine's SBU state security service had earlier told Reuters the drone attack had destroyed [a warehouse storing missiles](/world/europe/ukraine-destroyed-arsenal-russias-tver-region-kyiv-security-source-says-2024-09-18/)
, guided bombs and artillery ammunition.

Russian state media have in the past reported that a major arsenal for conventional weapons was located at the site of the blasts. State media, now subject to military censorship laws, was muted in its reporting on Wednesday.

Igor Rudenya, governor of the Tver region, said that Ukrainian drones had been shot down, that a fire had broken out and that some residents were being evacuated. He did not say what was burning.

One woman told Reuters that members of her family had been evacuated from Toropets.

"A fire started with explosions," said the woman, who identified herself only as Irina.

Rudenya later said the situation in Toropets was stable as of midday local time (0900 GMT) and that evacuated residents could return. The fire had been put out and there were no recorded fatalities, he said.

Russia and Ukraine each reported dozens of enemy drone attacks on their territory overnight, with Russian forces advancing in eastern [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)

MAJOR EXPLOSION
---------------

The size of the main blast shown in the unverified social media video was consistent with 200-240 tons of high explosives detonating, said George William Herbert of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California.

A Toropets chatroom on the Russian social media site VK was flooded with messages of support from other parts of the country and offers of help to people fleeing the town.

Some people were asking whether buildings at specific addresses were still standing.

"People, does anyone know what's happened to Kudino village??? They told me nothing is left of our house," posted one woman.

Another woman replied: "It's horror there." Kudino is a village 4.5 km (2.8 miles) northeast of Toropets.

Some war bloggers asked how drones could trigger such large blasts at what was thought to be a highly fortified facility.

According to an RIA state news agency report from 2018, Russia was building an arsenal for the storage of missiles, ammunition and explosives in Toropets, a 1,000-year-old town, with a population of just over 11,000.

Dmitry Bulgakov, then a deputy defence minister, told RIA in 2018 that the facility could defend weapons from missiles and even a small nuclear attack. Bulgakov was arrested earlier this year on corruption charges, which he denies.

"It (the concrete facilities) ensures their reliable and safe storage, protects them from air and missile strikes and even from the damaging factors of a nuclear explosion," RIA quoted Bulgakov as saying at the time.

Some Russians on chat groups expressed anger.

"Why wasn't the ammunition underground?! What are you doing???? In Kudino, houses were blown away! Why is the forest burning and no one is there... What kind of negligence is this!!!!" one woman posted.

Russia reported that its air defence units had destroyed 54 drones launched against five Russian regions overnight, without mentioning Tver. Ukraine said it had [shot down 46 of 52 drones](/world/europe/russian-drones-attack-energy-facilities-ukraines-sumy-authorities-say-2024-09-18/)
 launched by Moscow overnight and that Russia had used three guided air missiles which did not reach their targets.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian [drones struck a large military depot in a town deep inside Russia](https://apnews.com/article/poland-us-blinken-duda-ukraine-54232b14cae7785df02f9d48a77e7823)
 overnight, causing a huge fire and forcing some residents to evacuate, a Ukrainian official and Russian news reports said Wednesday. At least 13 people were injured, Russia’s Health Ministry added.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. diplomat said [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-gamble-battlefield-e862afd58c65d6d2d5b7b3747423ca4d)
 has a workable plan to end the war, now in its third year, although its details have not been publicly disclosed.

Ukraine claimed the strike destroyed military warehouses in Toropets, a town in Russia’s Tver region about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and about 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

The attack was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, along with Ukraine’s Intelligence and Special Operations Forces, a Kyiv security official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the operation.

According to the official, the depot housed Iskander and Tochka-U missiles, as well as glide bombs and artillery shells. He said the facility caught fire in the strike and was burning across an area 6 kilometers (4 miles) wide.

Among the destroyed ammunition were North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles, another official, in Ukraine’s Intelligence Office, told AP. He also was not authorized to comment publicly and didn’t provide evidence to support his claim.

Russia and North Korea signed [a landmark pact](https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-kim-north-korea-pact-556492779b6a32c4cf74b992741d91a8)
 in June that envisioned mutual military assistance between Moscow and Pyongyang.

More than 100 domestically produced exploding drones were deployed in the attack on the depot, the Ukrainian intelligence official added.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted regional authorities as saying air defense systems were working to repel a “massive drone attack” on Toropets, which has a population of about 11,000. The agency also reported a fire and the evacuations, and the Health Ministry said 13 people were hospitalized in the region after the attack.

Tver regional Gov. Igor Rudenya later said all evacuees could return home.

Successful Ukrainian strikes deep inside Russia have become more common as Kyiv developed its drone technology.

Zelenskyy also is seeking approval from Western nations for Ukraine to use the sophisticated weapons they are providing to hit targets inside Russia. Some Western leaders have balked at that, fearing they could be dragged into the conflict.

Part of Kyiv’s strategy is targeting of military equipment, ammunition and infrastructure deep inside Russia, as well as making civilians feel some of the consequences of the war that is being fought largely inside Ukraine.

The swift push by Ukrainian forces [into Russia’s Kursk border region](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-kursk-incursion-putin-1178b99b32b476816db3a48ffa06b11a)
 last month fits into that plan, which apparently seeks to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to back down.

Putin, however, has shown no signs of that [and has been trying to grind down Ukraine’s resolve](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 through attritional warfare and also sap the West’s support for Kyiv by drawing out the conflict. That has come at a price, however, as the U.K. Defense Ministry estimates the war has probably killed or wounded more than 600,000 Russian troops.

On Tuesday, Putin ordered the country’s military to [increase its number of troops](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-military-numbers-9c5554302486adfe7b3d69cb297f8a98)
 by 180,000 to a total of 1.5 million by Dec. 1.

Zelenskyy announced his war plan in his nightly address on Monday, saying it’s 90% ready and will be presented to allies over the next week.

He said Ukraine’s [plan for victory](https://apnews.com/video/ukraine-government-kyiv-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-war-and-unrest-be06ac55f33246fd96f1898bac5a6884)
 includes not only battlefield goals but also diplomatic and economic wins. The plan has been kept under wraps but the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said at a news conference Tuesday that Washington officials have seen it.

“We think it lays out a strategy and a plan that can work,” she said, adding that the United States will bring it up with other world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. She did not comment on what the plan contained.

These articles report on a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian arms depot in Toropets, Tver region.

The depot, which stored munitions including explosives, artillery shells, and ballistic missiles, was struck on September 18, 2024, causing a large explosion and fire. The depot housed missiles for Iskander and Tochka-U systems, guided aerial bombs, artillery ammunition, and North Korean munitions. The Reuters article also mentions that the facility was designed to withstand missile strikes and even a small nuclear attack.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a strike. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the strike was a nuclear one from NATO. The articles from Euronews, Reuters, and the Associated Press state that the depot was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack. The Reuters article mentions that the facility was designed to withstand missile strikes and even a small nuclear attack, but it does not state that it was hit by a nuclear weapon.

The claim that the strike was a nuclear one from NATO is not supported by the provided evidence.

These articles report on a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian arms depot in Toropets, Tver region.

The depot, which stored munitions including explosives, artillery shells, and ballistic missiles, was struck on September 18, 2024, causing a large explosion and fire. The depot housed missiles for Iskander and Tochka-U systems, guided aerial bombs, artillery ammunition, and North Korean munitions. The Reuters article also mentions that the facility was designed to withstand missile strikes and even a small nuclear attack.


### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about a Russian weapons depot ([https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/18/europe/ukraine-russian-weapons-depot-drone-attack-intl)) with an image of the depot <image:2746>. The BBC News website contains an image of an explosion <image:2747>.

The Washington Post published an article with an image of a fire <image:2748> ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/18/ukraine-russia-blast-drones-missiles-tver/)).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bhutan': 0.24, 'China': 0.21, 'Malaysia': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.09, 'Ghana': 0.09, 'Taiwan': 0.07, 'Madagascar': 0.03, 'Nigeria': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows a Russian ammunition depot in Toropets, Tver Oblast, before and after a strike. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the strike was a nuclear one from NATO. The articles from Euronews, Reuters, and the Associated Press state that the depot was hit by a Ukrainian drone attack. The Reuters article mentions that the facility was designed to withstand missile strikes and even a small nuclear attack, but it does not state that it was hit by a nuclear weapon.

The claim that the strike was a nuclear one from NATO is not supported by the provided evidence.
