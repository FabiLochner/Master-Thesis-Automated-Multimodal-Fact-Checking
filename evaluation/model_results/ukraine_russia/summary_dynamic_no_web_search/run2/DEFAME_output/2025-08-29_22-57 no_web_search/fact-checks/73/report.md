## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 22](media/73.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse in May 2019. The crash occurred near March Air Reserve Base due to improperly installed parts and hydraulic failure. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, and the missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

## Elaboration
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed near March Air Reserve Base in May 2019, not during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The crash was due to mechanical failure, not being shot down. The pilot ejected safely.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate. The image shows a 2019 crash of an F-16 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, not a Russian attack in Ukraine. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a 2019 crash of an F-16 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, as reported by the [Press-Enterprise](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/), [Air & Space Forces Magazine](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/improperly-installed-parts-caused-f-16-to-crash-into-warehouse-in-may-2019/), and the [San Bernardino Sun](https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/). The claim incorrectly attributes the image to a Russian attack in Ukraine.
