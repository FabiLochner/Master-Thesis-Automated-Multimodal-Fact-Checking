Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-set-european-summit-london-after-trump-showdown/story?id=119338966): 
Content: ABC News reports on a European summit in London on Ukraine. The article includes an image of the leaders at a table. <image:6680>

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a summit on Ukraine did take place in London on March 2, 2023, as reported by sources like [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/03/02/zelensky-joins-european-leaders-at-key-ukraine-summit-in-london_6738729_4.html) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/2/european-leaders-gather-in-london-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine), the available images from the summit, such as those found in the articles, do not depict the leaders removing their suits.

So, the overall veracity is: false
