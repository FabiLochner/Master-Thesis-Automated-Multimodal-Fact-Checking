## Elaboration
The evidence contains an image of John Thune. However, the provided source does not contain any information about Adam Schiff or his committee assignments. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

I need more information to verify the claim, such as:

*   News articles or reports detailing the reasons behind any blocking of committee assignments.
