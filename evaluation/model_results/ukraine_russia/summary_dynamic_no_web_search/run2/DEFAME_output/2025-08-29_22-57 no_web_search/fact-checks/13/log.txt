The claim '<image:10> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wearing a suit after the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine: in a talk with Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, a reverse image search reveals that the photo was taken on January 22, 2020, well before the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, making the claim inaccurate. The image can be found on [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg).
