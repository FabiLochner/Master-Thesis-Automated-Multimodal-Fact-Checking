The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because the search results did not provide any evidence of the alleged statement made by Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an AP news interview on February 1, 2025. The search results provided images of Zelenskyy and links to news articles, but none of them contained the specific statement. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
