## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a Russian missile attack hit a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024. The image in the claim (![image 8](media/10.jpg)) is associated with the aftermath of this attack. The presence of children's toys in the image could be interpreted as a sign of the hospital's function.

The claim states that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be determined with the available evidence. More information is needed to verify whether the toys were photoshopped.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC published a video about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv (![image 6681](media/2025-08-29_23-01-1756508480-895422.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence continues to lack information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because there is no evidence to confirm or deny that the toys were photoshopped. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the image shows photoshopped toys is unverified. While the image depicts the aftermath of a Russian attack on a Kyiv children's hospital on July 8, 2024, as reported by sources like the [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/), [RBC-Ukraine](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/rosiya-obstrilyala-kiyiv-pid-udarom-okhmadit-1720448789.html), and [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/11/russias-july-8-attack-childrens-hospital-ukraine), the provided evidence does not offer any information to confirm or deny the authenticity of the toys in the image.
