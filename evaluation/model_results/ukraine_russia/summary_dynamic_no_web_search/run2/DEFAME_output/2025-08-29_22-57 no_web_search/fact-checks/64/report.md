## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump had a press conference on February 24, 2025. However, the provided sources do not contain any information about Macron calling Putin a "butcher" during the press conference.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional sources would be needed to confirm whether Macron made the statement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/24/macron-tells-trump-europe-wants-to-secure-solid-peace-in-ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/24/macron-tells-trump-europe-wants-to-secure-solid-peace-in-ukraine)) published an image of Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump on February 24, 2025 (![image 6962](media/2025-08-29_23-12-1756509175-525648.jpg)).

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/](https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-arrives-white-house-ukraine-talks-with-trump-2025-02-24/)) also published an image of Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump on February 24, 2025 (![image 6964](media/2025-08-29_23-12-1756509176-572381.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms the meeting between Macron and Trump on February 24, 2025. However, it still does not provide any information about Macron calling Putin a "butcher" during the press conference.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Axios published an image of Emmanuel Macron. The Moscow Times published an image of Emmanuel Macron and discusses Biden calling Putin a "butcher" (![image 6966](media/2025-08-29_23-13-1756509195-010306.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about Macron calling Putin a "butcher." Therefore, the claim is unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Macron and Trump met on February 24, 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Macron called Putin a "butcher" during the press conference. The search results do not provide any information about Macron using that specific term.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump did hold a press conference on February 24, 2025, as evidenced by sources like [VPM.org/NPR News](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2025-02-24/trump-and-macron-meet-in-washington-as-europe-pleads-for-continued-help-with-ukraine) and [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-02-24-25?Date=20250224&Profile=cnnbrk), there is no supporting evidence to confirm that Macron referred to Vladimir Putin as a "butcher" during the event.
