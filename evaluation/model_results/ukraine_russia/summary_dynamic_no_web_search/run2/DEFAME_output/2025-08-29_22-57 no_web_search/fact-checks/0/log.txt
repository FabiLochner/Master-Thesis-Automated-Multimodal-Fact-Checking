Useful result: From [Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-hull-daily-mail-didnt-write-about-70000-ukrainian-soldiers-killed-in-russias-kursk-oblast/): 
Content: The search result from gwaramedia.com shows an image of the Hull Daily Mail front page with the headline "70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain". The image has a "FAKE" stamp on it. <image:6643>

The claim '<image:1> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Hull Daily Mail's frontpage from March 13, 2025 saying '70,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region died in vain. The UK poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Zelensky's crushing failure'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The provided image of the Hull Daily Mail front page is not authentic. Evidence from image searches reveals a genuine front page from March 13, 2025, with a different headline, and another source explicitly labels the image as "FAKE" ([<image:6643>](https://gwaramedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fake-1.jpg)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
