The claim 'During his visit to the White House in April 2025 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House and discussions about the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza exist, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
