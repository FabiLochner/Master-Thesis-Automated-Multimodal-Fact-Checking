Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/21/us-president-trumps-claims-about-zelenskyy-and-ukraine-fact-checked): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on February 21, 2025, fact-checking claims about Zelenskyy and Trump. <image:6770>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the U.S. will have 'to send their sons and daughters' to die for Ukraine after having a heated exchange with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the statement about the U.S. sending troops to Ukraine after a heated exchange with Donald Trump. While images confirm that the two leaders met at the White House, the search results, including articles from sources like Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/20/no-us-troops-in-ukraine-trump-says)), do not contain the alleged quote.

So, the overall veracity is: false
