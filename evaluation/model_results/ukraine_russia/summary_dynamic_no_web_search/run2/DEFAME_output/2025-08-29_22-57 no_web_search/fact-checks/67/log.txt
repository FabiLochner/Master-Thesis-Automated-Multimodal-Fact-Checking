The claim 'Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires from January 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while there were indeed California wildfires in January 2025, as evidenced by articles from sources like *The Guardian* and *The New York Times*, there is no supporting evidence to suggest that Russia offered assistance for these wildfires. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
