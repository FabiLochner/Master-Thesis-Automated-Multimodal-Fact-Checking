The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/2022/06/24/chinese-russian-warships-continue-to-circle-japan-defense-minister-says) shows Chinese warships near Japan, and [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/d345a6e7-2d72-4dcb-9c12-76d571ba75eb) provides a map with military symbols, neither source provides evidence of a planned invasion of Russia by China and Japan.

So, the overall veracity is: false
