## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Kamala Harris has made speeches and statements regarding Ukraine and Russia. However, none of the provided evidence contains the exact quote from the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. I would need to find a transcript or recording of a speech by Kamala Harris to confirm if she made the statement.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Kamala Harris has spoken about Ukraine and Russia, but they do not contain the exact quote in the claim. Without a transcript or recording of the speech, it is impossible to verify the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The provided evidence, including images and articles from various news sources, confirms that Kamala Harris has discussed Ukraine and Russia in her speeches. However, the search results do not contain the specific quote attributed to her in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
