Useful result: From [Source](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-fakes-no-enews-didnt-release-video-about-hollywood-stars-receiving-usaid-money-for-visits-to-ukraine/): 
Content: The search result includes an image that appears to be a screenshot from E! News, claiming that USAID sponsored American celebrity visits to Ukraine. <image:6902> The image also mentions Angelina Jolie and a sum of $20,000,000. The source of the image is a Twitter post by "I Meme Therefore I Am".

The claim 'E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While images with the E! News and USAID logos are circulating, the BBC Verify graphic indicates the claim is false. Furthermore, the Gwara Media article debunks the claim, stating that E! News did not release a video about Hollywood stars receiving USAID money for visits to Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
