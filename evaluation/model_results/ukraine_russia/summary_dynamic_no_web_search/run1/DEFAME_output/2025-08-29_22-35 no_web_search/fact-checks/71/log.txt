The claim 'In October 2024 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while the IMF did release economic forecasts in October 2024, including projections for Russia's GDP growth, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Russia's economic ranking at that time. Therefore, the claim that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world in October 2024 is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
