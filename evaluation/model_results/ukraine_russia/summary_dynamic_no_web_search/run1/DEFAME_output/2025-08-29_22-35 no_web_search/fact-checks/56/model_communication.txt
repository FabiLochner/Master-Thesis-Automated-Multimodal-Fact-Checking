Claves:

*   The disinformation campaign that claims that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has paid for celebrities to visit Ukraine has spread in at least nine languages
*   Maldita.es has analyzed more than 40 Twitter posts (now X) with this narrative that, in just three days, has more than 20 million views and only 14% have a note from the community denying it
*   Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have published this disinformation narrative since the first day it began to be distributed

The video claiming that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [has paid for visits by several prominent US officials to Ukraine](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 has gone viral with (fake) messages **in at least nine different languages** ‚Äã‚Äã(German, Spanish, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian). Its impact has thus crossed borders, reaching more than 20 million views [on Twitter (now X)](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230724/twitter-x-cambio-nombre-logo-elon-musk/)
 in just three days.

For this study, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has analysed [more than 40 posts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 (all of them with more than 5,000 views at 5pm on 7 February 2025) that spread this video with disinformation messages through X. These contents have been published over three days (between 5 and 7 February) and, together, they add up to millions of views on the platform. Even so, only 14.3% (that is, six out of 42) have [community notes](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
 warning users that it is disinformation content.

! <image:6457>

The narrative was also widely disseminated by channels and websites linked to or close to the Kremlin, both in Spain and in Russia and other countries between February 5 and 7.

**This disinformation narrative has 20 million views in three days and nine languages**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The narrative shared in X:** USAID has sponsored visits by American celebrities (such as Angelina Jolie, Ben Stiller, Orlando Bloom, Sean Penn, and Jean-Claude Van Damme) to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, in order to boost Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs popularity in the United States and better coordinate its funding programs. Much of the content provides as supposed ‚Äúproof‚Äù a video with the logo of [E!News, a ‚Äúcelebrity and entertainment news‚Äù website in the United States](https://archive.ph/s1f93)
.

**The fact-check:** [The video circulating is not from E!News](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
. There is also [**no evidence**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/)
 **of USAID's alleged payments to the celebrities it mentions.** Ben Stiller, the American actor and comedian who is the subject of the disinformation, has said that it is ‚Äúcompletely false.‚Äù

Even so, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [has located up to 42 contents with more than 5,000 views](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gRE1WgvW3L5ECNejPxnxvudHNbJJQpdIW3HINA9UCo4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
 as of February 7 that spread this narrative on X. These have been published between February 5 and 7, 2025 and are shared in at least seven languages ‚Äã‚Äãin addition to Spanish: German, French, English, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Romanian. Some [have several million views](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 and, together (and in just three days), they add up to more than 20 million views within this platform alone.

**Channels and websites linked to the Kremlin have been publishing this disinformation narrative since February 5**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since February 5, social media channels linked to the Kremlin or that routinely share disinformation pushed by Russia have also been spreading the video accusing USAID of paying Hollywood stars to travel to Ukraine.

On February 5, the X account ‚ÄúRussia Informa,‚Äù which has almost 80,000 followers, [shared the video](https://archive.li/OMGEP)
 with claims such as ‚ÄúUSAID paid Hollywood stars to visit Kyiv after the start of the special operation. The E!News portal published the details. Angelina Jolie cost the most: 20 million.‚Äù Also [the Telegram channel](https://archive.ph/NEJeQ)
 ‚ÄúIrinamar,‚Äù which claims to share content with a ‚ÄúRussian view of the special operation in Ukraine,‚Äù or ‚Äú[Wars and Geopolitics](https://archive.ph/rTjNU)
‚Äù, among others, published a post that same day.

On February 6, it was shared **by the website Spanish News Pravda**, a website that is part of the Pravda ecosystem and that, according to the [Viginum agency](https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/notre-organisation/composantes/service-de-vigilance-et-protection-contre-les-ingerences-numeriques)
, belonging to the General Secretariat of National Defense and Security of France, ‚Äúone of its main objectives is to spread disinformation and pro-Russian propaganda in different EU languages‚Äù. In Spain, [Spanish News Pravda has published](https://maldita.es/index.php/malditobulo/20241106/comitiva-rey-paginas-rusas-arabe/)
 disinformation such as the hoax about Felipe VI‚Äôs motorcade in Valencia after the passage of the DANA [or the hoax that Coca-Cola had donated mobile morgues](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241203/morgue-mobile-cocacola-ucrania/)
 with its logo to Ukraine. On this occasion, Spanish News Pravda published it on two occasions ([1](https://archive.ph/bqahS)
 and [2](https://archive.li/PdxYX)
).

Liu Sivaya [also shared the E!News video](https://archive.li/2hpjN)
 on the 6th on her X account, where she has nearly 200,000 followers.

! <image:6464>

Between February 5 and 6, it was also actively disseminated ‚Äúby Russian propaganda outlets, including Tsargrad, Russia Today, EurAsia Daily, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Military Review, and Vesti,‚Äù explain Georgian fact-checkers [Myth Detector, who have also verified the content](https://mythdetector.com/en/usaid-paid-actors/)
. They add that it was shared not only by Kremlin-controlled outlets, ‚Äúbut also by networks affiliated with the Georgian government, including the pro-government POSTV, several media channels, as well as individual accounts,‚Äù as they identify in the published article.

! <image:6465>

**Only six of the 42 disinformation contents have Community Notes**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publication of this text, 85.7% of the contents analysed (i.e. 37 out of 42) **are circulating on X without** [**community notes**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/)
. Only in six of the more than 40 cases does the warning system of Elon Musk's platform indicate that they are disinformation content. These posts are written in Spanish (3), German (1), French (1) and English (1). None of the contents with more than 5,000 views that have been taken into account in this analysis in Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch or Romanian contain these messages.

! <image:6466>

Those cases in which the Community Notes have been applied do not reach 125.000 views in any single post. In fact, [the tweet with the most impact](https://archive.ph/xuARn)
 that [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 has found with this narrative (which has, as of the date of publication of this text, more than 15.8 million views) [**does not have a visible warning**](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250207/ben-stiller-tuit-desinformador-nota-comunidad/)
**,** more than 36 hours after its publication. It is the first post in a thread in English that states that ‚ÄúUSAID paid Ben Stiller 4 million dollars to take these photos with Zelensky.‚Äù This message is accompanied by two images (which are real) of the American actor and comedian with the president of Ukraine.

! <image:6467>

[Community Notes is the system implemented](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
 in X that allows users to add context to misleading tweets. [Although this is only selected and displayed when it is rated](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20240917/notas-de-la-comunidad-twitter-x/#:~:text=en%20la%20desinformaci%C3%B3n%3F-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20funcionan%20las%20Notas%20de%20la%20comunidad%3F,-Las%20Notas%20de)
 as useful by enough contributors with ‚Äúdifferent points of view.‚Äù In fact**,** [**there are actually notes proposed**](https://archive.is/QieM8)
 **in the tweet with more than 15.8 million views**, as mentioned above. And why are they not displayed? Due to a lack of consensus between contributors, who present ‚Äúdifferent points of view‚Äù according to the platform‚Äôs rules.

! <image:6468>

This is precisely one of the points to improve the X Community Notes system identified by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 [in its analysis](https://maldita.es/nosotros/20250117/notas-comunidad-verificadores-juntos-funcione/)
. One of the problems it raises is that many of the notes that are proposed and that refute viral misinformation are never shown to users. It also points against the need for consensus among users, who tend to disagree.¬†

Thus, several contexts have been identified in which community notes have not been sufficient to combat hoaxes. For example, [during the disinformation campaign](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20241127/dana-notas-comunidad-x-twitter/)
 that emerged on social networks as a result [of the DANA of October 2024](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241030/bulos-y-desinformaciones-sobre-el-paso-de-la-dana-en-el-este-y-sur-de-espana-en-octubre-de-2024/)
: out of 176 tweets analysed with disinformation narratives about heavy rains, only 8.5% had visible community notes. They were also not enough to stop the spread of the [hoax of the video of the European Parliament applauding the launch of missiles from Ukraine to Russia](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241125/parlamento-europeo-aplausos-misiles-ucrania/)
. This content was spread in at least [five different languages on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20241126/bulo-parlamento-europeo-misiles-europa/)
 and none of those analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 had community notes.

**61.9% of posts are from users with a blue tick, but that does not mean they are trustworthy**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A common factor detected in this analysis is that most of the accounts that have shared the narrative about USAID allegedly paying US celebrities to visit Ukraine in X **pay the premium version**. Of the 42 pieces of content analysed, **37 were published by users with the so-called** [**blue tick**](https://maldita.es/malditatecnologia/20230421/Twitter-tic-azul-original-cambios/)
 (61.9% of the total). In fact, among the ten most viral tweets, there is only one tweet that does not have the blue tick.

The blue tick is no longer synonymous with the fact that a profile is verified and is who it claims to be. Now, [this badge is obtained by paying a subscription](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20230331/tic-azul-twitter-blue-desinformacion-cuentas-verificadas/)
 fee, so anyone can access it. This change may give a false sense of security to the user viewing the content on their device.

**This disinformative narrative is circulated in at least nine languages within X**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contents that have had the greatest impact so far are those disseminated in English. Of the 42 analysed by [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
, **13 have been published in English.** In total, they have had more than 18.4 million views (an average of 1.4 million per publication).¬†

! <image:6472>

The **content in French**, meanwhile, has an average of **106,000 views per tweet**. The nine tweets taken into account for this analysis reach almost one million reproductions (958,821 views in total).¬†

Although to a lesser extent and with less impact, content in Portuguese, Spanish, German and Romanian was also found. Four publications in each of these languages were used in this analysis. Of this group, those published in Portuguese and Spanish have had the greatest reach (with an average of 61,000 and 44,000 reproductions, respectively). There were also three tweets in Italian (with 44,000 total views) and two in Polish (with a total of 11,765 views) and one in Dutch (with 20,100 views).

These 42 pieces of content do not reflect the full impact of the dissemination of this narrative. During the analysis, [Maldita.es](https://Maldita.es)
 **has located dozens of tweets** in localized languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith less than 5,000 views. In addition, this misinformation [has been shared on X](https://maldita.es/malditobulo/20250206/video-angelina-jolie-orlando-bloom-visita-ucrania/#:~:text=El%20v%C3%ADdeo%20ha%20sido%20compartido%20en%20Twitter%2C%20ahora%20X%2C%20por%20Donald%20Trump%20Junior%20o%20Elon%20Musk)
 by Elon Musk, the owner of the platform with 216.4 million followers, and Donald Trump Junior, son of the US president, with 14.2 million followers on this social network.

[Why you can trust Sky News](/info/policies-and-standards)

Hollywood star Ben Stiller has met Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling the actor-turned-leader: "You are my hero."

The US actor, 56, who has been meeting with refugees in **[Poland](https://news.sky.com/topic/poland-6132)
** and **[Ukraine](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
** since 18 June, shook hands with the wartime premier as they met in Kyiv.

**[UK would be 'right to prepare for war' - Ukraine war latest updates](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-news-live-war-russia-putin-eu-membership-12541713)
**

He told President Zelenskyy: "It's great honour for me. You are my hero. You quit a great acting career for this."

"Not so great as you," he replied.

But Stiller insisted: "What you have done, the way you rallied the country and for the world, it's really inspiring."

The actor spoke of his time visiting the war-torn country, and the devastation he had seen.

"I feel that it's hard to understand what's going on here if you haven't been here.

"We were talking about the actual impact of coming here. I just was in Irpin this morning, saw the level of destruction.

"You see it on TV, you see it on social media, it's something else to actually see it and feel it and then to talk to people. We have talked to a bunch of people."

**.

The pair discussed the difficulties keeping the war in Ukraine in the global public eye after so many months of fighting.

President Zelenskyy said: "It is not interesting to speak about the war every day for an audience, for different people, but for us it is very important.

"When people forget to speak about this influence and how to push Russia, it's very difficult."

Looking at Stiller, he added: "Thanks to people like you, we can do it."

As he visited eastern Europe, Stiller has released a video message urging global support for Ukrainian refugees and the 100 million refugees around the world.

In his message he said: "I'm here meeting people who've been impacted by the work and hearing how it's changed their lives.

"War and violence are devastating people all over the world. No one chooses to flee their home. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person."

Last week Stiller, who is a UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) goodwill ambassador, had flown to Rzeszow in southeastern Poland.

On Sunday he was also spotted walking in the western city of Lviv, which has come under attack by [**Russian**](https://news.sky.com/topic/russia-5803)
 forces during the months-long invasion but has remained relatively unscathed compared to the ferocious assaults in the east of the country.

On his Instagram page, Stiller said he was meeting families "whose lives have been torn apart by war and violence in [**Ukraine**](https://news.sky.com/topic/ukraine-6556)
".

He said millions of people have been forced to flee their homes, with more than 90% being women and children, following the invasion by President Vladimir Putin's troops.

Stiller added: "I'm here to learn, to share stories that illustrate the human impact of war and to amplify calls for solidarity.

"Everyone has the right to seek safety. Whoever. Wherever. Whenever."

In one image, he was photographed meeting workers from the UNHCR.

In another post, the Zoolander and Tropic Thunder star was pictured hugging two refugee children near the Medyka border in Poland.

Since the war began, a number of stars from the music and film industries have visited Ukraine and its neighbouring countries.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my hero,‚Äù [Ben Stiller](https://deadline.com/tag/ben-stiller/)
 told Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://deadline.com/tag/volodymyr-zelenskyy/)
 today on a visit to Kyiv. ‚ÄúYou gave up a great acting career for this,‚Äù the _Severance_ filmmaker joked with the former _Servant of the People_ star.

‚ÄúNot so great as you,‚Äù Zelenskyy responded with perfect comic timing to laughing UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Stiller.

Showing up in [Ukraine](https://deadline.com/tag/ukraine/)
 on World Refugee Day, Stiller is the latest in a procession of high-profile guests to the country since Vladimir Putin and Russia‚Äôs bloody invasion launched on February 24. Contributing billions in financial and weaponry support as well as leading NATO‚Äôs overall efforts, President [Joe Biden](https://deadline.com/tag/joe-biden/)
 has not yet shown up in Kyiv yet.

### Watch on Deadline

POTUS today said that is ‚Äúnot likely‚Äù he will go to Ukraine while in Europe later this week.

Speaking with reporters briefly on a wide range of topics this morning, Biden added that he did not want to ‚Äúcause more difficulty for Ukrainians‚Äù by swooping into Kyiv as other leaders and celebrities have over the past months. Still, having visited with Ukrainian refugees on a trip to Poland in March, Biden could be planning a surprise touch down in Kyiv as he travels in Germany and Spain in the coming days.

! <image:6481>

On the other hand, before meeting Zelenskyy on Monday, Stiller walked among the ruins of Irpin and talked to survivors of the Russian attacks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to see this destruction on TV or on social networks. Another thing is to see it all with your own eyes,‚Äù said the actor to Zelenskyy later in the duo‚Äôs sit-down. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot more shocking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you saw in Irpin is definitely dreadful,‚Äù the battle garbed Ukrainian leader told Stiller. ‚ÄúBut it is even worse to just imagine what is happening in the settlements that are still under temporary occupation in the east.‚Äù

Earlier, Stiller filmed a brief video for social media unveiling his trip, as you can see below:

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results contain images of wildfires in Los Angeles. One source ([Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/january-2025-los-angeles-wildfires-once-generation-events-now-happen-frequently)) shows an image of wildfires <image:6506>.

Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-los-angeles-wildfires-rage-2025-01-08/3TQRCJ3GGFNF5I6YEQ3524YLTE/)) published images of wildfires <image:6507>. Britannica.com ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Los-Angeles-wildfires-of-2025)) shows an image of a house on fire during the Los Angeles wildfires of 2025 <image:6508>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an image of a burned-down building near a beach and a road from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5259842) <image:6511>. The New York Times published an article about wildfires in Los Angeles on February 2, 2025, which is available at [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/02/us/la-wildfires-palisades-eaton-preparations.html) <image:6512>. Another source contains an image of a neighborhood destroyed by fire <image:6513> from [CFR](https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/after-fires-how-rebuild-los-angeles).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that wildfires occurred in Los Angeles in January 2025, causing significant damage to buildings and neighborhoods. However, the search results do not provide any information about the ownership of the destroyed properties.

The claim that eight mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down cannot be verified with the available evidence. The evidence does not mention the owners of the destroyed properties.

To verify the claim, information about the owners of the destroyed mansions is needed.

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‚Äç

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today‚Äôs horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn‚Äôt go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

‚ÄúWe appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today‚Äôs appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.‚Äù

Given names
-----------

East Slavic parents select a [given name](/wiki/Russian_personal_name "Russian personal name")
 for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

*   [Eastern Orthodox Church](/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
     tradition
*   [native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons](/wiki/Slavic_names "Slavic names")
    

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, [French](/wiki/French_name "French name")
, like _Jean-Luc_) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: _Mariya-Tereza_.

### Forms

Being highly [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
, the East Slavic ones treat personal names as [grammatical](/wiki/Grammatical "Grammatical")
 nouns and apply the same rules of [inflection](/wiki/Inflection "Inflection")
 and [derivation](/wiki/Derivation_(linguistics) "Derivation (linguistics)")
 to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name –ñ–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ _Zhanna_ can have the suffixes added directly to the stem –ñ–∞–Ω–Ω- _Zhann-_ like –ñ–∞–Ω–Ω**–æ—á–∫–∞** _Zhann**ochka**_), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª _Mikhail_ has the auxiliary stem –ú–∏—à- _Mish-_, which produces such name-forms as –ú–∏—à**–∞** _Mish**a**_, –ú–∏—à**–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞** _Mish**enka**_, –ú–∏—à**—É–Ω—è** _Mish**unya**_ etc., not \***–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª**—É—à–∫–∞ _**Mikhail**ushka_).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong [T‚ÄìV distinction](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction "T‚ÄìV distinction")
: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart's name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

| Name form | Example | Formation | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full | _–ê–Ω–Ω–∞_ (Anna) | full name stem + case ending | \-  |
| Short | _–ê–Ω**—è**_ (An**ya**) | short name stem + II declension ending | most common for informal communication, comparable to Western name-only form of address _(Ann, John)_, or Japanese surname-only, or _surname/name -kun_ |
| Diminutive | _–ê–Ω—å**–∫**–∞_ (An**k**a) | short name stem + -–∫- _\-k-_ + II declension ending | expresses familiarity, may be considered rude when used between people who are not close friends. Comparable to English diminutives _(Annie, Willy)_ or Japanese unsuffixed names |
| Affective diminutive | _–ê–Ω**–µ—á–∫**–∞_ (An**yechk**a) | short name stem + -–µ—á–∫/–æ—á–∫/–æ–Ω—å–∫/—É—Å—å/—é—Å—å/—É–ª—å/—é–ª—å- _\-echk/ochk/on'k/us/yus/ul/yul-_ + II declension ending | most intimate and affectionate form, comparable to German diminutives _(√Ñnnchen)_ or Japanese _\-chan_ suffixes |

#### Short forms

[Marina Tsvetaeva](/wiki/Marina_Tsvetaeva "Marina Tsvetaeva")
, a Russian poet. The name "Marina" traditionally has no short form.

's poem _[Ruslan and Ludmila](/wiki/Ruslan_and_Ludmila "Ruslan and Ludmila")
_. The short form for _–†—É—Å–ª–∞–Ω_ (Ruslan) is _–†—É—Å—è_ (Rusya).

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Mikola_II.jpg/250px-Mikola_II.jpg)](/wiki/File:Mikola_II.jpg)

–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π II ([Nicholas II](/wiki/Nicholas_II "Nicholas II")
), the last Russian emperor. In private, [his wife](/wiki/Alexandra_Feodorovna_(Alix_of_Hesse) "Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)")
 addressed him as Nicki, in the German manner, rather than _–ö–æ–ª—è_ (Kolya), which is the East Slavic short form of his name.

The "short name" (Russian: –∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–æ–µ –∏–º—è _kratkoye imya_), historically also "half-name" (Russian: –ø–æ–ª—É–∏–º—è _poluimya_), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced [suppletively](/wiki/Suppletion "Suppletion")
 and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: –°–∞—à–∞) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

#### Diminutive forms

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg/250px-Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Veruschka_Gr%C3%A4fin_von_Lehndorff_001.jpg)

[Veruschka](/wiki/Veruschka "Veruschka")
, a German model, actress and artist. "Veruschka" is the German spelling the [hypocoristic](/wiki/Hypocoristic "Hypocoristic")
 –í–µ—Ä—É—à–∫–∞ of her given name [Vera](/wiki/Vera_(given_name) "Vera (given name)")
.

Diminutive forms are produced from the "short name" by means of various suffixes; for example, –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª Mikhail (full) ‚Äì –ú–∏—à–∞ Misha (short) ‚Äì –ú–∏—à–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞ Mishenka (affectionate) ‚Äì –ú–∏—à–∫–∞ Mishka (colloquial). If no "short name" exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ Marina (full) ‚Äì –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—á–∫–∞ Marinochka (affectionate) ‚Äì –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∫–∞ Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

##### Affectionate diminutive

Typically formed by suffixes -_–µ–Ω—å–∫_\- (-yenk-), -_–æ–Ω—å–∫_\- (-onk-), -_–µ—á–∫_\- (-yechk-), -_—É—à–∫_ (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -_chen_, -_lein_, Japanese -_chan_ and -_tan_ and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

##### Colloquial diminutives

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -_–∫_\- ("-k-") suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -_—è–Ω_ (-yan), -_–æ–Ω_ (-on), and -_–æ–∫/—ë–∫_ (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of "male brotherhood" that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union.

Patronymics
-----------

The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English [middle name](/wiki/Middle_name "Middle name")
.

### Usage

The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names ‚Äì [Russian](/wiki/Russian_language "Russian language")
: –ú–∞—Ä—å—è –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞, –º–æ–≥—É —è —Å–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å..., [lit.](/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")‚Äâ'Marya Ivanovna, may I ask...'. Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.[\[2\]](#cite_note-3)

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.[\[3\]](#cite_note-4)

In speech patronymics are commonly truncated and it is not considered to be a colloquialism, e.g., written "Ivan Ivanovich" may be pronounced "as is", as well as "Ivan Ivanych".[\[4\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-6)

In the past of [East Slavs](/wiki/East_Slavs "East Slavs")
, before the introduction of surnames, noble, wealthy, or otherwise respected people were addressed by name plus patronymic, see, e.g., "[Yaroslavich](/wiki/Yaroslavich "Yaroslavich")
"/"[Yaroslavna](/wiki/Yaroslavna "Yaroslavna")
". From this custom a number of surnames of [West Ruthenian](/wiki/Ruthenians "Ruthenians")
 origin was produced, such as [Antonovich](/wiki/Antonovich "Antonovich")
 or [Prokopovich](/wiki/Prokopovich "Prokopovich")
, which in their turn derived [Polish surnames](/wiki/Polish_surnames "Polish surnames")
, such as [Antonowicz](/wiki/Antonowicz "Antonowicz")
 or [Prokopowicz](/wiki/Prokopowicz "Prokopowicz")
 (the Ruthenian origin is recognized by the suffix _\-wicz_: the corresponding native (now archaic) Polish suffix was '-wic': [Szymonowic](/wiki/Szymonowic "Szymonowic")
, [Klonowic](/wiki/Klonowic "Klonowic")
).[\[6\]](#cite_note-7)

For commoners, when the distinction among people with the same given name was required, a qualifier "son of..." was usually added: "–ò–≤–∞—à–∫–∞, –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤ —Å—ã–Ω" ("Ivashka, Antonov syn", i.e., 'Ivashka, son of Anton'). From the latter tradition Russian [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
 ending in "-ov/-ev/yov" originated, in this case, [Antonov](/wiki/Antonov_(surname) "Antonov (surname)")
".

### Derivation

| Name | Masculine patronym | Feminine patronym |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anatoly | Anatolyevich | Anatolyevna |
| Constantin | Constantinovich | Constantinovna |
| Dmitry | Dmitriyevich | Dmitriyevna |
| Ilya | Ilyich | Ilyinichna |
| Ivan | Ivanovich | Ivanovna |
| Nikolay | Nikolayevich | Nikolayevna |
| Vladimir | Vladimirovich | Vladimirovna |
| Yakov | Yakovlevich | Yakovlevna |

The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father's name and suffixes. The suffix is -_–æ–≤–∏—á_ (-ovich) for a son, -_–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ (-ovna) ‚Äì for a daughter. For example, if the father's name was _–ò–≤–∞–Ω_ (Ivan), the patronymic will be _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á_ (Ivanovich) for a son and _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a _–π_ ("y") or a soft [consonant](/wiki/Consonant "Consonant")
, the initial _o_ in the suffixes -_–æ–≤–∏—á_ (-ovich) and -_–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ (-ovna) becomes a _–µ_ ("ye") and the suffixes change to -_–µ–≤–∏—á_ (-yevich) and -_–µ–≤–Ω–∞_ (-yevna). For example, if the father is _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π_ (Dmitry), the patronymic is _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–∏—á_ (Dmitrievich) for a son and _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–Ω–∞_ (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á_ (Dmitrovich) or _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ (Dmitrovna) because the name _–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π_ (Dmitry) ends on "–π" ("y");

For some names ending in a [vowel](/wiki/Vowel "Vowel")
, the suffix is -_–∏—á_ (-ich) for a son and -_–∏—á–Ω–∞_ (-ichna) or -_–∏–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞_ (-inichna) for a daughter; for example, –§–æ–∫–∞ Foka (father's first name) ‚Äì –§–æ–∫–∏—á Fokich (male patronymic) ‚Äì –§–æ–∫–∏—á–Ω–∞ Fokichna (female patronymic); –ö—É–∑—å–º–∞ Kuzma (father's first name) ‚Äì –ö—É–∑—å–º–∏—á Kuzmich (male patronymic) ‚Äì –ö—É–∑—å–º–∏–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞ Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

### Historical grounds

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Rurikname.JPG/250px-Rurikname.JPG)](/wiki/File:Rurikname.JPG)

The name [Rurik](/wiki/Rurik "Rurik")
 on a [Viking Age](/wiki/Viking_Age "Viking Age")
 runestone. All the princes of [Kievan Rus](/wiki/Kievan_Rus "Kievan Rus")
 had the patronymic [Ruerikovichi](/wiki/Rurikids "Rurikids")
.

Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person's name included that of their father: e.g. _–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ —Å—ã–Ω_ (Ivan Petrov syn) which means "Ivan, son of Peter". That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (–†—é—Ä–∏–∫–æ**–≤–∏—á**–∏, [Rueriko**vich**i, Rurikids](/wiki/Rurik_dynasty "Rurik dynasty")
, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German _von_. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -_–æ–≤–∏—á_ (-_ovich_) was the privilege given by the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
 to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar [Vasili IV](/wiki/Vasili_IV_of_Russia "Vasili IV of Russia")
 gave to the [Stroganovs](/wiki/Stroganov_family "Stroganov family")
, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -_ovich_. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, "... _to write him with_ ovich_, to try_ \[him\] _in Moscow only, not to fee_ \[him\] _by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself_ \[which means not to swear during any processions\]"[\[7\]](#cite_note-8)
 In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

### Legal basis

Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary,[\[8\]](#cite_note-9)
 such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

### Matronymic

In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother's name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.[\[9\]](#cite_note-10)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-11)

Family names

[Family names](/wiki/Family_name "Family name")
 are generally used like in English.

In Russian, some common suffixes are -_–æ–≤_ (-ov), -_–µ–≤_ (-yev), meaning "belonging to" or "of the clan of/descendant of", e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for [patronymic surnames](/wiki/Patronymic_surname "Patronymic surname")
‚Äîor -_—Å–∫–∏–π_ (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning "associated with" and usually used for [toponymic surnames](/wiki/Toponymic_surname "Toponymic surname")
. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname [Shuysky](/wiki/Shuysky "Shuysky")
 is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of [Shuya](/wiki/Shuya_(inhabited_locality) "Shuya (inhabited locality)")
. Prince [Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin](/wiki/Grigory_Potemkin "Grigory Potemkin")
\-Tavricheski had the [victory title](/wiki/Victory_title "Victory title")
 'Tavricheski', as part of his surname, granted to him for the [annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire](/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Empire "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire")
.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, _\-off_ was a common transliteration of _\-ov_ for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the [Smirnoff](/wiki/Smirnoff "Smirnoff")
 and the [Davidoff](/wiki/Davidoff "Davidoff")
 brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -–∫–æ (-ko), -—É–∫ (-uk), and -–∏—á (-ych). For example, the family name _–ü–∏—Å–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ_ ([Pisarenko](/wiki/Pisarenko "Pisarenko")
) is derived from the word for a scribe, and _–ö–æ–≤–∞–ª—å—á—É–∫_ ([Kovalchuk](/wiki/Kovalchuk "Kovalchuk")
) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

[Hyphenated surnames](/wiki/Hyphenated_surname "Hyphenated surname")
 like [Petrov-Vodkin](/wiki/Petrov-Vodkin "Petrov-Vodkin")
 are possible.

### Grammar

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg/250px-Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Lesser_CoA_of_the_emperor_of_Russia.svg)

The Coat of Arms of the _–†–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤—ã_ ([Romanovs](/wiki/Romanovs "Romanovs")
), the last Russian royal dynasty. The family name _–†–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤_ (Romanov) means "pertaining to (the name) Roman".

East Slavic languages are [synthetic languages](/wiki/Synthetic_languages "Synthetic languages")
 and have [grammatical cases](/wiki/Grammatical_cases "Grammatical cases")
 and [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
. Unlike [analytic languages](/wiki/Analytic_language "Analytic language")
 like English, which use prepositions ("to", "at", "on" etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, East Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (_\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_) or full (_\-iy/-oy/-yy_) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms _\-ov_, _\-ev_, _\-in_ and _\-iy/-oy/-yy_ correspond to female forms _\-ova_, _\-eva_, _\-ina_ and _\-aya_, respectively. For example, the wife of _–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω_ (Boris Yel'tsin) was _–ù–∞–∏–Ω–∞ –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω**–∞**_ (Naina Yel'tsin**a**); the wife of [Leo Tolst**oy**](/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy "Leo Tolstoy")
 was [Sophia Tolst**aya**](/wiki/Sophia_Tolstaya "Sophia Tolstaya")
, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -_–µ–Ω–∫–æ_ (_\-yenko_), -_–∏—á_ (_\-ich_) etc.), unlike in many [West Slavic languages](/wiki/West_Slavic_languages "West Slavic languages")
, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Nov√°k ‚Üí Nov√°kov√°). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with _\-ich_: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov_ich_ Mirov_ich_ and Anna Petr_ovna_ Mirov_ich_)

This dependence of [grammatical gender](/wiki/Grammatical_gender "Grammatical gender")
 of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in [Polish](/wiki/Polish_name "Polish name")
, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤_ (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

| Grammatical  <br>case | Example of question | Masculine form |     | Feminine form |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyrillic | Latin | Cyrillic | Latin |
| [Nominative](/wiki/Nominative_case "Nominative case") | Who? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤_ | Ivanov | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞_ | Ivanova |
| [Genitive](/wiki/Genitive_case "Genitive case") | Whose? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–∞**_ | Ivano**va** | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–æ–π**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Dative](/wiki/Dative_case "Dative case") | To whom? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤—É**_ | Ivano**vu** | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–æ–π**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Accusative](/wiki/Accusative_case "Accusative case") | Whom? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–∞**_ | Ivano**va** | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤—É**_ | Ivano**vu** |
| [Instrumental](/wiki/Instrumental_case "Instrumental case") | By whom? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤—ã–º**_ | Ivano**vym** | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–æ–π**_ | Ivano**voy** |
| [Locative](/wiki/Locative_case "Locative case")<br> (Prepositional) | About whom? | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–µ**_ | Ivano**ve** | _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ**–≤–æ–π**_ | Ivano**voy** |

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (_Zhuk_, _Gogol_, _Barchuk_, _Kupala_ etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case ("to whom?") would be: –ò–≤–∞–Ω**—É** –ñ—É–∫**—É** (_Ivan**u**_ _Zhuk**u**_), but –ê–Ω–Ω**–µ** –ñ—É–∫ (_Ann**e** Zhuk_).

Family names are generally inherited from one's parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

Slavicisation of foreign names
------------------------------

### Slavicisation of foreign surnames

See also: [Azerbaijanization of surnames](/wiki/Azerbaijanization_of_surnames "Azerbaijanization of surnames")

Some surnames in those languages have been [russified](/wiki/Russification "Russification")
 since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former [president](/wiki/President_(government_title) "President (government title)")
 [Nursultan Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
 has a Russian "-yev" [suffix](/wiki/Suffix "Suffix")
, which literally means "of Nazar-bay" (in which "bay" is a Turkic native [noble](/wiki/Nobility "Nobility")
 [rank](/wiki/Ranks_of_nobility_and_peerage "Ranks of nobility and peerage")
: compare [Turkish](/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people")
 "[bey](/wiki/Bey "Bey")
", [Uzbek](/wiki/Uzbeks "Uzbeks")
 "boy" "bek", and [Kyrghyz](/wiki/Kyrgyz_people "Kyrgyz people")
 "bek"). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of [Azerbaijan](/wiki/Azerbaijan "Azerbaijan")
 into the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as _\-yev_ or _\-ov_ for men and _\-yeva_ or _\-ova_ for women.[\[11\]](#cite_note-12)
 Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are [Aliyev](/wiki/Aliyev "Aliyev")
, [Huseynov](/wiki/Huseynov "Huseynov")
, and [Mammadov](/wiki/Mammadov "Mammadov")
.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in [Uzbekistan](/wiki/Uzbekistan "Uzbekistan")
.[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are [Rashidov](/wiki/Rashidov "Rashidov")
, [Beknazarov](/wiki/Beknazarov "Beknazarov")
 and [Abdullaev](/wiki/Abdullaev "Abdullaev")
. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

### Slavicisation of foreign patronymics

By law, foreign persons who adopt [Russian citizenship](/wiki/Russian_citizenship "Russian citizenship")
 are allowed to have no patronymic.[\[13\]](#cite_note-14)
 Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician [Irina Hakamada](/wiki/Irina_Hakamada "Irina Hakamada")
's patronym is _–ú—É—Ü—É–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ (Mutsuovna) because her [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese_name "Japanese name")
 father's given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are [Kazakh](/wiki/Kazakh_language "Kazakh language")
 _“±–ª—ã_ (_uly_; transcribed into Latin script as _\-uly_, as in [Nursultan Abish**uly** Nazarbayev](/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev "Nursultan Nazarbayev")
), or [Azeri](/wiki/Patronymic#Azeri "Patronymic")
 _–æ–≥–ª—ã/–æ“ì–ª—É_ (_oglu_) (as in [Heydar Alirza **oglu** Aliyev](/wiki/Heydar_Aliyev "Heydar Aliyev")
); Kazakh _“õ—ã–∑—ã_ (transcribed into Latin script as -_qyzy_, as in [Dariga Nursultan**qyzy** Nazarbayeva](/wiki/Dariga_Nazarbayeva "Dariga Nazarbayeva")
).\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\] Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

[Bruno Pontecorvo](/wiki/Bruno_Pontecorvo "Bruno Pontecorvo")
, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as _–ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫–æ—Ä–≤–æ_ (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father's given name was _Massimo_ (corresponding to Russian –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names _–î–∂–∏–ª—å –ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫–æ—Ä–≤–æ_ (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), _–ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–æ –ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫–æ—Ä–≤–æ_ (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and _–¢–∏—Ç–æ –ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫–æ—Ä–≤–æ_ (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

Forms of address
----------------

### Common rules

*   For informal communication, only the first name is used: –ò–≤–∞–Ω Ivan. Even more informally, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutives "Diminutives")
     (several can be formed from one name) are often used.
*   In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (_–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á_ Petrovich, _–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∞_ Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the "ty" form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*   The family name alone (_–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤_, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
*   the form "first name + patronymic" (for instance, _–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á_, Ivan Ivanovich):
    *   is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of "first name + patronymic" only);
    *   may convey the speaker's respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (–†—é—Ä–∏–∫–æ**–≤–∏—á**–∏, [Rueriko**vich**i](/wiki/Rurikovich "Rurikovich")
        )
*   The full three-name form (for instance, _–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤_ Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (_–ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á_, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, [diminutives](/wiki/Diminutive "Diminutive")
 of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: [Stenka Razin](/wiki/Stenka_Razin "Stenka Razin")
, [Grishka Rasputin](/wiki/Grishka_Rasputin "Grishka Rasputin")
, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the [tsar](/wiki/Tsar "Tsar")
.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the [choice of second-person pronoun](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Russian "T‚ÄìV distinction")
. Russian language distinguishes:

*   formal _–≤—ã_ (vy, "you"); respectful _–í—ã_ ("Vy", "You") may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural _–≤—ã_ ("vy", "you") is not.
*   informal _—Ç—ã_ (ty, "you", "thou" in old English);

_–í—ã_ ("Vy") is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under [Peter the Great](/wiki/Peter_the_Great "Peter the Great")
, which uses [_du_ and _Sie_](/wiki/T%E2%80%93V_distinction#Sie_and_du "T‚ÄìV distinction")
 similarly.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\
_\]

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

| Vy or ty | Form | Male example | Female example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Using "Vy" | Full three-name form | Anatoliy Pavlovich Ivanov | Varvara Mikhailovna Kuznetsova | Official documents, very formal occasions (when necessary) |
| First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | General formal or respectful form |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Formal. Often used by a person of a higher social position (like a teacher talking to a student) |
| Informal first name + informal patronymic | Tol' Palych | Varvara Mikhalna | Respectful but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara |
| Diminutive first name | Tolya | Varya | Friendly but still somewhat formal |
| Affectionate first name |     | Varechka | Used almost exclusively towards women, showing fondness but still keeping some formality (like to a younger colleague) |
| Using "Ty" | First name + patronymic | Anatoliy Pavlovich | Varvara Mikhailovna | Can be used between friends on semi-formal occasions or ironically |
| Informal patronymic | Palych | Mikhalna | Combining familiarity and respect |
| Surname | Ivanov | Kuznetsova | Similar in use to a "vy" form but less formal |
| Full first name | Anatoliy | Varvara | Friendly but with a tone of formality. If the name has no diminutive form (Yegor), also used informally |
| Diminutive first name | Tolia | Varya | General informal form |
| Colloquial first name | Tolik | Var'ka | Very familiar form |
| Slang first name | Tolyan | Varyukha |
| Affectionate first name | Tolen'ka | Varechka | Tender, affectionate form |

Using a "ty" form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

### Adjectives

Other East Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All East Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like _–õ—é–±–∏–º—ã–π / –õ—é–±–∏–º–∞—è_ (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, "beloved") and _–ú–∏–ª—ã–π / –ú–∏–ª–∞—è_ (miliy / milaya, "sweetheart") are informal, and _–£–≤–∞–∂–∞–µ–º—ã–π / –£–≤–∞–∂–∞–µ–º–∞—è_ (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally "respected") is highly formal. Some adjectives, like _–î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ–π / –î–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∞—è_ (dorogoy / dorogaya, "dear"), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

**Russian internal passport number format**
-------------------------------------------

These details will tell you how to read a Passport series and number Russian. The series and passport number are recorded in the format XX XX YYYYYY, where XX XX is the 4-digit passport series and YYYYYY is the 6-digit passport number.

Now you know how many digits does a Russian passport have

![numbers in russia internal passport series number and id number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20137'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number example

The first two digits of the passport series correspond to the OKATO code of the region in which the passport was issued; the third and fourth digits of the passport series correspond to the last two digits of the year of issue of the passport form (deviation of 1-3 years is allowed).

What is a series and passport number of a citizen of the Russian Federation? This is an original 10-digit numeric combination. Without looking closely, you can see that there is a small gap between the first four digits and the next six, which distinguishes the series from the number. The first four numerical values are a series of the document, and the remaining six are its number.

If you look closely, the first 4 digits are also pairwise separated from each other, for example, 52 17. The first pair number allows you to find out in which area the citizen received his document.

The digital code in the document allows you to distinguish one document from another. A single surname and name would not be enough, since many people with the same surname, name and date of birth can live in the Russian Federation.

In such a situation, only a given numerical code helps to distinguish one citizen from another. After all, the chance that two citizens have a numerical code will be identical is zero.

If you enter these values in a special database, then the result will be all the information about the person (his name, information about marriage, children, etc.).

**Russian passport number sample**
----------------------------------

Passport number Russia

![Russia passport number sample](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%2087'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russia passport number

Example Russian passport serial number: a passport of a series 45 04 was issued in the city of Moscow, and a passport of a series 37 11 was issued in the Kurgan region in 2011.

For example, if the beginning of the ten-digit code contains the number 52, this means that the document was received in the Nizhny Novgorod region. After the first two-digit number follows the second, which means the year of issue.

From example 52-17 it can be understood that the passport was issued in 2017.

Attention! Sometimes the second number does not coincide with the year of issue, that is, instead of 17 it may be 16 or 18. There is an explanation for this.

This can happen when the issued forms for 2017 ended, and in the passport office began to use forms for the next, 2018. Or vice versa, the year 2016 has passed, and the forms remained on it.

Therefore, if the second two-digit number does not coincide with the year of issue, there is nothing criminal in it.

![Russian passport ID number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20607'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport number format

The photo shows the second and third pages of the passport of a person who is a citizen of Russia. On the right vertically along the entire length of the pages of the document, a series and a number are printed in red font. Russian passport ID number

The first numerical value, consisting of 2 digits ‚Äì 39, means the area in which the citizen received the document. In the situation presented in the photo above, the document was issued in the Kaliningrad region.

Let‚Äôs look at another example with a different arrangement of partially original code of Russian passport series and number.

![Russian passport series and number](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20636'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Russian passport series and number

On the page on the lower right, you can clearly see numbers from small punctures. Everything is similar here, only spaces between numerical values are less noticeable than in the first example.

The last six digits are the serial number in the state database.

Based on this, we can conclude that the first 4 digits of many citizens of the Russian Federation can be identical. But the next six digits of all people are absolutely unique.

The image in the claim, <image:21>, appears in a Wikipedia article about East Slavic names ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)) and a Wikimedia Commons file ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)) showing a Russian passport. The image also appears on a website discussing Russian internal passports ([https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/](https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is of a Russian passport. The image appears in a Wikipedia article about East Slavic names and on websites discussing Russian internal passports. However, the evidence does not confirm that the passport belongs to Bashar al-Assad or that it is authentic.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Poland held military parades, including one on August 15, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the parade was on August 14, 2024, or that it was preparing for war with Russia.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is inaccurate. While Poland did hold a military parade, the evidence suggests it occurred on August 15, 2024, not August 14, 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the assertion that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia. Sources like [KSAT](https://www.ksat.com/news/world/2024/08/15/poland-showcases-its-growing-army-on-a-holiday-that-celebrates-its-historic-defeat-of-the-red-army/) and [Militarnyi.com](https://militarnyi.com/en/news/a-large-scale-parade-dedicated-to-the-day-of-the-polish-army-took-place-in-poland/) confirm the parade but do not mention the date or the war preparation.
