The claim 'In March 2025 podcaster and UFC commentator Joe Rogan said, 'I don't go to Canada anymore,' then added, 'I'd rather go to Russia.'' is false.
Justification: Joe Rogan did state he would rather go to Russia than Canada, as reported by multiple news outlets, including [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-canada-ufc-russia-2049964), [Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/11098769/joe-rogan-rather-go-to-russia-than-canada-ufc/), and the [Toronto Sun](https://torontosun.com/sports/mma/joe-rogan-would-rather-go-to-russia-than-ufc-event-in-canada-i-wont-be-there). However, the exact context and date of the statement are not entirely accurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
