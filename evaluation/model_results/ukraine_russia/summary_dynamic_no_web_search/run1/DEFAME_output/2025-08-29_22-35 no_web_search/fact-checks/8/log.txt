Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-provide-ukraine-humanitarian-aid-praises-russia-ties-2022-03-07/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on March 7, 2022, about China providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The article includes an image of Wang Yi, China's Foreign Minister, wearing a mask with the Chinese flag on it. <image:6171>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. Multiple image searches did not yield any results that corroborate the claim that the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops were deployed to aid Russia in Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
