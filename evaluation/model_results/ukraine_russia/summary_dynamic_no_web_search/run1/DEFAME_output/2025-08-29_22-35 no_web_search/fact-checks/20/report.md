The search results include an image of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5467272/russia-ukraine-war-trump-nato-weapons-tariffs) ![image 6203](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507142-049227.jpg) and an image of Donald Trump from [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-launches-136-drones-ukraine-ahead-expected-trump/story?id=123729140) ![image 6204](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507144-128563.jpg).


## Elaboration
The search results provide images of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump, but they do not contain any information about Rutte's alleged statement regarding Trump, Ukraine, and NATO.

I need more information to verify the claim. Specifically, I need a source that quotes Mark Rutte making the statement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Mark Rutte and Donald Trump from [Politico](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/07/trump-sends-weapons-ukraine-pro-00451109) ![image 6218](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507173-212105.jpg) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/davos-nato-chief-rutte-reaffirms-need-step-up-support-ukraine-2025-01-23/) ![image 6219](media/2025-08-29_22-39-1756507174-154632.jpg). The Reuters article, published on January 23, 2025, discusses Rutte's reaffirmation of the need to support Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about the alleged statement by Mark Rutte. The search results provide images of Rutte and Trump, but they do not include the quote in question. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results did not provide any evidence to support the claim that Mark Rutte made the statement attributed to him. The search results included images of Rutte and Trump, but no quotes or articles confirming the statement.

`false`
