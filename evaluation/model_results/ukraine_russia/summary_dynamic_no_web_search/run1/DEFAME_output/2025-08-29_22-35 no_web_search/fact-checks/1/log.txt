The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest, or Kehlsteinhaus, in Berchtesgaden in the southern German state of Bavaria, for 14.2 million euros.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest is false. A fact-check article explicitly states that Zelenskyy did not purchase the property, which remains under the ownership of the Bavarian state ([Source](https://cedmohub.eu/no-zelensky-hasnt-bought-eagles-nest-it-is-still-in-ownership-of-bavarian-state/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
