No new actions were found in this response:
```
image_search("Russia Ukraine war casualties February 2025")
``` and performed actions: image_search("Russia Ukraine war casualties February 2025"), image_search("Russia Ukraine war troop losses February 2025"), image_search("Russian troop losses Ukraine war February 2025")
The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including maps and articles from various sources like Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/3/highest-price-for-war-russia-lost-430000-soldiers-in-2024-says-ukraine)), does not support the claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025. While Al Jazeera reports 430,000 losses in 2024, this figure does not align with the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
