## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a claim about Netanyahu proposing to resettle Gaza residents to Ukraine and Syria has been labeled as "FAKE" by StopFake.org ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)). The additional search results show images of Netanyahu at the White House, but they do not provide any information to support the claim.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is likely false.
