The claim 'Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires from January 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while there were California wildfires in January 2025, and Russia was involved in exploiting the situation, there is no evidence to support the claim that Russia offered assistance for the wildfires. The search results show a Russian official offering shelter to victims, but not direct assistance for the fires. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
