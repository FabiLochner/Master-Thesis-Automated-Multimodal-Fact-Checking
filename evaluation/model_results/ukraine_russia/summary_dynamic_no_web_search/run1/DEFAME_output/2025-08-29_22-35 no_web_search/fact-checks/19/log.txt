The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the G20 summit did take place in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, and Giorgia Meloni attended, there is no evidence in the provided sources to support the assertion that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the summit.

So, the overall veracity is: false
