Useful result: From [Source](https://english.nv.ua/nation/russia-s-losses-in-the-war-against-ukraine-3-179-russian-tanks-since-the-beginning-of-the-year-50464063.html):

The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image shows destroyed tanks, the provided sources do not confirm the specific context of the claim, including the location (Kursk Oblast) and the date (August 2024). The search results show images of destroyed tanks from the Russia-Ukraine war, but not the one in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
