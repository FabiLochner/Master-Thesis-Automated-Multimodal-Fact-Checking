# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.

SummarizeDocPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia."

## Actions
```
image_search("United States military aid Ukraine Russia war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/13/biden-announces-additional-800m-us-military-aid-to-ukraine): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on April 13, 2022, about the United States announcing an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. <image:6231>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.


## Actions
```
image_search("US military aid to Ukraine February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on February 17, 2025, discussing the potential impact of withdrawing U.S. military aid from Ukraine (<image:6234>). Le Monde published an article on March 11, 2025, about the U.S. lifting the pause on intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine (<image:6236>).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes articles from February and March 2025, discussing U.S. military aid to Ukraine. However, the evidence does not specify the amount of aid provided.

The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The provided evidence does not confirm or deny this amount.

To verify the claim, I would need to find the exact amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.


## Actions
```
image_search("US military aid to Ukraine total amount February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-analysis-economists-ukraine-cost-us-aid-ukraine-less-half-official-figures): 
Content: The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) published an article. The article includes a graph showing the depreciated value of Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers produced each year from 2011 to 2024. <image:6242>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes a graph showing the depreciated value of Stryker Armored Personnel Carriers produced each year from 2011 to 2024. This information is not sufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. The provided evidence does not mention the total amount of military aid.

To verify the claim, I would need to find the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide information about U.S. military aid to Ukraine, including announcements and discussions about aid, but they do not specify the total amount of aid provided as of February 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence does not contain the specific amount of military aid the United States provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. While the search results mention U.S. aid and related discussions, they lack the necessary data to confirm the claim of $350 billion. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), has no content. The second source, from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/exclusive-wife-of-ukraine-president-elect-got-penthouse-bargain-from-tycoon-idUSKCN1S81TE/), contains an image of a building <image:6251>. The third source, from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/oceanfront-florida-mansion-whose-ownership-184443105.html), contains images of a Florida mansion <image:6252>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>). Sky News shows a plane landing in the UK, possibly belonging to Zelenskyy (<image:6263>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.

* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million."

## Actions
```

image_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy bank account")
image_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy private planes")
image_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy income")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), has no content. The second source, from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/exclusive-wife-of-ukraine-president-elect-got-penthouse-bargain-from-tycoon-idUSKCN1S81TE/), contains an image of a building <image:6251>. The third source, from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/oceanfront-florida-mansion-whose-ownership-184443105.html), contains images of a Florida mansion <image:6252>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>). Sky News shows a plane landing in the UK, possibly belonging to Zelenskyy (<image:6263>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy): 
Content: The Guardian published an article in October 2021 about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offshore connections. <image:6272>


## Elaboration
The evidence from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy)) mentions Zelenskyy's offshore connections, which could be related to the claim about his bank account. However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that while there is some information available about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's assets, such as his offshore connections and income, the provided evidence is insufficient to verify the specific details of the claim. The search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership or the number of homes and planes. The claim about the bank account and monthly income cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), has no content. The second source, from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/exclusive-wife-of-ukraine-president-elect-got-penthouse-bargain-from-tycoon-idUSKCN1S81TE/), contains an image of a building <image:6251>. The third source, from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/oceanfront-florida-mansion-whose-ownership-184443105.html), contains images of a Florida mansion <image:6252>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>). Sky News shows a plane landing in the UK, possibly belonging to Zelenskyy (<image:6263>).

The sources are: [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyys-trip-washington-treated-mini-state-visit-sources/story?id=95658338), [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-14/ukraine-zelenskyy-makes-surprise-paris-visit-talks-with-macron/102344976), and [https://news.sky.com/video/volodymyr-zelenskyys-plane-lands-in-uk-ahead-of-major-summit-in-london-13319190](https://news.sky.com/video/volodymyr-zelenskyys-plane-lands-in-uk-ahead-of-major-summit-in-london-13319190).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

## Elaboration
The evidence from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/03/revealed-anti-oligarch-ukrainian-president-offshore-connections-volodymyr-zelenskiy)) mentions Zelenskyy's offshore connections, which could be related to the claim about his bank account. However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.


## Actions

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence is still insufficient to verify the claim. The Financial Times article provides an image of Zelenskyy, but no information about his property, financial assets, or income. The claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific details about Zelenskyy's assets.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

One source from WHYY.org ([Source](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pauses-aid-ukraine-russia-war/)) contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6428>. Another source from CFR.org ([Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-trump-could-make-good-deal-end-ukraine-war)) also contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6429>.

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)) published an article on February 19, 2025, stating that Trump said he would probably meet Putin that month <image:6430>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms a phone call between Trump and Putin on February 12, 2025, and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Since the claim is not fully supported by the evidence, and additional information is needed to confirm the announcement of an agreement, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to Donald Trump and the war in Ukraine. One source from WHYY.org ([Source](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pauses-aid-ukraine-russia-war/)) contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6428>. Another source from CFR.org ([Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-trump-could-make-good-deal-end-ukraine-war)) also contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6429>.

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)) published an article on February 19, 2025, stating that Trump said he would probably meet Putin that month <image:6430>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.

The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.

## Elaboration
The new evidence from Al Jazeera, dated February 26, 2025, reports that Trump mentioned a "very big deal" involving Ukraine's Zelenskyy regarding rare earths. This does not confirm that Trump announced an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on February 12, 2025, as the claim states.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes a map showing military routes and bases in the area of Japan, Korea, and Russia, and another map showing Chinese and Russian warships near Japan. This suggests military activity in the region, but it does not confirm any invasion plans.

The presence of military assets and routes does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is needed.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes a map showing military routes and bases in the area of Japan, Korea, and Russia, and another map showing Chinese and Russian warships near Japan. This suggests military activity in the region, but it does not confirm any invasion plans.

The presence of military assets and routes does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is needed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows the presence of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia, and a historical map of the Russo-Japanese War. This suggests military activity and historical conflict in the region, but it does not confirm any current invasion plans.

The Financial Times map shows the location of Chinese navy ships, which could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic positioning. However, this does not directly imply an invasion plan. The Britannica map provides historical context, but it is not relevant to the current claim.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The presence of military assets and routes does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is needed.

## Elaboration
The evidence shows the presence of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia, and a historical map of the Russo-Japanese War. This suggests military activity and historical conflict in the region, but it does not confirm any current invasion plans.

The Financial Times map shows the location of Chinese navy ships, which could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic positioning. However, this does not directly imply an invasion plan. The Britannica map provides historical context, but it is not relevant to the current claim.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)
.

  

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Многие российские военные попали в засаду.

При бегстве из Балаклеи в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети, сообщает [«Апостроф»](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/rasplata-za-ilovaysk-okkupantyi-ponesli-ogromnyie-poteri-pri-begstve-iz-balaklei-video/278880/)

Российские войска бегут под натиском ВСУ: мнение экспертов и российских военных

![ОСТАТКИ РОССИЙСКОГО ТАНКА В БАЛАКЛЕЕ ХАРЬКОВСКОЙ ОБЛАСТИ. ФОТО: JUAN BARRETO / AFP / SCANPIX / LETA](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

‎Всего за несколько дней с начала контрнаступления украинской армии удалось освободить более 30 населенных пунктов Харьковской области, [объявил](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/3190)
 президент Украины Владимир Зеленский 9 сентября. На следующий день появились сообщения о том, что украинские войска вошли в Купянск, оккупированный российскими войсками в начале войны, об этом [рассказала](https://www.facebook.com/popova.natali/posts/pfbid0zaYm5vKnHk3gzPxJTwZeCWc2srUk9ksF517syxzGiC6UZEQA27TKxhSDtkXjHXkMl)

Синим цветом обозначены территории, освобожденные за последние две недели, зеленым — освобожденные ранее территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

The image shows individuals wearing patches of the American flag. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the location or the date of the event. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim is based on the presence of the American flag patches, which suggests the involvement of Americans. However, without additional information about the context, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the location, date, and the identity of the individuals in the image.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine launched an offensive in Kursk Oblast in August 2024. The Institute for the Study of War and Al Jazeera reported on the incursion, providing maps and details about the situation.

Therefore, while the evidence supports the timeframe and location mentioned in the claim, it does not provide any information to verify the presence of American mercenaries.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that patches combining the American and Ukrainian flags are available for sale. This suggests that the presence of an American flag patch does not necessarily indicate the involvement of American mercenaries.

The image search results show that such patches are commercially available. This information weakens the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries, as the patches could be worn by anyone.

Without further evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim.

## Actions
```
image_search("American flag patch Ukraine military")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results show patches that combine the American and Ukrainian flags. One source is from Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Bluyellow-American-Embroidered-Military-Backpacks/dp/B0CG28DJVD](https://www.amazon.com/Bluyellow-American-Embroidered-Military-Backpacks/dp/B0CG28DJVD)), and another is from Etsy ([https://www.etsy.com/listing/4303814651/2pcs-ukraine-american-flag-patch](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4303814651/2pcs-ukraine-american-flag-patch)). <image:6622>, <image:6624>

## Elaboration
The evidence shows that patches combining the American and Ukrainian flags are available for sale. This suggests that the presence of an American flag patch does not necessarily indicate the involvement of American mercenaries.

The image search results show that such patches are commercially available. This information weakens the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries, as the patches could be worn by anyone.

Without further evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim.
