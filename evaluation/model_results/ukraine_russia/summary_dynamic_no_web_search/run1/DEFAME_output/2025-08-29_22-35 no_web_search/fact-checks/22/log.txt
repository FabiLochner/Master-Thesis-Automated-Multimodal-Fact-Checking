Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-concerned-ukraines-kursk-assault-russia-prepares-counterattack/story?id=113022137): 
Content: ABC News published an article about the Kursk offensive, including an image of an explosion. <image:6266>

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was an offensive in the Kursk region in August 2024, as reported by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-10-2024) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/8/13/russia-ukraine-live-news-russia-hits-back-at-ukrainian-forces-in-kursk), there is no evidence to suggest that the image depicts a chemical attack by Ukrainian forces.

So, the overall veracity is: false
