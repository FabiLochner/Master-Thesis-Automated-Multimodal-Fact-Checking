    Russia is reported to have fired its latest multiple-rocket system against Ukrainian targets in the Kharkiv area – a weapon described as a giant flamethrower.
    
    That is what a Russian security official told the state-run Tass news agency. It has not been confirmed officially.
    
    The TOS-2 Tosochka is a thermobaric fuel-air weapon: it creates massive explosions by igniting gas clouds on impact, depriving anyone in the area of oxygen.
    
    Ukraine has pushed Russian forces back from the outskirts of Kharkiv, the second city, which was visited by President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.
    
    Earlier Russia confirmed that it was using TOS-1 Solntsepyok (“Blazing Sun”) rockets against targets in the Donbas, where Ukrainian forces are under constant, intense bombardment.
    
    TOS-1 is also thermobaric, with a range of up to 10km (six miles). The TOS-2’s manufacturer Rostec says TOS-2 has a longer range, better automatic targeting and more versatility. TOS-2 rockets are carried on an armoured truck, not a tank chassis.

    It was a rare trip for President Zelensky outside Kyiv. He visited troops on the frontline near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, handed out awards and gifts, and thanked soldiers for their service.
    
    “You’re risking your life for all of us and our state,” he said. “Thank you for defending Ukraine’s independence. Take care!”
    
    The visit was a demonstration of the country’s success in pushing Russian forces back from the city. And was probably intended to boost morale as Ukraine tries to contain a massive Russian offensive in the Donbas area further east.
    
    An onslaught that is causing enormous suffering and destruction.
    
    Hours after the president left, loud explosions were reported in Kharkiv. A message that the threat posed by the invading forces there may have subsided, but it’s not entirely gone.

    Verdi's Rigoletto is being performed at Kyiv's Opera House
    
    Ukraine’s capital is 1,540 years old this weekend, and you’d be forgiven for assuming Kyiv wasn’t in the mood to celebrate.
    
    After all, it’s just over three months ago that the city found itself surrounded by Russian forces, with some predicting it would fall within 72 hours.
    
    At the time, I remember standing outside the Opera House, where the only gathering of people was outside a nearby pharmacy - scared and angry.
    
    Today it's a different scene. There is a sea of smiling faces, colourful outfits and cheerful chatter as people walk in to watch a performance of Verdi's Rigoletto. Shows returned last week; and you can’t help but feel the joy of those lucky enough to get a ticket. Tickets are limited to 300, the capacity of the theatre's bomb shelter.
    
    !Kyiv <image:1637>
    
    “Life really goes on and we do not stop,” says Pavlo, one of the soldiers in uniform, in passing. “We hope for the best and believe everything is going to be alright”.
    
    Backstage one of the lead singers, Olga Fomichova, sits illuminated by her make up mirror. “I can see our audience needs us, from the sold-out tickets, but it won’t be the same” she admits.
    
    “I don’t have anger or defiance, only the desire to be heard, that the Ukrainians are a cultural and educated nation which deserves world-wide respect and attention.”
    
    For several of its 1,540 years, other rulers and empires have tried to take Kyiv by force. Some have been more successful than others, but few predicted such attempts would be made in 2022.

    !Volodymyr Zelensky visits Kharkiv <image:1640>Image source, Ukraine President's Office
    
    Volodymyr Zelensky has not turned out to be the president many predicted. The former comedian, the voice of Ukrainian Paddington Bear, was once mocked as a lightweight.
    
    Now, he is compared to Winston Churchill.
    
    His steadfastness in the face of overwhelming Russian force is credited by many as being a crucial factor in his country’s remarkable performance in the beginning of this war.
    
    His defiant videos from the streets of the capital, Kyiv, were a metaphorical middle finger to Russia and its president.
    
    While President Zelensky would appear with his colleagues, arms around their shoulders, Vladimir Putin was pictured at one end of an almost comedically long table, his officials barely in shouting distance.
    
    As effective as they were, however, those appearances were all in the capital. Today’s visit to Kharkiv is the first time he has left the Kyiv region since the start of Russia’s invasion.
    
    He met the troops that have not just defended Kharkiv, but repelled the Russians, almost pushing them back to the international border.
    
    The fact that he was able to visit shows just how much the tide has turned in Ukraine’s second city. A few weeks ago, this morale boosting visit would never have been possible.
    
    But, do not be mistaken, Kharkiv is only safe for now. Elsewhere, Ukraine very much appears on the back foot, withering Russian artillery barrages forcing them to retreat in the Donbas.
    
    With its charismatic president, Ukraine has very much won the informational war. Unfortunately for them, that is not where this conflict will ultimately be decided.

    Stopping Russia is the common mission of all civilised countries, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak has said.
    
    "'Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the East?' - such a narrative is promoted by Russian agents," he wrote in a tweet.
    
    The Ukraine war is not a local conflict - it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow, he added.
    
    Allowing Russia to win would "open Pandora's box and push humanity into the dark ages."
    
    Podolyak went on to say: "Any autocrat would be able to provoke territorial conflicts, seize countries and exterminate nations.
    
    "Stopping Russia is a mission of all civilized countries. There's time, but we should hurry up."

7.  !Kherson pictured on 20 May <image:1643>Image source, Getty Images
    
    Moscow-imposed authorities in the southern city of Kherson say nearby fighting could affect the timing of its formal bid to join Russia.
    
    Russian forces occupied Kherson in early March - one week after the invasion of Ukraine began. It was the first major city to fall.
    
    Kirill Stremousov, deputy-head of [Kherson's Moscow-installed administration](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-61338617)
    , says the process might involve a referendum, backtracking on previous comments suggesting none was needed.
    
    According to Reuters news agency, he says: "We'll announce later when some kind of vote or plebiscite is planned, but it won’t be today and it won’t be tomorrow because our first task is to restore order in the Kherson region."
    
    Russia has said that the fate of the Kherson region is for local residents to decide.
    
    But the UK Ministry of Defence said, [in an intelligence update in April, external](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1518335593482268672)
    , a referendum would be a way for Russia to justify its occupation of Ukraine.
    
    And President Zelensky has said it fits in with Russia's plans of breaking Ukraine apart by creating "pseudo-republics" throughout the country.
    
    He has advised people [not to give the Russian authorities any personal data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61188943)
    , such as passport numbers, as they might be used to falsify votes.

8.  More now on President Zelensky's rare trip outside of the capital Kyiv.
    
    He visited the frontline in the Kharkiv region where he spoke with troops and presented gifts.
    
    It comes as intense fighting continues in the region as troops attempt to regain control of the area from the Russians.
    
    Here are some more pictures of his visit.

    Mr Zelensky visited front line positions in the Kharkiv region, it said.
    
    "I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our state," the president told troops.
    
    The north-easten city has seen some of the worst fighting since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.

10.  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said last week's talks with Finnish and Swedish delegations were not at the "expected level" and Ankara cannot approve their applications to join the Nato military alliance.
    
    "For as long as Tayyip Erdogan is the head of the Republic of Turkey, we definitely cannot say 'yes' to countries which support terrorism entering Nato," the president said.
    
    Without the support of all Nato members, Sweden and Finland cannot join the military alliance.
    
    Both Nordic countries deny supporting Kurdish militants. But they have joined other EU countries in imposing a weapons embargo on Turkey following its operations against Kurdish groups in Syria.

12.  As we reported earlier, Russia's defence ministry says its missiles have destroyed a large arsenal of Ukrainian army weapons in Kryvyi Rih - the home city of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    
    Now we can bring you more details. Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claims in the last 24 hours more than 300 "nationalists" \[Ukrainian soldiers\] have been killed.
    
    He also claims a number of other Ukrainian military targets were hit in the offensive, including a Russian defence systems shooting down a Ukrainian SU-25 fighter jet in Dnipro.
    
    He says: "In total, as a result of Russian air strikes, more than 300 nationalists and up to 50 units of military and special equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine were destroyed."

13.  The governor of the Luhansk region has accused Russia of systematically destroying the city of Severodonetsk and its residents.
    
    Serhiy Haidai said the attacks were relentless as fierce fighting rages in the area.
    
    Severodonetsk is the easternmost place in the Donbas region still held by Ukraine and it is currently a key target for Russian forces.
    
    The Luhansk governor said more civilians in the city had been killed in the latest attacks and buildings had been destroyed, including apartment blocks and a cinema.
    
    But he said Russian troops trying to capture a vital road out had been driven back.
    
    Earlier Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the situation remained difficult in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions where he said Russia was trying to "squeeze out some result for itself".

    [What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61618902)
    , we’ve been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.
    
    All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.
    
    What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.
    
    Where the [horrors of Bucha](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60981238)
     are dismissed as a fabrication, and where the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.
    
    In other words, none of this is ever Russia’s fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.
    
    This is the Kremlin narrative which we’ve heard many times before. We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we’re hearing it again now.

16.  !The BBC's Clive Myrie with Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin <image:1653>
    
    As we've previously reported, Russia's ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    He has also criticised the UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for her tough stance on Russia. Britain has [imposed a number of sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659)
    , as well as sending weapons to Ukraine.
    
    Ambassador Andrei Kelin told the BBC's Clive Myrie: "She's neither a professional military man or she's not for a long time at this position.
    
    "But she's very belligerent...
    
    "On the position that UK would like to supply more and more arms, \[but\] not to think about the future of Ukraine or of Europe...
    
    "But just to instigate conflict. Why this? What's the motivation for that?
    
    "To make Russia more feeble?"
    
    The ambassador added that Russia's economy has not "toppled down" despite the restrictions and asked what the benefit of sanctions was for the UK, which has [seen inflation hit a 40-year high](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175)
    , partly driven by the Ukraine war.
    
    After sanctions were imposed on Russia, the rouble fell 22% in value pushing up the price of imported goods, before it recovered.
    
    More than 1,000 international companies have also suspended trading in Russia or withdrawn altogether - including McDonalds, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.

    The question about negotiating in a war depends on the battlefield and on the state of mind of the parties contesting it.
    
    It has to get to a point where either side is suffering so much they are prepared to go into negotiations and give some ground, or that one side feels it has achieved enough and it is prepared to bank those gains.
    
    But at the moment I think both the Russians and Ukrainians have unfinished agendas.
    
    The Ukrainians want the Russians out. The Russians want to move forward and make their points, and deliver a victory.
    
    So I think politically there is no chance right now for a negotiation that means anything other than people getting together and talking in a room.

18.  Russia has rejected accusations that its invasion of Ukraine has created serious threats to global food security, instead blaming Western sanctions.
    
    The West has accused the Russian military of holding food supplies hostage for millions around the world.
    
    The war in Ukraine has blocked the country's main ports on the Black sea, severely impacting food supply chains around the world. Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, but now millions of tonnes of grain are stuck - impacting the countries that can least afford it.
    
    "The attempts of the West to attribute all troubles to the special military operation and accuse Russia of blocking foreign ships in the ports of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov are absolutely groundless," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
    
    "The main catalyst for the existing negative trends was the anti-Russian sanctions of the West, which led to a rupture of ties in the field of global logistics and transport infrastructure," she said.
    
    The hike in prices for agricultural products started in 2020 "and is by no means a result of the special military operation" in Ukraine she claimed, before also blaming Covid.
    
    The pandemic "has severely disrupted value chains and significantly increased the cost of food transportation services", she added.

    The war is especially raging in the east of Ukraine in the Donbas region.
    
    Russian forces have launched a number of assaults around the city of Severodonetsk, which is increasingly finding itself surrounded.
    
    Military experts think there is not much for Russia to gain economically or militarily by taking the city other than to declare some kind of early victory in the war, as it remains the last major city not in Russian control in the region of Luhansk.
    
    What isn't clear is whether Russian President Vladimir Putin, should the Donbas region fall, will continue to try and take more of Ukraine.
    
    It's been another night where we've seen more missile attacks, which continually raise questions over what happens next.

20.  Russia’s ambassador to the UK has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.
    
    Speaking to Clive Myrie, Andrei Kelin said such weapons would be used only if Russia’s existence was threatened.
    
    The ambassador also denied Russian forces were shelling civilians, and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a "fabrication".
    
    Kelin's claims are contradicted by numerous [eyewitness accounts from residents](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61003878)
    , who have told the BBC that Russian troops executed their loved ones.
    
    The full interview can be seen in the UK on the Sunday Morning programme, BBC One 9am.

Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops

!Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he met Ukrainian troops <image:1659>

Ukraine's president has made a rare trip outside the capital, Kiev, the presidential office says.

According to foreign media, Telegrafi reports, Zelensky visited the frontline positions in the Kharkiv region.

! <image:1660>

  

"I want to thank each of you for your service. You risk your life for all of us and our country", the president told the troops.

! <image:1661>

The northeastern city has seen some of the fiercest fighting since Russia launched its aggression in Ukraine on February 24.

! <image:1662>

His visit comes as Ukraine has begun receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and others from the US.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov was quoted as saying that the supply of Harpoon missiles was the result of cooperation between several countries.

Ukraine has sought more sophisticated weapons, but so far most of the help has been in short-range systems, such as anti-tank weapons.

Meanwhile, the US is said to be considering a request from Ukraine to supply Kiev with heavier, longer-range weapons, but has yet to make a final decision. /**Telegraph**/

The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) states that Zelensky visited troops in the Kharkiv region (<image:1645>, <image:1649>). Telegrafi.com ([https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/)) also mentions Zelensky's visit to the front line in the Kharkiv region and includes the image (<image:1659>, <image:1660>, <image:1661>, <image:1662>, <image:1663>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image (<image:7>) depicts Volodymyr Zelensky visiting troops in the Kharkiv region, not the Kursk region. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) and Telegrafi.com ([https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/)) both support this.

The claim that the image shows Zelensky in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates the location was the Kharkiv region.

The claim also mentions the Kursk Offensive, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In November 2024 Russia sentenced a man to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran."

## Actions
```
image_search("Russia man sentenced Quran burning November 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters reports that a Russian man was sentenced to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran in November 2024 (<image:6194>). The Moscow Times also reports on the jailing of a Russian man for burning the Quran (<image:6195>).

The Guardian published an article on November 5, 2024, about a Swedish court jailing a far-right leader who burned the Quran (<image:6196>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.

## Claim
Claim: "As of February 2025, the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine for its war with Russia."

## Actions
```
image_search("United States military aid Ukraine Russia war")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/13/biden-announces-additional-800m-us-military-aid-to-ukraine): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on April 13, 2022, about the United States announcing an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. <image:6231>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes an article from April 13, 2022, stating that the U.S. announced an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. This information is insufficient to verify the claim.

The claim states that as of February 2025, the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid. The evidence only provides information about an announcement made in April 2022.

To verify the claim, I would need information about the total amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine up to February 2025.


## Actions
```
image_search("US military aid to Ukraine February 2025")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence includes articles from February and March 2025, discussing U.S. military aid to Ukraine. However, the evidence does not specify the amount of aid provided.

The claim states that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The provided evidence does not confirm or deny this amount.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but lacks specific details about his assets, bank accounts, and income. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, but the content is not provided.

PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.

# Record

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), has no content. The second source, from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/exclusive-wife-of-ukraine-president-elect-got-penthouse-bargain-from-tycoon-idUSKCN1S81TE/), contains an image of a building <image:6251>. The third source, from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/oceanfront-florida-mansion-whose-ownership-184443105.html), contains images of a Florida mansion <image:6252>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>). Sky News shows a plane landing in the UK, possibly belonging to Zelenskyy (<image:6263>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The first source, from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240219354828/en/Florida-Oceanfront-Mansion-Not-Purchased-by-Ukraines-Zelenskyy-Heads-to-Luxury-Auction), has no content.

The third source, from [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/oceanfront-florida-mansion-whose-ownership-184443105.html), contains images of a Florida mansion <image:6252>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from [aa.com.tr](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/ukrainian-president-urges-swiss-government-to-freeze-bank-accounts-of-russian-oligarchs/2540426) with no content. PBS NewsHour has an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6258>). Al Jazeera published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy (<image:6259>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy near planes. One image from ABC News shows Zelenskyy arriving in the United States on a plane (<image:6261>), and another from ABC News Australia shows Zelenskyy near a plane (<image:6262>). Sky News shows a plane landing in the UK, possibly belonging to Zelenskyy (<image:6263>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, about Volodymyr Zelenskyy publishing his income as part of a transparency drive. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy. <image:6270>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides some information about Zelenskyy's assets, but it is insufficient to verify the claim. The image search results show images of a Florida mansion and Zelenskyy near planes, but do not confirm ownership. The Reuters article mentions Zelenskyy publishing his income, which could be used to verify the claim about his income, but the article's content is not provided. The claim about the bank account cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, I would need information about Zelenskyy's property ownership, bank accounts, and income.

However, the article's content is not provided, so I cannot verify the claim about the $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account. The evidence does not provide information about the number of homes, private planes, or monthly income.

# Your Analysis

The evidence is still insufficient to verify the claim. The Financial Times article provides an image of Zelenskyy, but no information about his property, financial assets, or income. The claim remains unverified due to a lack of specific details about Zelenskyy's assets.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview. However, the evidence does not contain the content of the interview, so it is impossible to verify the claim that Zelenskyy stated that his country's military has received only a portion of the U.S. aid.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that a claim about Netanyahu proposing to resettle Gaza residents to Ukraine and Syria has been labeled as "FAKE" by StopFake.org ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)). The additional search results show images of Netanyahu at the White House, but they do not provide any information to support the claim.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is likely false.

The Hill published an article about Netanyahu and Gaza resettlement ([https://thehill.com/opinion/4973704-netanyahu-gaza-resettlement/](https://thehill.com/opinion/4973704-netanyahu-gaza-resettlement/)) <image:6401>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Soufan Center ([https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/)) provides an image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump in the White House <image:6408>. Chatham House provides an image of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu <image:6409>. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c1menr8xnk9t](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c1menr8xnk9t)) provides an image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump in the White House <image:6410>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a claim about Netanyahu proposing to resettle Gaza residents to Ukraine and Syria has been labeled as "FAKE" by StopFake.org ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)). The additional search results show images of Netanyahu at the White House, but they do not provide any information to support the claim.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is likely false.

* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-april-7-2025/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-april-7-2025/)) provides an image of Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House <image:6390>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.

However, the evidence does not confirm that Trump announced an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on that specific date. Additional searches did not provide the missing information.

CNN reports on a phone call between Putin and Trump (<image:6420>). Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war (<image:6421>).

Reuters contains an image of a newspaper with photos of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, mentioning a phone call on February 12, 2025 (<image:6423>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to Donald Trump and the war in Ukraine. One source from WHYY.org ([Source](https://whyy.org/articles/trump-pauses-aid-ukraine-russia-war/)) contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6428>. Another source from CFR.org ([Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-trump-could-make-good-deal-end-ukraine-war)) also contains an image of Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy <image:6429>.

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)) published an article on February 19, 2025, stating that Trump said he would probably meet Putin that month <image:6430>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a phone call on February 12, 2025. Al Jazeera reports that Trump said Putin wants peace and will begin talks on ending the Ukraine war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the phone call and Trump's statements about Putin's interest in peace are confirmed, the specific claim about an agreement is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump announced an agreement to end the war.

Content: Al Jazeera reports on February 26, 2025, that Trump said Ukraine's Zelenskyy would sign a "very big deal" regarding rare earths. <image:6441>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from Al Jazeera, dated February 26, 2025, reports that Trump mentioned a "very big deal" involving Ukraine's Zelenskyy regarding rare earths. This does not confirm that Trump announced an agreement to end the war in Ukraine on February 12, 2025, as the claim states.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that NDTV did interview Tulsi Gabbard. The Halifax City News article, available at [https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/](https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/03/17/gabbard-says-trump-is-looking-forward-to-success-ahead-of-talk-with-putin/), mentions an interview with Gabbard on March 17, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether Gabbard said that Trump and Putin were good friends. To verify this part of the claim, the content of the NDTV interview and the Halifax City News article needs to be checked.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes a map showing military routes and bases in the area of Japan, Korea, and Russia, and another map showing Chinese and Russian warships near Japan. This suggests military activity in the region, but it does not confirm any invasion plans.

The presence of military assets and routes does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is needed.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The evidence shows the presence of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia, and a historical map of the Russo-Japanese War. This suggests military activity and historical conflict in the region, but it does not confirm any current invasion plans.

The Financial Times map shows the location of Chinese navy ships, which could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic positioning. However, this does not directly imply an invasion plan. The Britannica map provides historical context, but it is not relevant to the current claim.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes a map showing military routes and bases in the area of Japan, Korea, and Russia, and another map showing Chinese and Russian warships near Japan. This suggests military activity in the region, but it does not confirm any invasion plans.

The presence of military assets and routes does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan. The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about any official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is needed.

## Elaboration
The evidence shows the presence of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia, and a historical map of the Russo-Japanese War. This suggests military activity and historical conflict in the region, but it does not confirm any current invasion plans.

The Financial Times map shows the location of Chinese navy ships, which could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic positioning. However, this does not directly imply an invasion plan. The Britannica map provides historical context, but it is not relevant to the current claim.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Financial Times published a map showing the location of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia <image:6562>. Britannica includes a map of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5) <image:6564>.

*   [Source](https://www.ft.com/content/3a6f7efe-b064-45a7-8125-259a51df8a20)
*   [Source](https://www.britannica.com/event/Russo-Japanese-War)


## Elaboration
The evidence shows the presence of Chinese navy ships near Japan and Russia, and a historical map of the Russo-Japanese War. This suggests military activity and historical conflict in the region, but it does not confirm any current invasion plans.

The Financial Times map shows the location of Chinese navy ships, which could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic positioning. However, this does not directly imply an invasion plan. The Britannica map provides historical context, but it is not relevant to the current claim.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.


## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters reports that China and Russia held joint military exercises in 2022 (<image:6571>). CNN reports on naval exercises near Japan (<image:6573>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that China and Russia have conducted joint military exercises, and there have been naval exercises near Japan. However, this does not confirm the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.

The military exercises could be interpreted as a show of force or a strategic partnership, but they do not directly imply an invasion plan.

The claim remains unverified due to a lack of direct evidence of invasion plans. Information about official statements, military strategies, or troop movements that suggest an invasion plan is still missing.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows military activity and exercises involving China, Japan, and Russia, but it does not provide any evidence of invasion plans. The search results include maps of military routes and naval activity, as well as reports of joint military exercises. However, these activities do not confirm the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence, including maps of military activity and reports of joint military exercises between China, Japan, and Russia, does not provide any direct evidence to support the claim of an invasion plan. The presence of military assets and exercises does not necessarily indicate an invasion plan, and the claim remains unverified.

При [бегстве из Балаклеи](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/v-balaklee-i-okrestnyih-selah-podnyali-ukrainskie-flagi-foto-i-video/278860)
 в Харьковской области российские оккупанты потеряли очень много живой силы и техники.

Подробности феерического отступления россиян появляются в сети.

Украинский журналист Денис Казанский [опубликовал](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3989)
 красноречивое фото, на котором два бойца ВСУ "селфятся" на фоне лежащего на земле "орка".

"_Теперь уже можно! Балаклея - это Украина!_", - подписан кадр.

![](https://static.apostrophe.ua/uploads/image/d65ce3221fb2320e1df433cbd2684f2e.jpg)

Кроме того, в Балаклее у оккупантов очень большие потери. Россияне драпали так быстро, что [бросали](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3991?single)
 тела погибших сослуживцев.

**Осторожно, жесткие кадры! 18+**

Разгром российской армии в Балаклее стал расплатой за Иловайск в 2014 году, [отмечает](https://t.me/kazansky2017/3994)
 журналист, добавляя, что на дорогах в округе повсюду разбитая и брошенная техника оккупантов.

Еще один украинский журналист Анатолий Цаплиенко [сообщает](https://t.me/Tsaplienko/15021)
, что россияне пробовали убежать, но на дороге их встретила засада украинских бойцов. Чем все закончилось, можно посмотреть на видео.

Напомним, Президент Украины [Владимир Зеленский официально подтвердил освобождение города Балаклеи в Харьковской области от российских оккупантов](https://apostrophe.ua/news/society/2022-09-08/teper-ofitsialno-zelenskiy-podtverdil-osvobojdenie-balaklei-ot-okkupantov/278876)

##### Президент Зеленский предположил, что война может завершиться в 2026 году. Верите ли вы в это?

Да, это возможно

Нет, сомневаюсь

Трудно сказать

!Оккупанты понесли огромные потери при паническом бегстве из Балаклеи <image:2752>

Российские войска отступают. Как развивается украинское контрнаступление и чем успехи ВСУ последних недель грозят России — мнение экспертов и российских военных

Украина [объявила](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 о контрнаступлении на юге страны в Херсонской области 29 августа, а 6 сентября начала наступательную операцию на востоке — в Харьковской области. За это время украинская армия освободила десятки населенных пунктов и продвинулась вглубь российских оборонительных позиций. Поступают сообщения о том, что российские войска отступают из стратегически важных городов — Балаклеи, Купянска, Изюма, Волчанска и Лимана. Военные эксперты называют события последних двух недель невообразимым [успехом](https://republic.ru/posts/105163)

### **Российские войска не могут держать оборону и бегут**

«8 лет говорили что и когда будут делать: один треп, обо всем со всех щелей. Никакой тактики, никакого профессионализма, никакого ума. Когда на это \[контрнаступление ВСУ\] смотрим мы \[военные\], мы понимаем, что изначально все было сделано неправильно. Но забили на это хуй, начали двигаться дальше криво, коряво. А с другой \[украинской\] стороны, люди просто взяли, увидели это, соорганизовались, все сделали. ‎

Поэтому в плане войны все выглядит очень логично: мы начали как долбоебы, не смогли ничего удержать, всё разъебали, один сплошной пиздеж вокруг, командования ноль, обеспечения ноль, руководства ноль. И вот изначально было понятно, что будет заканчиваться тем, что нас просто разнесут», — комментирует «‎Важным историям»‎ ситуацию на фронте бывший российский военнослужащий, который участвовал в войне в Украине. «Вспоминаю, как долго \[ВС РФ\] ковыряли Мариуполь и Северодонецк, а тут два дня \[понадобилось ВСУ\]. \[При том, что\] Изюм чуть ли не с первых дней войны был под контролем \[российских войск\], то есть они даже не планировали и не думали, что его, возможно, придется оборонять», — недоумевает другой бывший российский военный.

При этом, в [брифинге](https://t.me/mod_russia/19716)
 российского Минобороны от 10 сентября не было сказано ни слова об оставленных российскими войсками городах. Позже Минобороны [объяснило](https://t.me/mod_russia/19719)
 отступление российских войск «операцией по свертыванию и переброске Изюмско-Балаклейской группировки» для наращивания усилий по «освобождению Донбасса».

«Сейчас мы видим, как российские войска бегут, потому что не могут держать оборону», — описывает происходящее украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. Этому предшествовал первый крупный успех ВСУ в Харьковской области — освобождение 8 сентября города Балаклея, который был оккупирован с марта. «Это место, где сосредоточены склады с боеприпасами для артиллерии, поэтому \[ее освобождение\] достаточно серьезно усилит огневые возможности ВСУ», — говорит военный эксперт.

Именно освобождение Балаклеи позволило ВСУ лишить российскую группировку, которая там сконцентрирована, возможности держать оборону, поскольку отрезало их от «логистической артерии» Волчанск-Большой Бурлук-Купянск-Изюм, по которой происходило снабжение армии, объясняет эксперт. «Без снабжения вся эта масса личного состава и техники, сконцентрированная на Изюмском направлении, оказалась бы не боеспособной», — говорит Коваленко.

По словам российского военного эксперта Юрия Федорова, у российских войск на этом направлении «очень крупные потери»: не только убитыми, но и пленными: «как минимум сотни пленных, если не пара тысяч».

Вероятное большое количество пленных подтверждают и двое бывших военнослужащих российской армии. «При спонтанном отступлении особенно много пленных. Связи внутри подразделений нет. Кто где находится, командиры не всегда знают. Соответственно, об отступлении не все могут знать», — говорят они. Бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений в разговоре с «Важными историями» отметил, что на Харьковском направлении обе стороны несут ощутимые потери. «Когда мои говорят: „Бля, там пиздец“, значит, что всё плохо», — добавил собеседник «Важных историй».

### **Почему провалилась российская оборона**

Несмотря на то, что в Харьковской области было сконцентрировано больше российских войск, чем задействовано сил ВСУ в контрнаступлении на этом участке, операция была направлена на особо уязвимые места, где возможности российских подразделений по обороне были истощены, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Российское командование знало, что у них есть уязвимые места в Харьковской области, они даже пытались их в значительной степени усилить. Знали, но предотвратить \[исход событий\] не могли: нехватка ресурсов уже начала сказываться на их возможностях по ведению обороны. И сейчас мы наблюдаем каскадный обвал обороны», — объясняет Александр Коваленко.

*   [ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська](https://cripo.com.ua/news/war/zsu-vzhe-na-okolytsyah-okupovanogo-kup-yanska/ "Permalink to ЗСУ вже на околицях окупованого Куп’янська")
    

Российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров говорит, что в Харьковской области украинская армия использовала новую тактику, которая и обеспечила успех на этом направлении. «ВСУ действуют очень динамично и фактически не задерживаются на то, чтобы штурмовать те или иные города. Они просто их обходят, берут в кольцо, и тогда гарнизоны этих городков и небольших сел просто вынуждены капитулировать, — рассказывает российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров.

— Сейчас уже практически взят Купянск, по крайней мере, та часть, которая находится на правом берегу. Сдан Изюм или находится в процессе. Российские войска уходят оттуда, чтобы не попасть в окружение. Это, в общем, разумное решение, потому что коммуникации перерезаны. Сам по себе Изюм находится на стыке двух рек: Оскол и Северский Донец. Если его окружить, скажем, с северо-востока или с севера, то он просто будет отрезан от подвоза боеприпасов и всего прочего, и \[российская армия\] вынуждена будет капитулировать. Чтобы этого не случилось, они просто выводят войска, пока есть возможность».

Юрий Федоров считает, что ВСУ тактически и оперативно переиграли российские войска, которым не хватило ресурсов для сдерживания этого наступления. «\[Сначала\] была прорвана оборона в районе Балаклеи. А затем российские войска были разбросаны гарнизонами по различным городкам, селам. Эти гарнизоны часто состояли из Росгвардии, а также мобилизованных из так называемых народных республик.

Росгвардия в принципе воевать не умеет, она не для этого предназначена. Задача этих гарнизонов и гвардейских полков заключалась в том, чтобы держать в подчинении местное население. А среди мобилизованных многие в первый раз взяли в руки автомат, надели каску, мотивации \[у них нет\] никакой. Российские регулярные части были отведены частично на правобережье в Херсонскую область, частично на Донецкое направление, где они пытались штурмовать пригород Донецка, занятый ВСУ. Поэтому вот такой разгром», — объясняет военный эксперт.

Это же подтверждает в разговоре с «Важными историями» и российский военнослужащий, который был на этом направлении. «\[Подведомственные\] Минобороны \[войска\], группировка Восток, вышли с этого направления еще в июле в Белгородскую область. На тот момент в Изюме я встречал БАРСов (_боевой армейский резерв страны_ — **Прим. ред.**), ополченцев и войска ПВО Западного округа. После \[их\] выхода в Изюм зашёл СОБР и ОМОН. Соответственно, там действительно остались только „БАРСики“, ополченцы и Росгвардия», — говорит он.

По словам эксперта Федорова, российское командование просчиталось в оценке ситуации, когда перебросило боевые части с юга Харьковской области на другие направления до начала контрнаступления. «Считалось, что в районе расположения изюмской группировки ничего страшного случиться не может. Просчет заключался в том, что не была оценена вероятность того, что украинские войска начнут там наступление», — говорит Федоров.

«Российское командование с профессиональной точки зрения оценивают как очень слабое. Это люди, которые умеют бросать в бой значительное количество живой силы, но отсутствует инициатива в исполнении приказа. Написано „занять такой-то перекресток“, а может быть, лучше занять другой перекресток рядышком, но это недопустимая вещь, \[только\] тупое упорное выполнение приказа», — добавляет он.

«Нельзя, чтобы армия, которая строилась двадцать лет, сегодня такая: все, мы будем работать по-другому. Нас заставляли быть тупыми и не принимать никаких решений, — подтверждает бывший военнослужащий российской армии. — Попробуй сержанту скажи, что ты считаешь, что лучше вот так вот. Тебе ебало просто сломают, если не застрелят сразу. И так на всех уровнях. Верховный главнокомандующий принимает только „‎правильные“‎ решения — а все остальные должны их исполнять. И если что, они будут нести наказание, не потому что сверху долбоебы, а потому что „‎вы плохо \[приказы\] исполняете, вы не исполнительные“»‎, — говорит он.

![Український контрнаступ та звільнення міста Балаклія Харківської області та навколишніх сіл](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20960'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Самые успешные операции за всю мою службу были те, о которых знали только мы. Только те люди, которые в ней участвуют. Потому что стоит таким заняться командованию… Поэтому когда мы сами решали, что делать, не ожидая команды сверху или пока качнут связь, чтобы уточнить, связаться, запросить разрешение на выполнение, уточнение и прочую херню, мы всегда все выполняли на 100 %», — отмечает бывший военнослужащий одного из элитных подразделений ВС РФ.

Накануне, 9 сентября, Минобороны [показало](https://t.me/mod_russia/19710)
 кадры переброски военной техники в Харьковскую область, но это подкрепление не помогло отстоять города. «Этих подкреплений крайне недостаточно, — говорит Юрий Федоров. — Даже вертолетами перебрасывали личный состав и легкую технику. Но это все равно, что пытаться из пипетки наполнить стакан, практически бессмысленная задача».

Александр Коваленко объясняет это тем, что переброска поддержки была лишь пропагандистским жестом. «Российской армии срочно понадобилось демонстрировать некую активность, что „помощь близка“, „мы своих не бросаем“, якобы они готовы оказывать поддержку тем подразделениям, которые оказались в сложной ситуации. Но эта переброска имела неорганизованный, хаотический характер, она не могла обеспечить никакой поддержки», — говорит эксперт.

По его словам, те подразделения, которые зашли в зону боевых действий для поддержки, были обречены. Многие из них давным-давно требовали ротации или вывода для восстановления боеспособности из-за понесенных до этого серьезных потерь. «В ближайшее время мы будем узнавать о большом количестве подразделений российской армии, которые попросту перестали существовать, поскольку вместо вывода на восстановление боеспособности их кинули в самую мясорубку, самое жерло боевых столкновений», — говорит он.

### **Чем российской армии грозит прорыв ВСУ**

Освобождение Купянска и Изюма важно в стратегическом смысле тем, что оно отрезает российские группировки от путей снабжения и открывает ВСУ путь на Луганское и Донецкое направление, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Эти города важны тем, что они являются неотъемлемой частью логистических артерий поставок техники, материально-технического обеспечения, боеприпасов, личного состава как в Харьковскую область, так и в целом на донбасский плацдарм. Купянск является очень важным логистическим узлом, сердцем этой артерии.

Через него шло обеспечение города Изюм, который стал центром сосредоточения самой большой бронетанковой группы российских оккупантов за все время полномасштабного вторжения в Украину, — говорит эксперт. — И вся эта масса должна была идти в сторону Славянска и Краматорска. Сейчас планы по захвату Славянска и Краматорска можно считать аннулированными. Потеря \[российской армией\] таких населенных пунктов как Купянск и Изюм полностью рушит систему обеспечения донбасского плацдарма и позволяет ВСУ в дальнейшем развивать контрнаступательные действия уже не только в Харьковской области, но и в Луганском и Донецком направлениях».

В ближайшие дни можно ожидать, что Харьковская область будет освобождена, уверен российский военный эксперт Юрий Федоров. «Это не решающее сражение, но очень крупный успех ВСУ», — говорит он. По его словам, тогда вооруженные силы Украины смогут перебросить значительное количество личного состава и на другие направления.

Херсонская область
------------------

### **Российской армии не хватает сил для обороны**

Еще одно не менее важное направление, на котором продолжают наступать силы ВСУ, — контролируемый российскими войсками плацдарм на правом берегу Днепра в Херсонской области. Украинское контрнаступление началось там 29 августа. В тот день, по [данным](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 оперативной группировки ВСУ «Каховка», ей удалось «прорвать первую линию обороны» в Херсонской области. «109 полк „ДНР“ отошел со своих позиций, российские десантники, которые были их поддержкой, сбежали с поля боя», — [говорилось](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1018539645523163)
 в сообщении. 4 сентября ВСУ [установили](https://www.facebook.com/kirill.timoshenko/posts/5588117717898633)
 украинский флаг в крупном населенном пункте Высокополье.

Точная численность российской группировки, которая находится на правом берегу Днепра, где Украина ведет контрнаступление, неизвестна. По разным оценкам, на начало контрнаступления там находилось от [20](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/ukraine-russia-war-kherson/31989285.html)
 до [25 тысяч](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/32011307.html)
 российских военных. Нет точных данных и о численности украинской группировки. Источник «Важных историй» из числа бывших сотрудников российской спецслужбы, пожелавший остаться анонимным, говорит, что для контрнаступления в Херсонской области Украина сформировала «довольно скромные резервы»: их численность — 10–12 тысяч человек.

Однако, по его словам, у Украины есть еще резервы, не брошенные в контрнаступление, которые не должны позволить российской стороне замкнуть окружение вокруг прорвавшихся вперед войск. Максимальную оценку украинских сил на этом фронте [приводит](https://www.currenttime.tv/a/rf-boitsya-poteryat-litso-i-poetomu-otdaet-svoih-soldat-na-myaso-na-pravom-beregu-dnepra-eksperty-o-rasklade-sil-na-yuge-ukrainy-/32011763.html)
 украинский военный эксперт Роман Свитан: по его данным, там находится 30 тысяч бойцов ВСУ.

![Зеленым цветом обозначены освобожденные территории, красным — оккупированные территории Источник: Украинский проект deepstatemap. Последнее обновление: 10 сентября, 18:23](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20703'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

«Теми силами, которые присутствуют сейчас на правом берегу Днепра, российская армия в среднесрочной перспективе не сможет удерживать контрнаступление ВСУ», — уверен украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. По словам аналитика Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) Кирилла Михайлова, ВСУ удалось создать определенное превосходство в численности личного состава на основных направлениях наступления в Херсонской области. «К этому добавляется эффективная работа артиллерии и локальное превосходство Украины в воздухе, которое позволяет использовать как фронтовую авиацию, так и ударные беспилотники», — комментирует он расстановку сил.

По его словам, сейчас украинцы наступают в Херсонской области как минимум на трех направлениях: с запада; северо-запада, где они расширяют плацдарм на оккупированном \[Россией\] берегу реки Ингулец; и с севера, где им удалось взять крупный населенный пункт Высокополье и «затрофеить» большое количество военной техники российского десанта. На сегодня украинской армии удалось продвинуться на территорию более десяти населенных пунктов в Херсонской области, говорит Михайлов. «Хоть эти населенные пункты и небольшие, они являются оборонительными узлами. Пока мы видим преимущество на украинской стороне», — говорит он.

Нехватку ресурсов у российской группировки на этом направлении подтверждает и бывший сотрудник российской спецслужбы. «Из-за нехватки солдат и офицеров российские войска на фронте сосредоточены в недостаточном количестве. Людей примерно в три раза меньше, чем нужно для выполнения поставленных задач: требуется минимум одна батальонно-тактическая группа на 3 километра, а у России — одна на 5 километров. Такой численностью не наступают, это похоже на авантюру, — говорит он. — Прорвав первую линию \[обороны\] российских войск, украинское наступление должно было упереться во вторую линию, но проблема в том, что у российской военной группировки ее нет: из-за нехватки людей такие прорывы затыкают лишь мобильными резервами. И это может сделать ситуацию непредсказуемой».

Достоверных данных о потерях обеих сторон в этой схватке сейчас нет, говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов, но судя по [публикации](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims)
 The Economist (журналисты побывали в прифронтовом городе Николаеве, поговорили с местными врачами и не увидели там «переполненных моргов» с погибшими украинскими военными, о чем утверждает российская сторона), хоть потери украинской армии выросли с началом наступления, они не катастрофические, как это заявляет российское Минобороны. По словам бывшего сотрудника российской спецслужбы, с которым поговорили «Важные истории», потери украинской стороны высоки, потому что наступающая сторона всегда теряет больше обороняющейся.

На третий день контрнаступления в Херсонской области The Wall Street Journal [поговорила](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-soldiers-say-they-are-advancing-in-the-south-but-at-a-cost-11661983338)
 в госпитале с ранеными украинскими солдатами, которые участвовали в операции. По их словам, бои на пути к Херсону идут крайне ожесточенные, но украинские войска продвигаются вперед. «У них много техники, но мало людей», — сказал один из украинских военных. Кроме этого, они утверждают, что некоторые российские солдаты бегут со своих позиций, бросая технику и устанавливая мины на телах погибших товарищей.

По словам одного из российских военнослужащих, который сейчас находится в Херсонской области, российская армия там находится в тяжелом положении, солдаты массово пытаются уволиться. «Две недели назад командиры нам сказали, что на нас наступление идет. А нам даже боеприпасы никак не привезти, потому что дамба разбита (_вероятно, речь идет о дамбе в Новой Каховке_ — **Прим. ред.**). Люди каждый день ходят с рапортами \[на увольнение\], но почти всем их разрывают», — написал он. Спустя две недели военный передал «Важным историям», что при обстреле чудом выжил, и «там все жестко».

Другой источник, близкий к российским военнослужащим, которые находятся на Херсонском направлении, передал, что солдаты в полном шоке, «никто ничего не понимает, гибнут пачками, потери ужасные. Некоторые вообще звонят, прощаются, мы, говорят, смертники ебучие».

### **У российской армии проблемы со снабжением**

Еще одна проблема российской группировки, которая должна сдерживать прорыв украинской армии в Херсонской области, заключается в том, что она оказалась отрезанной от всех основных путей снабжения. Ранее снабжение российской группировки на правом берегу Днепра происходило через мосты, по которым везли боеприпасы, технику, топливо и продовольствие с левого берега реки. Однако в результате ударов ВСУ все стационарные мосты через Днепр были выведены из строя, понтонные и паромные переправы постоянно подвергаются обстрелам.

«\[Исход этого противостояния на правом берегу Днепра\] зависит от того, удастся ли россиянам организовать поставки \[снабжения\] паромами, поскольку все постоянные мосты перестали функционировать. Наладить понтонные переправы через Днепр \[российской армии\] не удалось. Сейчас функционирует несколько паромных переправ — их украинцам тяжелее поражать, чем мосты, потому что паромы мобильны, сложно предугадать, где они находятся.

Однако периодически украинцы пытаются поражать скопление российской техники в местах ожидания паромов. Это должно вызывать значительные проблемы со снабжением. Насколько россиянам хватит ресурсов для противостояния, зависит от того, смогут ли они эффективно перебрасывать подкрепление, а также от того, сколько продержатся силы ВДВ, пока у них не закончится техника, которая не отличается бронированностью», — говорит аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов.

### **Чем России грозит продвижение ВСУ** 

Освобождение украинскими войсками населенного пункта Высокополье в Херсонской области 4 сентября сделало невозможным для российской армии ведение наступательных действий в направлении Кривого Рога в Днепропетровской области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. «Это была крайняя северная точка, откуда россияне могли развернуть наступательную операцию в Криворожском направлении. В настоящее время эти возможности у них отсутствуют, — объясняет он.

— Кроме того, благодаря Высокополью ВСУ получили возможность расширить плацдарм в правобережной части Херсонской области и сформировать условия для контрнаступления на достаточно угрожающем участке для многих подразделений ВС РФ. Если ВСУ будут достаточно успешно развивать наступательные действия, то мы сможем говорить о том, что огромное количество российских подразделений может оказаться фактически в окружении».

Стратегический и политический смысл операции на Херсонском направлении для Украины в том, чтобы разгромить российскую группировку на правом берегу Днепра и освободить Херсон, считает аналитик CIT Кирилл Михайлов. «Это позволит задействовать экономические ресурсы области, а также продемонстрировать западным партнерам Украины \[поставщикам оружия\], что страна в состоянии наступать и выигрывать — нужно только больше \[поставок\] оружия.

Кроме этого, в долгосрочной перспективе ликвидация правобережного плацдарма устраняет перспективу наступления \[российской армии\] на Николаев, Кривой Рог и Одессу, потому что именно захват мостов и выход на правый берег Днепра был самым значительным успехом россиян на первом этапе операции. Ликвидация этого плацдарма сильно снижает угрозу всей правобережной Украине, в том числе западному Черноморью, которое критически важно для Украины с точки зрения, например, экспорта сельхозпродукции», — объясняет эксперт значимость операции на этом направлении.

Где еще наступают ВСУ и какая битва будет решающей
--------------------------------------------------

Кроме Херсонской и Харьковской областей, ВСУ осуществляют наступательные действия в Донецкой области, говорит украинский военный эксперт Александр Коваленко. В частности освобожден населенный пункт Озерное в Донецкой области. «Аналогичные новости будут поступать и из Луганской области, где значительно активизировались ВСУ, воспользовавшись ослаблением российских подразделений после достаточно продолжительного воздействия на них огневым потенциалом», — уверен эксперт.

По мнению Коваленко, решающей для этой войны битвой станет контрнаступление украинской армии в Запорожской области. «Битва за правобережную Херсонщину — это очень важный промежуточный этап. После ее завершения и освобождения Херсона будет освобождена и значительная часть ресурсов ВСУ, которые были задействованы для сдерживания российских оккупантов и для ведения этой контрнаступательной операции. И эти ресурсы могут быть использованы на других направлениях: Запорожской, Харьковской, Донецкой и Луганской областях.

Они сыграют решающую роль в значительном ускорении, увеличении активности и интенсивности действий ВСУ. Для командования российских войск очень важно сохранять контроль именно над Запорожской областью. Ее потеря для россиян — это фактически выстрел в висок, поскольку это станет потерей всего юга, а потеря всего юга — это и потеря Крыма. Выйдя в Запорожскую область, ВСУ получат возможность блокировать Крым с материковой части Украины и нанести удары по Керченскому мосту — то есть отрезать его от материковой части России и начать операцию по освобождению Крыма», — говорит он.

«Что война проиграна, можно было легко судить, когда не получилось взять Киев. Плюс сейчас начинается слякоть, холода, потом зима. И такие простые вещи как теплая одежда, нормальная обувь и место для ночлега, будут влиять как на на здоровье, так и на отношение людей на фронте к войне, — говорит бывший российский военный. — Это трагичный конец, которого мы и ожидали. Война работает в обе стороны: за что боролись, на то и напоролись. В наше руководство я не верю, конечно. Как родина нас кидает, мы и так знаем. Уже кинула, начиная с 14-го \[года\] — заканчивая сегодня. Сами это дерьмо устроили, естественно, мы охуеть как насосемся теперь. Проблема в том, что мы изначально на проигравшей и некомпетентной стороне были. Родина сначала кинула мясом, а теперь бросила умирать. И у этого нет ни цели, ни мотива, никакой пользы никому — ни единому человеку».

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:24>

## Elaboration
The image shows individuals wearing patches of the American flag. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the location or the date of the event. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim is based on the presence of the American flag patches, which suggests the involvement of Americans. However, without additional information about the context, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the location, date, and the identity of the individuals in the image.

* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:24>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:24>

## Elaboration
The image shows individuals wearing patches of the American flag. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the location or the date of the event. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The claim is based on the presence of the American flag patches, which suggests the involvement of Americans. However, without additional information about the context, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the location, date, and the identity of the individuals in the image.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that patches combining the American and Ukrainian flags are available for sale. This suggests that the presence of an American flag patch does not necessarily indicate the involvement of American mercenaries.

The image search results show that such patches are commercially available. This information weakens the claim that the image depicts American mercenaries, as the patches could be worn by anyone.

Without further evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim.
