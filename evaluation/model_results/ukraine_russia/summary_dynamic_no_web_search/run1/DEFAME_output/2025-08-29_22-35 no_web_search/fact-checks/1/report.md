### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the claim is false. A social media post from February 6, 2025, falsely claims Zelenskyy acquired the Kehlsteinhaus. A fact-check article explicitly states that Zelenskyy did not purchase the Eagle's Nest, which remains under the ownership of the Bavarian state.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The provided evidence includes a fact-check article that directly refutes the claim, stating that Zelenskyy did not purchase the Eagle's Nest.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest is false. A fact-check article explicitly states that Zelenskyy did not purchase the property, which remains under the ownership of the Bavarian state ([Source](https://cedmohub.eu/no-zelensky-hasnt-bought-eagles-nest-it-is-still-in-ownership-of-bavarian-state/)).
