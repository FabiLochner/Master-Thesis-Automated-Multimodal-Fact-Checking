Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2021/05/28/watching-fallen-troops-be-loaded-on-to-airplanes-has-dramatically-shaped-my-view-of-memorial-day/):

The claim '<image:3> This image shows the coffins of 18 British Special Forces who were killed in November 2024 in the Odessa Region in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts coffins inside a C-17 aircraft, but the provided evidence does not support the claim that they belong to British Special Forces killed in the Odessa Region in Ukraine in November 2024. The search results show images of coffins being transported by C-17 planes, including repatriation ceremonies, but none of them match the specific details of the claim. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
