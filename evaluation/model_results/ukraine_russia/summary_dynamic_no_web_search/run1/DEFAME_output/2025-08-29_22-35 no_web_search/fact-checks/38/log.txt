The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met with Kamala Harris and visited Pennsylvania, there is no evidence to support the claim that he campaigned for her in Pennsylvania ahead of the 2024 US presidential election. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
