The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Warren Buffett's son, Howard Buffett, has donated $500 million to Ukraine, there is no evidence to support the claim that Warren Buffett has personally donated more than that amount. The evidence, including a Business Insider article ([https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/howard-buffett-gives-500-million-to-ukraine)), focuses on Howard Buffett's contributions, not Warren Buffett's.

So, the overall veracity is: false
