## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. According to a Le Monde article, Biden pledged to aid victims of Hurricane Helene. The evidence does not mention any announcement about stopping aid for the affected areas.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim that he announced no further aid. The search results do not support the claim that Biden announced no more aid for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene and instead pledged aid.

`false`
