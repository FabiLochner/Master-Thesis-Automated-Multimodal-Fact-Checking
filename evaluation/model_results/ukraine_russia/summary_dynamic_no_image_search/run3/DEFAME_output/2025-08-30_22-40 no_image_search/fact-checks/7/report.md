## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including The Asia Fact Check Lab ([https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/afcl/afcl-blackrock-ukraine-land-08262024030948.html)) and Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/ukrainian-lands-and-banned-the-burial-of-military-personnel/)), have fact-checked the claim and found it to be untrue. The claim originated from a Bulgarian politician and a satirical Telegram channel.

The evidence also indicates that foreign companies are prohibited from purchasing arable land in Ukraine. BlackRock's involvement in Ukraine is related to the Ukraine Reconstruction Fund, as announced by Larry Fink.
