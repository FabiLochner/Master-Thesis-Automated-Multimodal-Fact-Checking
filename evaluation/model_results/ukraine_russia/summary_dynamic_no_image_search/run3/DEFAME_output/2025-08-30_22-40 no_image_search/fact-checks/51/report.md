## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Euronews published a fact-check on February 19, 2025, stating that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany due to US peace negotiations with Russia. The article clarifies that Scholz referred to "Notlage," an urgent situation, not a state of emergency. ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) POLITICO reports that Olaf Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.

Reuters published an article on February 17, 2025, reporting on a meeting of European leaders in Paris where they discussed increasing defense spending and the possible deployment of peacekeepers to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that deploying peacekeepers was "completely premature and completely the wrong time to have this discussion now."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Kyiv Independent published an article on August 30, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's plans to send US private military companies to secure a Ukraine peace deal, including Chinese peacekeepers and Turkey's participation (<image:k>). NPR published an article on August 10, 2025, about a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, with European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, urging for Ukraine to be included in the talks (<image:k>).

Reuters published an article on August 13, 2025, discussing a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine, mentioning a virtual conference with European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (![image 10030](media/2025-08-30_22-51-1756594310-390992.jpg)). The article also mentions Trump threatening "severe consequences" if Putin blocks peace.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. According to a Euronews fact-check, Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025. Instead, he referred to an "urgent situation." Furthermore, POLITICO reports that Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine. The evidence also shows that in August 2025, there were discussions about Trump's plans for peace in Ukraine, including meetings with Putin and European leaders, but the claim refers to February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025, and he was also unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan at that time. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate. `false`
