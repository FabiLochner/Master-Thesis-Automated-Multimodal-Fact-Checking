## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in question, ![image 21](media/69.jpg), appears on the Wikipedia article "East Slavic name" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)) and on the Wikimedia Commons ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)). The Wikimedia Commons source describes the image as a Russian internal passport. The image also appears on a website discussing Russian internal passports ([https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/](https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article from January 8, 2025, fact-checks the claim that the image shows Bashar al-Assad's Russian passport and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article discusses Bashar al-Assad's presidency, including the Russian intervention in 2015, which helped his regime regain control over most of the country by 2021. It mentions the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives, which led to Assad fleeing to Moscow and being granted political asylum. The article from NV.ua discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports. The article also mentions that Bashar al-Assad's regime collapsed and he fled to Moscow.

## Elaboration
The image is a photoshopped Russian internal passport. An AOL fact-check article from January 8, 2025, confirms the image is fake. The original image is from Wikipedia and is described as a Russian internal passport.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows an authentic Russian passport of Bashar al-Assad is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL fact-check, confirm that the image is photoshopped and not authentic. The original image is a Russian internal passport.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
