Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit): 
Content: The 2024 G20 Rio de Janeiro summit will be held from 18â€“19 November 2024. The summit will be hosted in Brazil, with the theme "Building a Just World and a Sustainable Planet". The main agenda priorities are social inclusion, energy transition, and reform of global governance institutions. The summit will include the participation of G20 members, invited states, and international bodies. Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy, is listed as a participant. The article mentions that Vladimir Putin announced he will not attend the summit.

The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, as confirmed by a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)), there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. An Anadolu Agency report indicates that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
