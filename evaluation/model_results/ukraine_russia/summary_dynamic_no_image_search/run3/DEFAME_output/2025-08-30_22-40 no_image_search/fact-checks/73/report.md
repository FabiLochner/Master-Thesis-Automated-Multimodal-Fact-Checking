## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base, Calif., in May 2019. The crash was caused by a loss of hydraulic pressure due to improperly installed parts. The pilot ejected and survived. The Press-Enterprise published an article on May 1, 2020, about the crash, which included the same photo of the crashed F-16 inside a warehouse.

### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/europe/ukraine-f-16-pilot-killed-russia)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ukraine-loses-16-fighter-amid-massed-russian-drone/story?id=123315001)) reported on June 29, 2025, that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet was lost during a Russian attack, resulting in the death of the pilot. ABC News also mentioned that Russia launched 537 drones and missiles into Ukraine overnight.

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/least-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29/](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/least-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29/)) also reported on June 29, 2025, that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack. The article also states that Ukraine has lost three F-16s since it began operating the jets last year. <image:k>, ![image 9769](media/2025-08-30_22-28-1756592935-410176.jpg), ![image 9765](media/2025-08-30_22-28-1756592932-460825.jpg), ![image 9774](media/2025-08-30_22-29-1756592940-680663.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image in the claim (![image 22](media/73.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is of an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not as a result of the Russian invasion. While there have been reports of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in the conflict, the image is not related to those events.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, as reported by the Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)). While there have been reports of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in the conflict, the image is not related to those events.
