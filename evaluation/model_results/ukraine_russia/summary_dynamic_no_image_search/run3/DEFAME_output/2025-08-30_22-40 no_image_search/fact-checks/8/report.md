## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from April 17, 2025, discusses the capture of Chinese nationals fighting on the Russian side in Ukraine. <image:i> The Guardian published an article on May 9, 2025, discussing the Victory Day parade in Moscow, where Chinese troops marched with Russian forces. ![image 3184](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859927-854750.jpg), ![image 3185](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859929-160325.jpg), ![image 3188](media/2025-08-22_10-52-1755859931-762213.jpg)

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross published a report on the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement's response to the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The report mentions the involvement of the Red Cross Society of China.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim was found on Wikipedia, which discusses airliners, including their history, types, and features, such as engines and cabin configurations. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner)) <image:k> The image was also found on the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum website, which discusses the evolution of commercial airliners. ([https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner](https://airandspace.si.edu/explore/stories/evolution-commercial-airliner)) ![image 6](media/8.jpg)

Additionally, the image was found on Merriam-Webster, which defines the word "airliner." ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airliner))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Red Cross Society of China is involved in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, the reverse image search indicates that the image in the claim is related to airliners and does not provide any information about the Chinese Red Cross troops. The claim also mentions that the troops are setting off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories, which is not supported by the evidence.

The evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Chinese Red Cross troops. The image is related to airliners. The claim also states that the troops are going to the front, which is not supported by the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image is related to airliners and not Chinese Red Cross troops. While the Red Cross Society of China is involved in the conflict, the image does not support the claim. The claim also states that the troops are going to the front, which is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the Red Cross Society of China is involved in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the image provided is related to airliners and does not depict Chinese Red Cross troops. The claim's assertion that the troops are heading to the front is also unsupported by the evidence.
