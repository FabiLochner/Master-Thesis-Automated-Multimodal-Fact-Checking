## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. The evidence confirms that a man, Nikita Zhuravel, was sentenced in November 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the 14-year sentence was not solely for burning the Quran. It was for treason, with the Quran burning being a separate offense. The Reuters and Moscow Times articles state that the 14-year sentence was for treason, while the Quran burning resulted in a separate sentence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. While a man was sentenced in November 2024, the 14-year sentence was for treason, not solely for burning the Quran. The Quran burning was a separate offense.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
