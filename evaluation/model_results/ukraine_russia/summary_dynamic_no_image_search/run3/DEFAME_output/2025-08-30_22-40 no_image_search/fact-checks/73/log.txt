Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/least-six-wounded-large-scale-russian-air-attack-ukraine-ukrainian-authorities-2025-06-29/): 
Content: Reuters reports that a Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack. Ukraine has lost three F-16s since it began operating the jets last year. <image:9774> The article was published on June 29, 2025.

The claim '<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of an F-16 that crashed in 2019 due to mechanical failure, as reported by the Press-Enterprise ([https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/05/01/heres-why-the-missiles-on-the-crashed-f-16-near-march-air-reserve-base-did-not-explode/)). While there have been reports of Ukrainian F-16s being lost in the conflict, the image is not related to those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
