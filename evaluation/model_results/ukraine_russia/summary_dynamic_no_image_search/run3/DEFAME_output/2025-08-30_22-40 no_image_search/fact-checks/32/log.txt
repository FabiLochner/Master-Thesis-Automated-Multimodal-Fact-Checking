Useful result: From [Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-trump-and-harris-handle-the-russia-ukraine-war/): 
Content: The Brookings article, published on October 1, 2024, discusses how Trump and Harris would handle the Russia-Ukraine war. It mentions that Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine militarily, economically, and politically, and maintaining sanctions on Russia. The article also references a CBS News article where Harris promised to stand strong with Ukraine and NATO allies. <image:2002>

The claim 'U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris once said, 'Ukraine is a country in Europe. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. So basically that's wrong.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. Kamala Harris did say, "Ukraine is a country in Europe. Russia decided to invade a smaller country called Ukraine. It exists next to another country called Russia. Russia is a bigger country. Russia is a powerful country," as evidenced by IMDb.com ([Source](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3668431/quotes/)). However, the claim also includes the phrase "So basically that's wrong," which is not found in the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
