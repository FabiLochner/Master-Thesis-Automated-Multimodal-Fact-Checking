## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on November 19, 2024, discussing the G20 summit in Brazil, which was criticized for not highlighting Russia's invasion of Ukraine; Giorgia Meloni was not mentioned in the article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique)). Anadolu Agency reported on November 19, 2024, that Giorgia Meloni said she understands the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy has made a different choice (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

The 2024 G20 Rio de Janeiro summit will be held from 18â€“19 November 2024, with Giorgia Meloni listed as a participant ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)).


## Elaboration
Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. While Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. The Guardian article about the summit does not mention Meloni. However, an Anadolu Agency report indicates that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy has made a different choice.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. However, the provided sources do not confirm that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. One source suggests she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia, but Italy has made a different choice.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, as confirmed by a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)), there is no evidence to support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia. An Anadolu Agency report indicates that Meloni expressed understanding of the US's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles inside Russia.
