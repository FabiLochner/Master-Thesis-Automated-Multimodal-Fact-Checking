Content: PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

The audit did not attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales): 
Content: The search result from Trading Economics provides data on Ukraine's weapons sales. Weapons Sales in Ukraine decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024 from 29 SIPRI TIV Million in 2023. Weapons Sales in Ukraine averaged 388.15 SIPRI TIV Million from 1992 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 1495.00 SIPRI TIV Million in 2012 and a record low of 23.00 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024. The data is from SIPRI. The indicator aims to represent the transfer value of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/): 
Content: Statista, in cooperation with SIPRI, published a report in March 2025, showing arms imports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024. <image:10080> The report does not provide any information about the percentage of arms being sold by Ukraine. <image:10081>, <image:10082>

The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of corruption and missing military assets in Ukraine, and the country is a major importer of arms, there is no data on the percentage of arms being sold. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
