## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's involvement in negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, including a meeting with Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, and potential security guarantees for Ukraine (![image 4898](media/2025-08-28_15-35-1756395339-850858.jpg)). Wikipedia mentions a timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including January 2025 – May 2025 and June 2025 – present, and that Trump began pushing for peace negotiations in December 2024, after winning the U.S. presidential election, and also links to a "2025 Putin–Trump call". CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia (![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg), ![image 5](media/6.jpg)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
A timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine from January 1 to May 31, 2025, details various attacks and military actions, including drone strikes, airstrikes, and territorial shifts. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(1_January_2025_%E2%80%93_31_May_2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(1_January_2025_%E2%80%93_31_May_2025))

PBS News published a timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine on August 18, 2025, which includes events from 2022 to 2025. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine)) The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an assessment on August 24, 2025, discussing the ongoing war, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's rejection of US-proposed peace initiatives and continued military aid to Ukraine. ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025)) ![image 9607](media/2025-08-30_22-16-1756592179-976810.jpg) ![image 9608](media/2025-08-30_22-16-1756592184-933011.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. The Guardian and CNN articles from August 2025 discuss ongoing negotiations and the distinction between a ceasefire and a peace deal. Furthermore, the Institute for the Study of War's assessment from August 24, 2025, indicates that the war was still ongoing, with Russia rejecting peace initiatives. The timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine also details military actions through May 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, but a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. Multiple sources, including The Guardian, CNN, and the Institute for the Study of War, confirm that the war was still ongoing and that negotiations were in progress.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. Articles from August 2025, such as those from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-ukraine-russia-peace-talks)) and CNN, discuss ongoing negotiations and the distinction between a ceasefire and a peace deal. Additionally, the Institute for the Study of War's assessment ([https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-24-2025)) from August 24, 2025, indicates that the war was still ongoing.
