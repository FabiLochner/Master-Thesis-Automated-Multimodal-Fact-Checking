## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Benjamin Netanyahu met with Donald Trump at the White House on April 7, 2025, according to reports from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump)) and ABC7 ([https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/](https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/)). The meetings focused on the war in Gaza and potential ceasefire deals.

The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Netanyahu's visit, focusing on Trump's tariffs, negotiations with Iran, and TÃ¼rkiye-Israel relations ([https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-april-9/)). The Intelbrief does not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. ![image 5288](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461862-739066.jpg), ![image 5289](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461864-391400.jpg), ![image 5295](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461875-496107.jpg), ![image 5302](media/2025-08-29_10-04-1756461879-793481.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article from August 8, 2025, discusses Israel's plan to take control of Gaza City, which has been condemned by world leaders and the UN. The article mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News that Israel planned to occupy the entire Gaza Strip and eventually "hand it over to Arab forces" (![image 5340](media/2025-08-29_10-21-1756462906-461320.jpg), ![image 5341](media/2025-08-29_10-21-1756462906-772058.jpg), ![image 5343](media/2025-08-29_10-21-1756462907-426713.jpg)).

PBS News published an article on August 10, 2025, discussing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defense of a military offensive in Gaza (![image 5346](media/2025-08-29_10-21-1756462913-192119.jpg)). The Times of Israel's live blog from August 28, 2025, reports on a White House meeting on the future of Gaza, where US President Donald Trump discussed Israel's needs for the "day after" Hamas. The live blog also mentions Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with Druze leaders and saying he ordered the use of military force in Syria.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Benjamin Netanyahu met with Donald Trump at the White House in April 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during this visit.

Later reports from August 2025 discuss Israel's plans for Gaza, including taking control of Gaza City and handing it over to Arab forces. There is also mention of a White House meeting on the future of Gaza.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention the resettlement plan.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Benjamin Netanyahu did meet with Donald Trump at the White House in April 2025, there is no mention of plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during that visit. Later reports discuss Israel's plans for Gaza, but not the resettlement plan.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Benjamin Netanyahu met with Donald Trump at the White House in April 2025, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/g-s1-76296/israel-netanyahu-meet-trump)) and ABC7 ([https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/](https://abc7.com/post/trump-netanyahu-may-take-victory-lap-iran-gaza-war-looms-meeting/17007239/)), there is no evidence from the provided sources to support the claim that he announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.
