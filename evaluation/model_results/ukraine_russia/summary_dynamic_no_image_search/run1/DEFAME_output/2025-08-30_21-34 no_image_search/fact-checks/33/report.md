### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss a Fox News broadcast error during an Easter service on April 20, 2025, where Kyiv was incorrectly labeled as a Russian city.

The error was displayed for about 20 minutes before being corrected, and Ukraine requested an apology and investigation from Fox News. The broadcast included footage of an Easter service in Moscow attended by Vladimir Putin, with Patriarch Kirill presiding.
