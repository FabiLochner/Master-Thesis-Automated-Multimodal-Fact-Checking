Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/london-holds-significant-summit-to-address-russo-ukrainian-war/): 
Content: The Ukrainian World Congress website published an article about the London Summit on March 3, 2025. The summit was held on March 2, 2025, and hosted by Keir Starmer. The summit was attended by leaders from 18 countries, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mark Rutte, and Ursula von der Leyen.

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image is authentic and depicts the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/zelensky-trump-europe-summit-starmer](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/zelensky-trump-europe-summit-starmer), [https://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/london-holds-significant-summit-to-address-russo-ukrainian-war/](https://www.ukrainianworldcongress.org/london-holds-significant-summit-to-address-russo-ukrainian-war/)). However, there is no evidence to support the claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
