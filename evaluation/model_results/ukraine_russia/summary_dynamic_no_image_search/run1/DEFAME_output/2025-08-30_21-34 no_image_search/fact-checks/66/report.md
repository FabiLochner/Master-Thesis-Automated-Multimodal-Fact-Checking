## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan, in 1945, resulting in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) Leaked Russian military documents reveal plans to target 160 sites in Japan and South Korea, including civilian infrastructure ![image 3874](media/2025-08-22_23-55-1755906949-169265.jpg).

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation. The provided sources mention a historical invasion by the Soviet Union into Japan's puppet state, leaked Russian military plans to target sites in Japan, and joint naval patrols between Russia and China. There is no information about a planned invasion of Russia by China or Japan.

The evidence suggests that Russia is planning to target Japan.


## Final Judgement
The evidence does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade Russia. The search results mention historical events and current military plans that do not include an invasion of Russia by China or Japan.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The search results reveal that the Soviet Union invaded Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan, in 1945 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)), and that Russia has plans to target sites in Japan ([https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3293037/russias-uncovered-secret-war-plans-target-160-sites-japan-and-south-korea)). However, there is no evidence of a planned invasion of Russia by China or Japan.
