The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian enemies hit list is not supported by the evidence. While it is confirmed that White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025, the official investigation, as reported by the Austin American-Statesman ([Source](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/crime/2025/03/11/austin-police-say-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-possibly-killed-by-car-burglars/82265844007/)), suggests he was killed by car burglars, and there is no evidence to support the claim of a Ukrainian hit list.

So, the overall veracity is: false
