Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trumps-lies-about-zelensky-and-ukraine): 
Content: The CNN article, written by Daniel Dale and published on February 19, 2025, fact-checks Donald Trump's claims about Zelensky and Ukraine. The article states that Zelensky said in a February 1 interview with the Associated Press that Ukraine had received about $76 billion in U.S. aid, largely in the form of weapons, and that he doesnâ€™t know where all the professed additional money has gone. <image:9227>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy did state in a February 1, 2025, AP interview that Ukraine had received only a portion of the U.S. aid, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/politics/fact-check-trumps-lies-about-zelensky-and-ukraine), this statement does not confirm that the aid is a money laundering operation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
