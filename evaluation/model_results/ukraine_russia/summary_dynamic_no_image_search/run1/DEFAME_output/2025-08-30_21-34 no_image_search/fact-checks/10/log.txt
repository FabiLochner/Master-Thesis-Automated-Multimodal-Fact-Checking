Content: The Voice of America published an article on July 8, 2024, about a Russian missile attack on Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv, Ukraine. The article includes multiple images of the aftermath of the attack, showing the damaged hospital and rescuers at the scene. <image:8892>, <image:8893>, <image:8894>, <image:8895>.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows fake children's toys that were photoshopped into the image by the Ukrainian Government after Kyiv's pediatric hospital was attacked by Russian cruise missiles on July 8, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows photoshopped toys is not supported by the evidence. While the image depicts toys amidst the rubble of a hospital, there is no evidence to suggest they were photoshopped. The attack on the Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, is confirmed by multiple sources, but none of the provided images validate the claim of manipulation. Therefore, the claim is rated as false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
