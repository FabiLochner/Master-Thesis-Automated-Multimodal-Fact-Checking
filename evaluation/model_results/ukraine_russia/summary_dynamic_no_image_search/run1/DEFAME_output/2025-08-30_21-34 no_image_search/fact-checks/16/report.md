Euractiv ([https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/zelenskyy-seeks-diplomatic-end-to-russias-war-floats-role-for-foreign-troops/](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/zelenskyy-seeks-diplomatic-end-to-russias-war-floats-role-for-foreign-troops/)) reported that Zelenskyy said he would ask Biden to invite him to NATO and that there was no point in talking to Trump. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/)) also reported on the press conference, stating Zelenskyy said, "And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House." <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports on the Trump administration providing Ukraine with "deeper strike capabilities" and mentions engagement with Russian and Ukrainian officials ([https://www.newsweek.com/trump-giving-ukraine-capability-strike-deeper-russia-nato-ambassador-2122053](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-giving-ukraine-capability-strike-deeper-russia-nato-ambassador-2122053)). The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) discusses a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at a NATO summit in 2025 ([https://www.cfr.org/article/trump-and-zelenskyy-meet-sidelines-nato-summit](https://www.cfr.org/article/trump-and-zelenskyy-meet-sidelines-nato-summit)).

The BBC published an article on August 18, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's statements regarding Ukraine and NATO, including a meeting at the White House ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21j1ve817o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21j1ve817o)). ![image 8964](media/2025-08-30_21-39-1756589971-045373.jpg), ![image 8969](media/2025-08-30_21-39-1756589979-402655.jpg), ![image 8970](media/2025-08-30_21-39-1756589979-770158.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including Euractiv ([https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/zelenskyy-seeks-diplomatic-end-to-russias-war-floats-role-for-foreign-troops/](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/zelenskyy-seeks-diplomatic-end-to-russias-war-floats-role-for-foreign-troops/)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/)), confirm that Zelenskyy stated he would ask Biden to invite him to NATO during a press conference on December 9, 2024.

The evidence also supports the second part of the claim. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-floats-idea-deploying-foreign-troops-ukraine-before-nato-membership-2024-12-09/)) reported Zelenskyy's statement that there was no point in discussing with Trump "while he is not yet in the White House."


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Zelenskyy made the statements attributed to him in the claim during a press conference on December 9, 2024. He stated he would ask Biden to invite him to NATO and that there was no point in talking to Trump.
