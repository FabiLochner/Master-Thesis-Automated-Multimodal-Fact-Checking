## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, articles from Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-peace-over-heads-ukrainians-europeans-says-german-foreign-minister-2025-02-14/)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire)) discussed German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock's statements regarding the situation in Ukraine. Baerbock stated that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in negotiations and that there must be no peace over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans.

A Wikipedia article ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) mentions a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, where Baerbock described Trump's conduct as a "new era of ruthlessness". ![image 1](media/0.jpg) ![image 1007](media/2025-08-06_18-20-1754504425-007992.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a fact-check published on March 4, 2025, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to cut diplomatic ties with the United States. The fact-check, available on [aol.com](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html), references a Facebook post claiming Baerbock threatened to cut ties with the US over Ukraine. ![image 9199](media/2025-08-30_21-53-1756590830-185221.jpg) The article quotes Baerbock saying, "We are increasing the pressure on the Americans so that they have as much to lose as possible if they no longer stand by the side of the liberal democracies of Europe.” ![image 9198](media/2025-08-30_21-53-1756590830-021957.jpg)

Politico reported on February 28, 2025, that Baerbock warned of a "new era of ruthlessness" following Donald Trump's public humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The remarks were made in a speech on Saturday in the Foreign Ministry. [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/annalena-baerbock-europe-leadership-against-donald-trump-ruthlessness-ukraine/)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Annalena Baerbock did not threaten to sever ties with the US in February 2025. A fact-check from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-germany-did-not-142747218.html)) explicitly states this.

However, Baerbock did make strong statements regarding the US's stance on Ukraine. She warned of a "new era of ruthlessness" following a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, as reported by Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/annalena-baerbock-europe-leadership-against-donald-trump-ruthlessness-ukraine/](https://www.politico.eu/article/annalena-baerbock-europe-leadership-against-donald-trump-ruthlessness-ukraine/)). She also stated that pressure was being increased on the Americans.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Annalena Baerbock made critical statements about the US's stance on Ukraine and Trump's actions, she did not threaten to sever ties with the US. The evidence includes a fact-check from aol.com explicitly denying the claim.
