## Elaboration
Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. According to the Anadolu Agency, she stated that she understood the US's decision to allow Ukraine to strike inside Russia, but Italy had made a different choice.

The Guardian's article about the summit did not mention Meloni. The evidence does not support the claim that Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While she commented on the US's decision regarding Ukraine striking inside Russia, the evidence does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Giorgia Meloni attended the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024, where she commented on the US's decision regarding Ukraine striking inside Russia, but the evidence from the [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/ukraine-russia-g20-communique) does not support the claim that she condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia.
