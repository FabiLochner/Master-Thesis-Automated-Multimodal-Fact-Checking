## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
One article from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html)) fact-checks the claim and states it is false, as the Free State of Bavaria still owns the Kehlsteinhaus. Another article ([https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/02/08/zelensky-bought-hitlers-eagles-nest-residence-in-the-bavarian-alps-mass-media](https://eadaily.com/en/news/2025/02/08/zelensky-bought-hitlers-eagles-nest-residence-in-the-bavarian-alps-mass-media)) claims Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million.

A third article ([https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-zelenskyy-didnt-buy-villa-on-island-of-billionaires/](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-zelenskyy-didnt-buy-villa-on-island-of-billionaires/)) debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthélemy island, stating the evidence is fake. ![image 1524](media/2025-08-07_18-47-1754592456-339264.jpg), ![image 1548](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592484-932343.jpg), ![image 1552](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592492-084293.jpg), ![image 1553](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592495-928314.jpg), ![image 1554](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592496-123937.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The website for the Eagle's Nest (Kehlsteinhaus) in Berchtesgaden provides information about the building's history, opening times, and how to get there. It also mentions that the Bavarian government relinquished control of the building to a trust in 1960, and includes images of the building and its surroundings (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

Another source states that the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for 14.2 million euros is false, as the property is still owned by the state of Bavaria. The source includes a screenshot of a Facebook post making the false claim (![image 8889](media/2025-08-30_21-37-1756589843-349620.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million is false. Multiple sources, including a fact-check from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html)), state that the Free State of Bavaria still owns the Kehlsteinhaus. Another source confirms the claim is false and includes a screenshot of a Facebook post making the false claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria, not Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy purchased the property is inaccurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest is false. Fact-checkers, such as the one from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-didn-151251133.html)), confirm that the property is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria.
