## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Euronews explicitly states that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025. Furthermore, POLITICO reports that Scholz was unaware of Trump's peace plan. While Trump was indeed working on a peace plan for Ukraine, there is no evidence to suggest that Scholz declared a state of emergency in response to it.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025. Additionally, there is no evidence linking any such declaration to Donald Trump's peace plan. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to a Euronews fact-check, Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in February 2025. Furthermore, POLITICO reports that Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine.
