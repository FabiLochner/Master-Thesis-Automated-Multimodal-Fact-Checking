## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). A Wikipedia article mentions that a British Army official said in July 2024 that Russia could suffer 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. It also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died, and as of early February 2025, 1,382 missing Russian servicemen were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides information on Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, based on December 2024 data. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not accurate. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. A Wikipedia article from July 2024 mentions a British Army official estimating 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, the claim states 1.5 million *lost* troops, which is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence provides figures for killed, injured, missing, and captured soldiers, but not a total loss figure that matches the claim.

The evidence also provides different estimates from various sources, including Meduza and Mediazona, which further complicates the verification of the claim. The Meduza estimate of over 165,000 deaths by the end of 2024 is significantly lower than the claim.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence provides different figures for casualties, but not a single figure for total losses that matches the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence provides estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, including killed, injured, missing, and captured soldiers. However, the claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence provides different estimates from various sources, but none of them match the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While various sources provide estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, including killed, injured, missing, and captured soldiers, none of the provided figures match the claim of 1.5 million lost troops as of February 2025. For example, a [Russia Matters article](https://www.example.com) estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, and a Wikipedia article mentions a British Army official estimating 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, but these figures do not directly equate to the claim's specific number of lost troops.
