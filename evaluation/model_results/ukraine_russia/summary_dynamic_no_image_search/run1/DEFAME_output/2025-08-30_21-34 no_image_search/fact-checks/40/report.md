## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Elon Musk made several statements on X in February 2025 regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, none of the provided sources mention Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. Instead, the evidence shows Musk questioning Zelenskyy's popularity, accusing him of being despised by Ukrainians, and claiming Zelenskyy killed an American journalist.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Elon Musk made several statements about Volodymyr Zelenskyy on X in February 2025, but none of them mention Musk planning to suspend Zelenskyy's X account. The evidence focuses on Musk's criticism of Zelenskyy.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results reveal that in February 2025, Elon Musk made several statements on X regarding Volodymyr Zelenskyy, including questioning his popularity and making accusations against him. However, the provided evidence from sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/2/21/musk-vows-to-fix-x-after-polls-show-high-support-for-ukraines-zelenskyy), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-x-ukraine-trump-zelensky-b2702216.html), and [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/elon-musk-claims-ukrainian-president-killed-an-american-journalist/3487351) do not support the claim that Musk planned to suspend Zelenskyy's X account.
