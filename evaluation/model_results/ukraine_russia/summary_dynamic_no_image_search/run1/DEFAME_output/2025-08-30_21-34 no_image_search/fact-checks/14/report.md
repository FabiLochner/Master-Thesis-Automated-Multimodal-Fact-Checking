## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from Gwara Media debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID, stating that the claim originated from a Telegram channel that spreads Russian disinformation. The article provides a screenshot of the alleged Fox News article ![image 11](media/14.jpg) and notes that the article is absent from the list of Aubrie Spady’s publications on the official Fox News website. The article also mentions that USAID provided $6.05 billion to Ukraine in 2024.
