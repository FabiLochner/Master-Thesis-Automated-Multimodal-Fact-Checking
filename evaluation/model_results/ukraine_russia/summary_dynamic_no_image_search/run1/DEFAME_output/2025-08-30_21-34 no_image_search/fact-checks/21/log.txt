Justification: While Claudia Sheinbaum did decline an invitation to visit Ukraine, as reported by multiple sources ([IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/), [Euromaidan Press](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/), and [NV.ua](https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-focuses-on-domestic-issues-50451798.html/)), there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to her.

So, the overall veracity is: false
