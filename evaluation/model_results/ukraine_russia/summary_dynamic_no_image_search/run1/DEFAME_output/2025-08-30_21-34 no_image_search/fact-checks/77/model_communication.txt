**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".

The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:25>)
web_search("military parade Poland August 14 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Polish Armed Forces Day, celebrated on August 15th, which includes military parades and showcases. One source mentions a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration, showcasing military hardware. Another source mentions flypasts on August 14th and 15th.

The sources are:
*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed\_Forces\_Day\_(Poland)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland))
*   [https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)
*   [https://www.europeanairshows.co.uk/news/polish-air-force-flypasts](https://www.europeanairshows.co.uk/news/polish-air-force-flypasts)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Poland celebrated Armed Forces Day on August 15th, 2024, with a military parade. The parade was part of a four-day celebration. Flypasts were scheduled for August 14th and 15th.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024. While the evidence confirms military events around that date, it does not explicitly confirm the image's context.

To verify the claim, information is missing about the specific event depicted in the image and whether it was indeed a military parade on August 14, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Polish Armed Forces Day, celebrated on August 15th, which includes military parades and showcases. One source mentions a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of a four-day celebration, showcasing military hardware. Another source mentions flypasts on August 14th and 15th.

The sources are:
*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed\_Forces\_Day\_(Poland)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day_(Poland))
*   [https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)
*   [https://www.europeanairshows.co.uk/news/polish-air-force-flypasts](https://www.europeanairshows.co.uk/news/polish-air-force-flypasts)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Poland celebrated Armed Forces Day on August 15th, 2024, with a military parade. The parade was part of a four-day celebration. Flypasts were scheduled for August 14th and 15th.

The claim states the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024. While the evidence confirms military events around that date, it does not explicitly confirm the image's context.

To verify the claim, information is missing about the specific event depicted in the image and whether it was indeed a military parade on August 14, 2024.
