The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While there were reports of a fire and explosion involving one of Putin's limousines, there is no evidence to support the claim that he died. Furthermore, multiple sources, including the Kremlin's official website, the BBC, and The Guardian, confirm that Putin has been making public appearances recently, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
