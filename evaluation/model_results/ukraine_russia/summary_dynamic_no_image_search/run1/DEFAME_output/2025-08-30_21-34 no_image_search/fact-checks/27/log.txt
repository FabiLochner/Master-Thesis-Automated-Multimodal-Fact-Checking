Useful result: From [Source](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle): 
Content: The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers investigation found that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky's current chief aide, Serhiy Shefir, as well as the head of the country’s Security Service, were part of the offshore network. Offshore companies were used by Shefir and another business partner to buy pricey London real estate. Around the time of his 2019 election, Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Shefir, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelensky’s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:i>. The article also mentions that during the 2019 election, a pro-Poroshenko member of parliament claimed that Zelensky and his partners were the beneficiaries of an offshore network of companies that received $41 million in payments that originated from Privatbank.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-publishes-income-part-transparency-drive-2024-01-28/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on January 28, 2024, stating that Volodymyr Zelenskiy made his income public as part of a transparency drive. The article mentions that Zelenskiy's income declined in 2021 and 2022. <image:9021>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-zelenskyy-is-embezzling-huge-sums-of-money-from-military-budget-financial-times/): 
Content: The search result from StopFake.org debunks a video claiming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy stole $770 million from the Ukrainian military budget, citing a Financial Times article. The article does not accuse Zelenskyy of embezzlement. The article discusses cases where Ukraine did not receive weapons it had ordered and paid for. <image:9022>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Fact-checks from sources like [Mythdetector.com](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) and The Times of India indicate that Zelenskyy's net worth is significantly less than the claimed figures, and his assets do not include the specific properties and income mentioned. While he has offshore connections, as revealed by the [OCCRP](https://www.occrp.org/en/project/the-pandora-papers/pandora-papers-reveal-offshore-holdings-of-ukrainian-president-and-his-inner-circle), the claim's specific details are not supported by evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
