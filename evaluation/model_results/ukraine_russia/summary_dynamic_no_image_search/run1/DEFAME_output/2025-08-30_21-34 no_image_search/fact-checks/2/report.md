NPR published an article on February 28, 2025, discussing a contentious meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office (![image 1572](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592644-705128.jpg), ![image 1569](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592639-153450.jpg), ![image 1570](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592640-602508.jpg)). Trump criticized Zelenskyy's gratitude for U.S. support and later posted on Truth Social that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Reuters published an article on February 19, 2025, reporting on the strained relationship between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump called Zelenskyy a "dictator" and suggested he was prolonging the war. Zelenskyy accused Trump of spreading Russian disinformation (![image 1573](media/2025-08-07_18-50-1754592657-229427.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence does not contain any information about Zelenskyy blocking access to Truth Social in Ukraine. The evidence shows that Trump and Zelenskyy had a strained relationship and that Trump used Truth Social to criticize Zelenskyy.
