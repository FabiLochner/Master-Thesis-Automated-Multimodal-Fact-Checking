Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/5/what-is-ukraines-new-peace-plan-that-zelenskyy-presented-to-trump): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on March 5, 2025, discusses the London summit on Ukraine, which took place on March 2, 2025. The article mentions the summit's goal of strengthening support for Ukraine and includes a photo of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The article does not mention leaders taking off their jackets or suits. <image:9458>, <image:9459>, <image:1760>, <image:1761>

The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that European leaders took off their suits to support Ukraine at the London summit on March 2, 2025, is not supported by the evidence. While the summit did occur, and images from the event are available, none of the images show leaders removing their suits. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
