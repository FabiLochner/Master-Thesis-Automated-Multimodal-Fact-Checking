The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Polish military parade that occurred on August 15, 2024, as reported by the Associated Press and Polish Radio, not on August 14 as the claim states. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and showcased military hardware. While the parade was described as a display of strength, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was specifically preparing for war with Russia.
