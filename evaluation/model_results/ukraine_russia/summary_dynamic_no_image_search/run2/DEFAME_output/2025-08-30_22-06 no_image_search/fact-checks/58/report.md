## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." The story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel and was later reposted without any mention of it being a joke. There is zero evidence to support this claim. ![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg), ![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)

The claim is part of a disinformation campaign based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires.
