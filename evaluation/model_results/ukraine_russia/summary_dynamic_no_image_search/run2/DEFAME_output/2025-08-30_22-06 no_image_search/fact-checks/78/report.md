## Claim
Claim: "![image 26](media/78.jpg) This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 26](media/78.jpg))
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks destroyed")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks ![image 2767](media/2025-08-07_21-11-1754601064-235630.jpg), ![image 2768](media/2025-08-07_21-11-1754601064-852129.jpg), ![image 2769](media/2025-08-07_21-11-1754601071-722574.jpg), and ![image 2776](media/2025-08-07_21-11-1754601078-976522.jpg).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. ![image 26](media/78.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Actions
```
web_search("Kursk Oblast tank identification")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article about the Battle of Kursk in 1943, which does not mention the claim. The article also includes a Forbes article ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/01/17/to-cross-rivers-in-kursk-russia-reinvented-world-war-ii-funny-tanks/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/01/17/to-cross-rivers-in-kursk-russia-reinvented-world-war-ii-funny-tanks/)) discussing the use of modified BTR-D air assault vehicles by Russian airborne troops in the Kursk Oblast and mentions Ukrainian forces' incursion in August. ![image 26](media/78.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was a military conflict in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, involving Ukrainian and Russian forces. The Forbes article mentions the use of modified BTR-D air assault vehicles by Russian forces. However, the evidence does not explicitly identify the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image search and web searches confirm that there was a military conflict in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, involving Ukrainian and Russian forces, and that military equipment was destroyed. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. The type of tanks in the image cannot be determined.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While the evidence confirms a military conflict in the Kursk Oblast in August 2024, involving destroyed military equipment, it does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. The type of tanks in the image cannot be determined based on the available information. The search results mention the use of modified BTR-D air assault vehicles by Russian forces in the area, but do not identify the tanks in the image.
