## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Russia Matters article dated February 26, 2025, over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing (<image:k>). A Wikipedia article on the casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War mentions that a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties would be needed to control four regions of Ukraine. The article also states that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died. As of early February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen previously missing were confirmed in Ukrainian captivity.

Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provided an estimate of Russian losses, with the last update of the Probate Registry estimate on February 24, 2025, reflecting data from December 2024. By November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated that 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties would be needed to control four regions of Ukraine, the provided sources do not confirm that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops. The Russia Matters article states that over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. Additionally, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died by the end of 2024.

The evidence indicates that the number of casualties is high, but it does not support the specific figure of 1.5 million troops lost as of February 2025. The data from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides estimates up to December 2024, which is not aligned with the claim's timeframe.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses in February 2025 would be needed.


## Final Judgement
The provided sources offer estimates of Russian casualties in the Ukraine war, but they do not confirm the claim that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops as of February 2025. The evidence includes estimates of killed, injured, and missing soldiers, but the specific figure in the claim is not supported.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While sources like a [Russia Matters article](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025) and a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) provide estimates of casualties, including killed, injured, and missing soldiers, they do not confirm the specific figure of 1.5 million.
