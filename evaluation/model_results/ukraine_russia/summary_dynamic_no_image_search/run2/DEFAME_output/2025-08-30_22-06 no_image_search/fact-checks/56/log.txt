The claim '<image:17> This image shows Ben Stiller and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at their meeting on June 20, 2022, for which Stiller received $4 million from USAID.' is false.
Justification: The image accurately depicts Ben Stiller meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 20, 2022, as confirmed by multiple news sources like ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ben-stiller-meets-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-world-refugee/story?id=85517989)). However, the provided evidence does not support the assertion that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for this meeting.

So, the overall veracity is: false
