Useful result: From [Source](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025): 
Content: The search result from Russia Matters, dated February 26, 2025, provides estimates of Russian military casualties in the Ukraine war. It states that more than 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, according to a January 2025 estimate. <image:k> The article also mentions 48,000 missing.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that it would cost Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/01/casualties_eng-trl): 
Content: The search result from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides an estimate of Russian losses in the war with Ukraine. The last update of the Probate Registry estimate was February 24, 2025, with an estimate as of December 2024. The article also mentions that by November 2024, the number of losses among prisoners had dropped to between 2â€“3%.

The claim 'As of February 2025, Russia has lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops in the Ukraine war as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While sources like a [Russia Matters article](https://www.russiamatters.org/news/russia-ukraine-war-report-card/russia-ukraine-war-report-card-feb-26-2025) and a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War) provide estimates of casualties, including killed, injured, and missing soldiers, they do not confirm the specific figure of 1.5 million.

So, the overall veracity is: false
