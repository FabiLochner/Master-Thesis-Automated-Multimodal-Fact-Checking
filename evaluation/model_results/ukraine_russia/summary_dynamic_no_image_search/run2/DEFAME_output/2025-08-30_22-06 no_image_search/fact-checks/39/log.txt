Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on March 12, 2025, reports that InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 9, 2025, while interrupting a car burglary. <image:9579>. The suspects are at large. The article does not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.

The claim 'After InfoWars reporter Jamie White was shot dead on March 10, 2025 in Austin, Texas, it was revelaed that he was on a Ukranian enemies hit list.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is not supported by the evidence. While White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 9, 2025, the official investigation, as reported by [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965), does not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list.
