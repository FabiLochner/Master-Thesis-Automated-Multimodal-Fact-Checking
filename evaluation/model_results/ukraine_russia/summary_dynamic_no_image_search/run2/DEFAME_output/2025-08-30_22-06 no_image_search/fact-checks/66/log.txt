Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria): 
Content: The Soviet Union invaded the Empire of Japan's puppet state of Manchukuo on August 9, 1945, as part of World War II. The invasion, known as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, caught the Japanese by surprise. The Kwantung Army, the main Japanese force in the area, was unprepared. The Soviets employed a large-scale pincer movement, with the 2nd Far Eastern Front playing a supporting role. The Japanese forces, including the Kwantung Army, were overwhelmed. The Soviets captured Japanese soldiers and civilians, with many being sent to labor camps in Siberia. The invasion resulted in significant casualties and the collapse of Japanese control in the region.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported by the evidence. While there is evidence of historical conflicts, such as the Soviet invasion of Manchuria ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)), and current military cooperation between Russia and China, there is no evidence to suggest that China and Japan are planning to invade Russia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
