NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said Friday's [summit](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-deadline-arrives-putin-agree-ceasefire-face-sanctions/story?id=124479057)
 between President [Donald Trump](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump)
 and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska will be an important test in ending the war in Ukraine.

"Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end," Rutte told ABC News' "This Week" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.

"When it comes to full-scale negotiations, and let’s hope that Friday will be an important step in that process. And for NATO, to have no limitations on our presence on the eastern flank," Rutte added.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte appears on "This Week" on Aug. 10, 2025.

ABC News

The NATO chief also acknowledged the reality that Russia is in control of some of Ukraine's prewar territory.

"The question will be how to go forward past a ceasefire, including what it means in terms of security guarantees for Ukraine," he said.

He continued, "When it comes to this whole issue of territory, when it comes to acknowledging, for example, maybe in a future deal that Russia is controlling de facto, factually some of the territory of Ukraine, it has to be effectual recognition, and not a political de jure recognition."

In recent days, Trump has suggested “some swapping of territories” as part of a potential peace deal. Several European nations similarly say there should be no peace talks without Ukraine present.

While Rutte sung the president's praises regarding this upcoming meeting, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who also appeared on "This Week," was critical of Trump's approach to dealing with Putin.

_Here are more highlights from Rutte's interview:_

### On whether there are risks of rewarding Russia with summit

**Karl:** My next guest, Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, says that this meeting comes in a very dangerous point for Ukraine, and he fears that negotiations are sliding in Russia's direction. Is there a risk that something is agreed to here that rewards Russia for its invasion of Ukraine?

**Rutte:** No, I don't think the risk is there. So it's not inevitable, but I think this is a very risky meeting upcoming from the perspective not just of Ukraine, but the Western alliance.

### On Trump's strategy on Ukraine

**Bolton:** You know, ultimately, I don't think you negotiate under the circumstances that are being presented to them. And I think we've gone through 3 1/2 years here where neither the United States nor NATO have had an effective strategy for Ukraine to win. And I think the danger with Trump's present position is, notwithstanding allowing the Patriots to be deployed to Ukraine, he has not made any kind of commitment on continued military assistance, weapons, ammunition and most critically, intelligence.

### On Trump's international record

**Bolton:** I don't think what he has done materially changes the situations in any of those circumstances or several others he's mentioned like Pakistan-India, where the Indians -- not just the government, the entire country -- were outraged that he tried to take credit for that."

WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Monday NATO membership for Ukraine was not under discussion but that there was a discussion on "Article 5" type security guarantees for the country that [Russia invaded in February 2022](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

"But what we are discussing here is not NATO membership, what we are discussing here is Article 5 type of security guarantees for Ukraine and what exactly they will entail will now be more specifically discussed."

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
------------------

[Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty](/world/what-did-trump-say-about-nato-funding-what-is-article-5-2024-02-12/)
 enshrines the principle of collective defense, in which an attack on any of its 32 members is considered an attack on all. President Donald Trump [met](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-war-live-trump-zelenskiy-discuss-russias-terms-peace-2025-08-18/)
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and NATO and European leaders at the White House on Monday.

Rutte told Fox News security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed in the meeting and that there was no discussion about boots on the ground.

Trump described Monday's meetings as "very good" and said he called Putin to begin arrangements for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents before a trilateral meeting that would also include Trump.

I will be very brief. I really want to thank you, President of the United States, dear Donald, for the fact that you, as I said before, broke the deadlock, basically, with President Putin by starting that dialog; and I think it was in February that you had the first phone call. We have to stop the destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure. It is a terrible war, so I’m really excited, and let’s make the best out of today and make sure that from today onwards, we get this thing to an end as soon as possible.

I really want to thank you for your leadership, what you are doing, Volodymyr, but of course, also all the European colleagues, it is really crucial. And the fact that you (referring to President Trump) have said “I’m willing to participate in the security guarantees” is a big step. And from there, we are now where we are today. And that is, I think, if we play this well, we could end this. And we have to end this."

On the eve of his killing, Ukraine's SBU declared that he had been named in absentia in a criminal case for the "mass use" of prohibited chemical weapons on the eastern and southern fronts in Ukraine.

It cited "more than 4,800 cases of the enemy using chemical munitions" on Ukrainian territory since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in February 2022.

It said toxic substances had been used in drone attacks as well as in combat grenades.

Kirillov earned his notoriety from the start of the war with a series of claims directed towards both Ukraine and the West, none of which was based on fact.

Among his most outrageous claims was one that [the US had been building biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60711705)
. It was used in an attempt to justify the full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in 2022.

He produced documents in March 2022 which he claimed had been seized by Russia on the day of the invasion on 24 February - which were amplified by pro-Kremlin media but rubbished by independent experts.

Kirillov's notorious allegations against Ukraine continued into this year.

Last month he claimed that "one of the priority aims" of Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russia's Kursk border region was to seize the Kursk nuclear power plant.

He presented a slideshow, purportedly based on a Ukrainian report, alleging that in the event of an accident only Russia territory would be exposed to radioactive contamination.

One of Kirillov's repeated themes was that Ukraine was seeking to develop a "dirty bomb".

Two years ago he alleged that "two organisations in Ukraine have specific instructions to create a so-called 'dirty bomb'.

Igor Kirillov: Russia's chemical weapons chief and mouthpiece killed in Moscow

As head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops, Igor Kirillov - who has died in an explosion in Moscow - was accused by the West of overseeing the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.

In Russia, he was viewed as a tireless patriot, fighting for the truth and exposing Western "crimes".

Sources from Ukraine's SBU security service said it it was behind the blast and referred to a special operation against a "war criminal" and a legitimate target.

Kirillov and an aide were killed by explosives planted in an electric scooter, according to Russian officials, which was blown up as he left the building he lived in on Ryazansky Prospekt in south-eastern Moscow.

He had become notorious for outlandish briefings at the Russian defence ministry which prompted the UK Foreign Office to label him as a ["significant mouthpiece for Kremlin disinformation"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yj5qepe4wo)
.

Kirillov was far more than just a mouthpiece, heading Russia's Timoshenko Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Academy, before going on to lead the Russian army's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops in 2017.

The force's main tasks involve identifying hazards and protecting units from contamination but also "causing loss to the enemy by using flame-incendiary means", the Russian defence ministry says. That is thought to refer to Russia's flame-thrower system that can destroy targets with the use of thermobaric warheads.

[The UK Foreign Office said](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-sanctions-russian-troops-deploying-chemical-weapons-on-the-battlefield)
 that the force Kirillov commanded had deployed "barbaric chemical weapons in Ukraine", highlighting what it said was the widespread use of riot control agents and "multiple reports of the use of the toxic choking agent chloropicrin".

! This work is in its final stage".

His claims were rejected by Western countries as "transparently false".

But Kirillov's claims prompted Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to warn that if Russia suggested Kyiv was preparing that kind of weapon, it meant only one thing - that Russia was already preparing it.

Igor Kirillov (R) was put in charge of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection troops seven years ago

Kirillov returned to his dirty bomb claims last summer, this time alleging the discovery of a chemical weapons laboratory close to Avdiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine that the Russians captured last February.

Kyiv, he claimed, was violating the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) with a variety of substances with the assistance of Western countries, including the psychochemical warfare agent BZ as well as hydrocyanic acid and cyanogen chloride.

Russia is a signatory to the CWC and was adjudged to have destroyed all its Cold War-era chemical weapons in 2017. The following year Russian agents carried out a deadly attack on the British city of Salisbury using the nerve agent Novichok.

The US has since accused Russia of using the choking agent chloropicrin on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Kirillov's violent death has come as a shock to Russia's military and political establishment."

Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers in a serious violation of international law, the Dutch and German intelligence agencies have said.

On Friday, they said there was extensive evidence that Moscow’s forces were using banned products, including the choking agent chloropicrin.

Russia denies using the prohibited weapons, as does Ukraine. This means looking at more sanctions and specifically not allowing them (Russia) to participate in international bodies like the Executive Council of the OPCW (the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons),” Brekelmans said.

The OPCW said last year that Russian and Ukrainian accusations that the other side was using banned weapons were “insufficiently substantiated”.

The disarmament agency, which is based in The Hague and has 193 member states, has not conducted a full investigation, something which can only happen at the request of member states.

Fighting grinds on
------------------

The allegations of increased Russian chemical weapons use came as Ukraine reported the largest ever [Russian drone and missile attack](/news/2025/7/4/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-1226)
 on the country.

A Ukrainian air force official told local media it is the biggest of the war so far, with Moscow firing 539 drones and 11 missiles overnight.

The attacks on Kyiv injured at least 23 people, damaging railway infrastructure and setting buildings and cars on fire, authorities said.

A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Rostov region killed at least one woman and forced the evacuation of dozens of people from their homes, the acting governor said.

In the meantime, on Friday, both countries confirmed that they had carried out their latest prisoner exchange, with neither side giving details about the number of soldiers involved.

The swap followed an agreement made in the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in June.

On the diplomatic front, United States President Donald Trump said he had made no progress, expressing his “disappointment”, during his phone call on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, who reportedly [reiterated](/news/2025/7/3/russia-will-not-back-down-on-ukraine-war-goals-putin-tells-trump)
 he would stop his invasion only if the conflict’s “root causes” were tackled.

Trump also said he was planning to discuss the conflict with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. Chloropicrin is dropped by drones to drive soldiers out of trenches, and then kill them,” Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said in a post on X, referring to Russia’s purported use.

Brekelmans, who is now calling for tougher sanctions against Russia, described the use of chemical weapons as “horrible and unacceptable”.

Peter Reesink, the head of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD), confirmed that the findings were based on its own investigations. There were “thousands of instances” of chemical weapons use by Russia, he said.

“This isn’t just some ad hoc tinkering at the front line; it is truly part of a large-scale programme. And that is, of course, also concerning because if we don’t clarify and publicise what Russia is doing, it’s highly likely these trends will continue,” Reesink added.

Germany’s BND foreign intelligence agency also corroborated the MIVD’s conclusions.

The Russian army was using tear gas as well as “the more dangerous chemical chloropicrin, which can be lethal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces” in Ukraine, the BND said in a statement.

“This represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances,” it noted.

Speaking to Reuters about the Dutch and German intelligence reports, Brekelmans, the Dutch defence minister, said that at least three Ukrainian deaths had been linked to Russian chemical weapons, with more than 2,500 people reporting symptoms related to the banned products.

More needed to be done to deter Russia from deploying such weapons, he suggested.

“We must further increase the pressure. Zelenskyy said he hoped to speak with Trump about the supply of US [weapons to Ukraine](/news/2025/7/2/us-halts-some-weapons-shipments-to-ukraine)
.

The US said on Tuesday that it was halting some weapons deliveries to Kyiv that were promised under the Biden administration, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Ukraine.

The Biden administration-era pledges, which included various munitions to bolster Ukraine’s defences, are now under review as the Pentagon reassesses current inventory levels."

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")

In late 2024, the United States also provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan, funded by interest generated from frozen Russian assets.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

The $128 billion figure counts committed aid, much of which has yet to be delivered, according to an [analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraine-now-doomed "analysis")

Why has the United States provided aid to Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------

Much of the U.S. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s defense and counteroffensive against Russia.

What weapons and equipment has the United States sent Ukraine?

NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the [risk of a nuclear war](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war "risk of a nuclear war")
. In addition, after widely broadcast friction between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a February 28 Oval Office visit, European nations such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all stepped up pledges of support. 

For nearly three years of war, the United States has provided or agreed to provide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities."

While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the claim that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. One source mentions approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). Another source mentions the Trump administration's announcement of weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The evidence also mentions that the Biden administration is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The claim's specific amount of $350 billion is not supported by the evidence.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) mentions that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022, and that President Trump announced a new arrangement to send weapons to Ukraine last month. <image:496>, <image:497>

The CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine. <image:503>, <image:502>, <image:501> Another article published on July 25, 2025, mentions the administration's announcement of military aid for Ukraine. The Trump administration announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the claim that the U.S. had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. One source mentions approximately $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022 ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)). Another source mentions the Trump administration's announcement of weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The evidence also mentions that the Biden administration is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The claim's specific amount of $350 billion is not supported by the evidence.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


# Your Judgement

The evidence does not support the claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. The provided sources mention different amounts, none of which match the claimed figure.

The claim is false. While the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine, the evidence, including sources like NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)), indicates a much lower figure than $350 billion.

 As uncertainty in U.S.–Ukraine relations grows, informal ties with some U.S. Buffett, a Republican and son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. He’s making his 18th visit to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We’re on track,” Buffett told The Associated Press, adding that his foundation will surpass $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. So, we’ll stick with it as long as we need to.”

The AP caught up with Buffett aboard a train with Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko on Saturday. Svyrydenko calls him “one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.”

Buffett is [among a number of Americans](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-be08b99bf75e99de991557ac18c7bf15)
 across the U.S. hasn’t done enough to help Ukraine defeat Russia over the past few years.

On this trip, Buffett and Svyrydenko traveled to the country’s northern Sumy region, where the situation has significantly worsened following Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in Russia’s Kursk region.

They visited the villages of Popivka and Bobryk, which — like much of the region — lie in a high-risk zone for land mines. They also stopped at a local school that had been relocated to a basement, where children now study during hours-long air raid alerts.

Buffett’s foundation, which focuses on humanitarian needs like agriculture, infrastructure and mine clearance, has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, including $175 million in humanitarian demining."

**US philanthropist Howard Buffett has kept up funding Ukraine with informal arrangements, even amidst deteriorating relations between the two nations since President Donald Trump’s election into office.** 

The son of billionaire Warren Buffett and longtime Republican Party supporter made his 18th visit to Ukraine in three years via a train trip in April, underscoring his funding support. 

Buffett told the Associated Press that Trump’s apparent closeness with Russia and clampdown on military support for Ukraine has not altered his foundation’s support in Ukraine. 

‘It doesn’t change anything we do. Howard Buffett maintains Ukraine philanthropy despite deteriorating US support 
===============================================================================

! We’re on track,’ he said. 

Howard Buffett’s foundation aims to surpass the $1 billion giving mark this year for Ukraine. 

So far, the Buffett Foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding towards clearing mines and boosting agriculture and local infrastructure.  

Ukraine’s agricultural sector has lost 20.5 per cent of farmland since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  

And some 139,000 square kilometres of land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined. A similar trip is expected in May. 

In a video posted by the Associated Press, Buffett was joined by Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The pair have established close relations, with Svyrydenko describing Buffett as ‘one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.’ 

Buffett also scorned the possibility of a peace deal, calling it ‘impossible’ given Trump’s pivoting towards the Kremlin and Putin’s reluctance. 

“At the end of the day, I think the US will do the right thing, but it may be a painful process and there may be a lot more Ukrainians that die,” he said.

Your email address will not be published. Two-thirds of that is fertile farmland belonging to Ukrainian farmers who have sowed wheat for generations. 

The foundation also funded bipartisan trips for US lawmakers to visit Ukraine in 2023."

Howard G. The fighting persists despite initial ceasefire attempts, and it remains uncertain whether the US will continue its support for Ukraine in repelling Russia’s invasion.

Speaking to AP, Buffett confirmed his foundation’s ongoing commitment to Ukraine, saying that the political situation in the US will not affect their support.

> _“It doesn’t change anything we do. Buffett’s commitment includes addressing critical needs such as agriculture, infrastructure, and humanitarian demining, with a focus on areas heavily affected by landmines.

Buffett traveled with Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko to visit Sumy Oblast, which has seen a worsening situation following the Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in the adjacent Russian Kursk Oblast. 

Buffett’s foundation has already contributed around $800 million to Ukraine since the invasion began, with $175 million dedicated to humanitarian demining efforts. Since the war’s start, mine-related incidents have [killed](https://apnews.com/article/cyprus-ukraine-landmines-explosive-ordnance-demining-munitions-45aaa2eb9ac4d1dd9e94d3a8b666d1d1)
 335 people and injured 823.

Despite challenges in US–Ukraine relations, Buffett remains confident that many US lawmakers continue to support Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty. He believes the US will “_do the right thing_,” although he acknowledges the painful process ahead.

(Kyiv, October 30, 2024) – [Ukraine’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine)
 new [law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3894-IX)
 banning religious organizations with ties to the [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia)
 Orthodox Church is overly broad and could have far-reaching consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedom, Human Rights Watch said today. He noted that there are Ukrainian Orthodox Church congregations in occupied territories that “refuse to join the Russian Orthodox Churchfor many reasons.” He said that the ban would sever the connection with those churches, and that the “Russian Orthodox Church will put their own people in place and that will be the end of it.”

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented multiple incidents in which groups of people forcefully entered churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Сhurch, “[justifying their actions](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2024/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-dec-2023-29-feb-2024.pdf)
 with decisions from local authorities to register new religious communities of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine at the same address as existing Ukrainian Orthodox Churchcommunities.” In September, Ukraine [blocked](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/rozporyadzhennya-ncu-vid-12-09-2024-769-2574-pro-blokuvannya-domennikh-imen)
 the website of the outlet DialogTUT, which covered Ukrainian Orthodox Church activities.

Ukraine is obligated under Ukrainian and international law to guarantee religious freedom. The law does not impact the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities should address any security concerns related to the activities of religious bodies or personnel that threaten state security, whether by individuals or specific religious communities, rather than effectively banning entire religious communities based solely on presumed affiliations with the Russian Orthodox Church, Human Rights Watch said. 

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s security service has initiated criminal proceedings [against](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/get-vid-moskvi-k-radi-zbirayutsya-zaboroniti-1723413259.html)
 at least 100 clergymen, most affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on charges of “collaborationism,” treason, and“aiding the aggressor state.” 

Broad implementation of the new law risks severe practical consequences for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s congregations and millions of parishioners, Human Rights Watch said. It said it would develop regulations to implement the law within three months of its publication, to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 

The law considers any ties, not just institutional and organizational, but also canonical, with the Russian Orthodox Church to be grounds for banning it. 

Requiring the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to sever canonical ties may cast doubt on the legitimacy of its adherents’ religious beliefs, which the European Court of Human Rights has identified as a key element of the right to freedom of religion, Human Rights Watch said. “But the law interferes with the right to freedom of religion and is so broad that it could violate the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox Church members.”

The Ukrainian government should suspend implementation of the law and request the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe’s’ Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to provide expert analysis of the law that would be the basis for its rights-respecting revision, Human Rights Watch said.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was [established](https://risu.ua/ukrajinska-pravoslavna-cerkva-moskovskogo-patriarhatu_n48337)
 in 1990 as an autonomous branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leadership supports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet, in January 2023, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience found these steps insufficient, stating that the “status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a structural subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church... remains unchanged.”

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church exists alongside the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was [established](https://www.pomisna.info/uk/document-post/patriarshyj-i-synodalnyj-tomos-nadannya-avtokefalnogo-tserkovnogo-ustroyu-pravoslavnij-tserkvi-v-ukrayini/)
 in 2019 under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. They range from restrictions on ownership and operation of religious properties to difficulties in accessing places of worship and heightened risk of security service surveillance and prosecution.

Any prosecution or penalty not based on specific, unlawful actions but solely on the adherence to a peaceful practice of faith, constitutes religious discrimination and is prohibited by international human rights law. 

In a written response to questions Human Rights Watch sent on October 2, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience said that the law’s main objective is “to prevent the network of religious organizations officially registered in Ukraine from being used against Ukraine.” 

The agency said that Ukraine “does not demand that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church betray the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, change liturgical practices or language, switch to a different liturgical calendar, or join another church jurisdiction. The only requirement that the Law insists on is withdrawing from the Russian Orthodox Church, which is involved in the war against Ukraine.”

The agency also shared recommendations on measures that could be taken to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church."

Ukraine’s Ban on Moscow-Linked Church Will Have Far-Reaching Consequences
=========================================================================

The repercussions of outlawing the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate could be more serious than Kyiv seems to realize.

Published on September 4, 2024

Ukraine has passed a law banning religious organizations with links to Russia. The formal ban is a major moment in a long-running dispute, and will have far-reaching consequences for Ukraine both at home and abroad.

When the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was established in 2018 under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, it was hoped that the UOCMP and the OCU would gradually merge. In any foreign country where there are Ukrainians, there should be our Ukrainian church.” She seems unaware that under canon law, the OCU cannot [open](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/01/can-the-ukrainian-orthodox-church-survive-the-war-with-russia?lang=en)
 parishes outside Ukraine.

Voting on the new law in Ukraine’s parliament revealed some committed opposition to the ban. It has also been criticized by the [Pope](https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-condemns-ukraine-s-ban-russian-orthodox-church)
 and the [World Council of Churches](https://www.oikoumene.org/news/wcc-urges-caution-with-new-law-passed-by-ukrainian-rada)
.  

One of the reasons Kyiv took so long to outlaw the UOCMP was for fear of a hostile reaction from conservatives in the United States. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, for example, [said](https://t.me/vereshchuk_iryna/2430)
 on August 20 that Ukraine should “stop the influence of the harmful Russian church on Ukrainians not only in Ukraine, but also outside its borders. The main target of the law is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOCMP), which was established in 1990 as a self-governing church under the canonical jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).

The Ukrainian government held back from taking such a step immediately after the full-scale invasion by Russia: after all, the UOCMP is the country’s biggest church. Instead, the continued presence of a religious organization formally affiliated with Moscow has angered patriotic Ukrainians and provoked the suspicion of the authorities.

UOCMP [efforts](https://news.church.ua/2022/05/27/postanova-soboru-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi-vid-27-travnya-2022-roku/#2024-08-22)
 in recent years to show it is independent of Moscow have not convinced officials. As of May 2024, it had [10,587 parishes](https://data.gov.ua/dataset/3d0dc6d8-bc68-4796-a08c-70222258e566)
 in Ukraine compared to the OCU’s 8,075. Between February 2022 and May 2024, just [685 UOCMP parishes](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/skolko-cerkvey-upc-mp-deystvuet-v-ukraine-v-2024-godu-i-skolko-pereshlo-v-pcu-dannye-opendatabot-50415369.html)
 went over to the OCU—and they were mostly in the center and west of the country. The boxer Oleksandr Usyk, for example—one of Ukraine’s most popular sportspeople—is a vocal public [supporter](https://xsport.ua/ru/boxing_s/news/-usik-soobshchil-chto-prodolzhaet-khodit-v-upts-mp_8969480/)
 of the UOCMP.

The international context of the ban is also significant."

[Joe Rogan](https://globalnews.ca/tag/joe-rogan/)
 said he will not be attending an upcoming [UFC](https://globalnews.ca/tag/ufc/)
 fight in Montreal because he doesn’t “go to Canada anymore” and joked that he would “rather go to Russia.”

! He’s a sketchy guy,” Rogan said on the podcast.

Rogan also said Trudeau has “some shaky deals” and added that he would “like to see where the money is coming from.” It is still unclear what deals Rogan was referring to.

If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. “I rather go to Russia.”

Story continues below advertisement

Rogan claimed that Canadian authorities froze bank accounts of people who “only donated to the truckers” and that people are “still in jail” for their participation.

“It was kind of when a lot of people woke up,” Rogan added.

This isn’t the first time Rogan has criticized Canada on the podcast.

In March, Rogan [said he didn’t love Trump’s idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4m1MOSI5n8)
 of making Canada the 51st U.S. What comes next?](https://globalnews.ca/news/11320440/air-canada-flight-attendants-vote-strike-timeline/)

Back in July 2022, Rogan [had some strong words about Canada and Trudeau](https://globalnews.ca/news/8997721/joe-rogan-canada-communist-justin-trudeau-sketchy-dictator/)
, voicing his distaste for the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Canada’s communist,” Rogan said on the podcast. <image:2033>

The UFC commentator shared his thoughts on [his podcast, _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xr-DqSmJEXI?si=Q3f-0swafwYpFl0G)
, when asked if he will be in attendance to watch UFC fighter Belal Muhammad defend his Welterweight gold against Jack Della Maddalena in May.

When Rogan asked his guests Gordon Ryan, Brendan Schaub and Eddie Bravo when the fight is set to take place, they said, “About two months.”

“Where’s that at?” Rogan asked.

_The Joe Rogan Experience_ producer Jamie Vernon told Rogan that the fight will be held in Montreal at UFC 315 on May 10.

“Wow, I won’t be there."

Content: "I’d rather go to Russia,” he said, laughing.

Earlier in the show, Rogan remarked that Canada’s government is “terrible” — but said “the Canadian people are awesome.” 

Rogan said in July that his beef with Canada initially began during the COVID-19 pandemic after thousands of protesting truckers [descended on the capital in Ottawa](https://nypost.com/2022/02/14/canadas-trudeau-invokes-emergency-powers-to-quell-protests/)
 and railed against the country’s vaccine mandate, [according to Front Office Sports](https://frontofficesports.com/joe-rogan-canada-massive-ufc-315-event/)
.

President Trump, who Rogan helped throttle to a second term in the White House with an appearance on his podcast days before the 2024 election, has sparked tensions between the US and Canada for [imposing new tariffs](https://nypost.com/2025/03/23/world-news/canadian-pm-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-slams-trump-trade-war/)
 — and suggesting Canada become the 51st state.

The trade war has previously seeped into the sports world, with Canadian fans booing the US national anthem during the NHL-run 4 Nations Face-Off tournament.

Rogan [admitted last month](https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/joe-rogan-doesnt-want-canada-to-be-us-51st-state/)
 that he does not think Canada should join the union, but wants the two countries to make up and end what he called “the dumbest f–king feud.”

Rogan gave the brush off on his podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” when asked about UFC 315 in May being in Montreal.

“Wow. I don’t go to Canada anymore,” he said, having previously spoken out against the Great White North’s spat with President Trump.

 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.
>

The president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, **Stephen Capus**, has [said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-prisoner-swap-belarus-gershkovich-whelan-alsu/33059280.html)
 that the broadcaster welcomed news of RFE/RL journalist **Alsu Kurmasheva**’s “imminent release and are grateful to the American government and all who worked tirelessly to end her unjust treatment by Russia.”

“Everybody needs to start carrying guns,” Jones added.

There is no evidence that Jamie White was on any “list of enemies of Ukraine” – and it is doubtful that such a list even exists.

The articles from [Fox 7 Austin](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/infowars-writer-shooting-austin-police-jamie-white), [CBS Austin](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/teen-charged-with-capital-murder-in-shooting-death-of-infowars-reporter-in-austin), and [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-release-more-details-murder-infowars-reporter-jamie-white-search-suspects-continues) detail that White was shot during a vehicle burglary.

None of the sources mention White being on a Ukrainian hit list.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars writer, was shot in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine, while White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing. The Latin Times reports that White was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, with gunshot wounds, and the police believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle. Alex Jones claimed that White was on a Ukrainian hit list, and White's social media accounts indicate that he believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" discusses the murder of Jamie White in Austin, Texas, and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. <image:782>, <image:785>, <image:791>, <image:792>

### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars writer, was shot in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine, while White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing. The Latin Times reports that White was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, with gunshot wounds, and the police believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle. Alex Jones claimed that White was on a Ukrainian hit list, and White's social media accounts indicate that he believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" discusses the murder of Jamie White in Austin, Texas, and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. <image:782>, <image:785>, <image:791>, <image:792>

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that Jamie White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 10, 2025. However, the evidence also indicates that Alex Jones and the "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" have speculated that White was on a Ukrainian hit list. The evidence does not definitively confirm that White was on a Ukrainian hit list.

The claim that Jamie White was on a Ukrainian hit list is not supported by the evidence. While White was shot dead in Austin, Texas, on March 9, 2025, the official investigation, as reported by [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/infowars-reporter-shot-dead-apartment-after-possibly-interrupting/story?id=119677965), does not mention any connection to a Ukrainian hit list. Although some sources, like Alex Jones, speculated about this, there is no definitive evidence to confirm it.

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

The claim has been spread by a number of prominent right-leaning commentators and politicians, including [Madison Cawthorn](https://twitter.com/CawthornforNC)
, [James Woods](https://twitter.com/RealJamesWoods/status/1592041414829166592)
, [Calvin Robinson](https://twitter.com/calvinrobinson/status/1592031504875544577)
, [Seth Dillon](https://twitter.com/SethDillon/status/1591992688940924931)
 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)
, among others.

Various iterations of the narrative took root on conspiracy theory subreddits, 4Chan, and other fringe online spaces.

The collapse of FTX has had a staggering impact on the world of cryptocurrencies, resulting in a dominoes-like collapse of popular cryptos, such as [Bitcoin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bitcoin)
, the value of [which fell to a two-year-low](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/09/bitcoin-falls-below-17k-amid-latest-ftx-meltdown/)
, and shaking the industry as a whole.

To understand if and how its demise is connected to U.S. dollar, though that may be no longer [tenable](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/10/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-slips-from-1-peg/)
).

Everstake, a crypto firm involved in setting up the donations, [has responded on Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592621937054085120)
 to claims that these funds were illegally transferred to the Democrats, stating Aid for Ukraine had used FTX "only a few times in March 2022 exclusively to convert crypto donations into fiat" which it said The National Bank of Ukraine [had confirmed receipt of.](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)
, [10,723 Ethereum](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x165CD37b4C644C2921454429E7F9358d18A45e14)
, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

These include (but are not limited to) verification of cash assistance, using regulated money transfer agents, and using security-locked beneficiary lists before they are disseminated.

However, Ukraine’s government “never invested any funds into FTX,” Alex Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation in Ukraine said [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1592241279051743233%7Ctwgr%5Eff3dcafd17a806bb6a0a472b14ff2c933ac7e1a9%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fleadstories.com%2Fhoax-alert%2F2022%2F11%2Ffact-check-no-evidence-us-aid-to-ukraine-was-laundered-through-crypto-exchange-channeled-to-democrats.html)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

# Your Summary

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. The Daily Beast fact-checked the claim and found that Biden did not say no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. Instead, he stated he would ask Congress for a supplemental aid bill. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Biden announced a new $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine on September 26, 2024, not on September 29, 2024, as the claim suggests.

## Claim
Claim: "In remarks to reporters on September 29, 2024 US President Joe Biden announced that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurrican Helene, but 2.4 billion US-$ more for Ukraine."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Daily Beast, in an article published on Yahoo News, fact-checked the claim and stated that Biden did not say no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. The article mentions that Biden announced a new $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine on Sept. 26, 2024. The White House published a transcript of the exchange. The article also mentions that Biden said he would be asking Congress for a supplemental aid bill for those affected by the storm. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html))

An article from France 24, published on October 1, 2024, reports on President Biden's response to Hurricane Helene. Biden visited North Carolina to assess rescue efforts. The article mentions the death toll reached 130. Reuters published an article on September 30, 2024, stating that President Joe Biden spoke with the governors of Georgia and North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Biden said he would visit North Carolina later in the week and that the Biden-Harris administration would stay "until the job is done." The article mentions that Biden "may have to request" that Congress returns for a special session to pass a supplemental funding package to help those affected. ([https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118](https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20241001-biden-defends-government-response-as-hurricane-helene-death-toll-reaches-118)) and ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-spoke-with-governors-after-hurricane-helene-will-visit-affected-areas-2024-09-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-spoke-with-governors-after-hurricane-helene-will-visit-affected-areas-2024-09-30/)). <image:9599> <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The Daily Beast fact-checked the claim and found that Biden did not say no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. Instead, he stated he would ask Congress for a supplemental aid bill. Furthermore, the evidence indicates that Biden announced a new $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine on September 26, 2024, not on September 29, 2024, as the claim suggests.


# Your Judgement

The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Biden did not announce the cessation of aid for Hurricane Helene victims. Instead, he stated he would seek additional funding. The claim also misrepresents the timing and nature of aid to Ukraine. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. Fact-checkers found that Biden did not announce the end of aid for Hurricane Helene victims; instead, he planned to request additional funding, as reported by [The Daily Beast](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html). Additionally, the claim incorrectly states the date and nature of aid to Ukraine.

**A US National Football League (NFL) quarterback has refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at what he sees as racial injustice.**

Colin Kaepernick, who plays with the San Francisco 49ers, remained seated as the anthem was played.

"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour," he explained.

Some fans booed the player when he took to the field.

But his team said they supported his right to protest, which took place as the 49ers hosted the Green Bay Packers in a pre-season game on Friday.

"We recognise the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem," the team said.

An NFL spokesman said players were "encouraged but not required" to stand during the anthem.

This past Friday, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick, 28, [later said](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem)
. Common arguments online include: _How dare Kaepernick disrespect the very country that enabled him to become a rich athlete?_ (his current contract is reported to be worth $114 million), and, _He’s only making a political statement now because his career is on the decline_ (he’s struggled to bounce back after three surgeries).

This feverish level of ire is ironic when you consider that, in recent years, NFL players have committed a laundry list of criminal offenses that prompted less outcry. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” When “I feel like that flag represents what it’s supposed to represent and this country is representing people the way that it’s supposed to,” he continued, “I’ll stand.”

Though the likes of the NBA’s LeBron James and Dwyane Wade have voiced their support for #BlackLivesMatter, and WNBA team the Minnesota Lynx wore black practice jerseys after the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, Kaepernick is weathering a bigger backlash. (So be it, Kaepernick said: “If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.”) Fringe websites are alleging he has covertly converted to Islam, which, some people still don’t get, would say absolutely nothing about his patriotism. The only crime by an NFL player that the general population seemed as angry about as Kaepernick’s sitting during the national anthem was Michael Vick’s role in a dogfighting ring.

“Of all the offensive things professional football players do, taking a political stance seems to be one of the least objectionable,” Michael Ian Black sagely tweeted over the weekend.

So why does Kaepernick’s peaceful and perfectly legal protest strike more of a chord than, say, killing a man? Because many people believe patriotism is all or nothing: You either comply with the standard, traditional means of loving your country—standing for the national anthem with your hand firmly over your heart (an oversight Gabby Douglas was bullied for during the Olympics)—or you may as well be a Russian spy with ISIL ties. Those people have a right to burn Kaepernick jerseys and disagree with him, just like he has a right to peaceful protest. Though we may all agree on some things, even many things, ultimately my lens as the daughter of a Cuban immigrant may differ from Kaepernick’s as a mixed-race man (I don’t care how rich he is), and a blue-blooded daughter of the Mayflower does not know the particular struggle of an African-American boy raised in poverty in inner-city L.A.

The truth is that patriotism is not one-size-fits-all, and loving your country—like loving anyone or anything—is not complete, total, and unwavering. Why can’t Kaepernick care about his country, while also calling it out, and holding it to a higher standard?"

Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Colin Kaepernick's protest is 'dumb and disrespectful'
===========================================================================

This article is more than 8 years old

The US supreme court justice in an interview with Katie Couric said sitting out national anthem is a ‘terrible thing’ for the NFL quarterback to do but not illegal

NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protest is “dumb and disrespectful”, the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in an interview released on Monday.

In a [wide-ranging interview](https://www.yahoo.com/katiecouric/ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-trump-kaepernick-and-her-lifelong-love-of-the-law-132236633.html)
 with Yahoo News’s Katie Couric, Ginsburg said she thought that while Kaepernick’s protest was legal, it was “a terrible thing to do”.

“What do I think? Kaepernick he was protesting against racial injustice in America, especially against police brutality.

It caught national attention and later inspired a host of [other NFL players](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/12/colin-kaepernick-anthem-protest-monday-night-football)
 and [sports stars](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/06/megan-rapinoe-national-anthem-protest-usa-soccer)
 to follow suit.

But Kaepernick’s protest has also drawn criticism, with some calling it disrespectful towards military servicemen and women. She [later said](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jul/14/ruth-bader-ginsburg-regrets-donald-trump-remarks-faker)
 those remarks were ill-advised.

 Kaepernick was exercising his constitutional right to make a statement. [At a CNN town hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=279&v=VPqOotT_ta8)
 a few weeks later, he said he wanted both sides to listen to each other.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump [said Kaepernick](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest)
 “should find a country that works better for him”.

Ginsburg caused controversy earlier this year when [she said](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/12/ruth-bader-ginsburg-donald-trump)
 she could not imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as president. I think it’s dumb and disrespectful. I would point out how ridiculous it seems to me to do such an act.”

Ginsburg went to some lengths to say that the protest was legal but that she disagreed with Kaepernick and other athletes’ stance.

“If they want to be stupid, there’s no law that should be preventive. What I would do is strongly take issue with the point of view that they are expressing when they do that.”

In August, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Kaepernick began sitting or kneeling during the national anthem in the pre-game buildup. Kaepernick has reiterated that it is not targeted at members of the military.

Barack Obama has also weighed in on Kaepernick’s protest."

Content: "REUTERS [Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tab](https://www.reutersagency.com/en/licensereuterscontent/?utm_medium=rcom-article-media&utm_campaign=rcom-rcp-lead)

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

*   Russia's online disinformation campaign extended well beyond 2016 and focused heavily on the NFL kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to stoke racial tensions, according to a new Senate report. 
*   It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
    , and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
    , but the new report builds on the extent to which this occurred. 
*   The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy continued as late as March 2018, and the trolls zeroed in on Colin Kaepernick at one point.

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Vance**: That’s exactly what you’re doing …

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

 Prior to Zelenskyy's meeting with Trump, senator [Lindsey Graham](/wiki/Lindsey_Graham "Lindsey Graham")

President Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was “not a man that wanted to make peace,” while claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin does want to end the war.

The Russian president by contrast, Trump said, “is going to want to make it, he wants to make it, he wants to end it.”

The comments from Trump came after an earlier meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart [devolved into an angry exchange](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/trump-zelensky-vance-oval-office/index.html)
 over the nature of US support and whether Zelensky had shown enough gratitude.

Asked whether he was considering cutting off military aid to Ukraine, Trump responded: “It doesn’t matter what I’m considering. He also said he was “grateful for the unwavering bicameral and bipartisan support.”

The US Agency for International Development’s $25 million contribution to an initiative to support Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure against Russian attacks was terminated this week, according to a source familiar.

NBC News was [first to report](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/state-department-terminates-us-support-ukraine-energy-grid-restoration-rcna194259)
.

**Some context:** The termination was among thousands foreign assistance awards canceled this week and came ahead of President Donald Trump’s contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The money was for the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which supports the Ukrainian government’s effort to support and repair their energy infrastructure, which has faced relentless Russian attacks throughout the course of the war.

Although the cancellation occurred before the Friday meeting between Trump and Zelensky, it comes amid a radical shift in policy toward Ukraine that has left some longtime diplomats shocked.

“I’m literally sick to my stomach,” one diplomat told CNN Friday.

“I fear for the fallout,” they said, predicting that “no one in Ukraine will sleep well tonight.”

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his [approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5300669/us-russia-ukraine-saudi-arabia-summit)
, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

[!U.S. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people," he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, "Yes, of course."

### "The free world needs a new leader"

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers. 

"President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., [said in a statement](https://jeffries.house.gov/2025/02/28/leader-jeffries-statement-on-white-house-meeting-with-president-zelensky/)

### [Trump, Zelenskyy shouting match underscores change in U.S. foreign policy](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5310647/trump-week-ukraine-russia)

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has "all the respect for your country" and saying, "I said thanks," as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to [sign a deal](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312880/trump-zelenskyy-minerals-ukraine-russia)
 that would give the United States access to [Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309996/ukraine-rare-earth-minerals-metals-deal)
. We're trying to solve a problem."

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, "You will feel influence."

### Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, [writing on his Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 platform that he had "determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace."

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact "ready for peace," while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. 28, 2025

An earlier headline incorrectly said President Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "ungrateful." Trump said Zelenskyy was "not acting at all thankful."

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, "You're not acting at all thankful" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, "You're gambling with World War III."

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 Eventually, the [Ukrainian Defence Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Ukraine) "Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)")
 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)
[\[b\]](#cite_note-"memory1-15)

According to the [Armed Forces of Ukraine](/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine "Armed Forces of Ukraine")
, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" states that in July 2024, a British Army official said that it would cost Russia 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. The article also mentions that by the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war. The article also states that as of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While a British Army official estimated that 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties would be needed to control four regions of Ukraine, the provided sources do not confirm that Russia has lost 1.5 million troops. The Russia Matters article states that over 700,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. Additionally, Meduza estimated over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died by the end of 2024.

The evidence indicates that the number of casualties is high, but it does not support the specific figure of 1.5 million troops lost as of February 2025. The data from Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian service, provides estimates up to December 2024, which is not aligned with the claim's timeframe.

To verify the claim, more specific data on Russian troop losses in February 2025 would be needed.

Ukrainian lawmakers protest with placards before a vote replacing a law that attempted to curb the powers of anticorruption bodies, in Kyiv, on July 31, 2025 \[Andrii Nesterenko/AFP\]

Published On 2 Aug 20252 Aug 2025

Ukrainian authorities have detained several officials over a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, just days after lawmakers restored the independence of the country’s two main investigative bodies.

The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) said in a joint statement on Saturday that they made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems.

“The essence of the scheme was to conclude state contracts with supplier companies at deliberately inflated prices,” they said, adding that the suspects had received kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts.

NABU and SAPO said they had caught a sitting lawmaker, two local officials and an unspecified number of National Guard personnel taking bribes. The suspects were not identified in Saturday’s statement.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs also said it had suspended the suspected National Guard members.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came under criticism last month for [trying to take away](/news/2025/7/29/why-zelenskyy-tried-to-curb-autonomy-of-ukraines-anticorruption-agencies)
 the anticorruption agencies’ independence and place them under the control of his prosecutor-general.

The agencies regained their autonomy after Zelenskyy’s move sparked the first antigovernment demonstrations in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022.

Zelenskyy, who enjoys far-reaching wartime powers, initially said he needed to bring the agencies under his control because they were inefficient and under “Russian influence”.

But he then said he had heard people’s anger and [submitted a bill](/news/2025/7/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-introduces-new-draft-law-after-anticorruption-protests)
 restoring the agencies’ independence, which was [passed by lawmakers](/news/2025/7/31/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-restore-anti-corruption-agencies-after-protests)
 on Thursday.

“It is important that anticorruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine’s European allies praised the about-face, having voiced concerns about the original defanging of the agencies.

Top officials had told Zelenskyy that Ukraine was jeopardising its bid for European Union membership by curbing the powers of its antigraft authorities.

In a statement about Saturday’s arrests, Zelenskyy said he was “grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work”.

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies exposed a corruption scheme involving procurement of military equipment just two days after the parliament reinstated their independence following mass protests and pressure from Brussels.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SABO) discovered a “large-scale corruption scheme” that exploited budget funds allocated for defense forces, the agencies said [in a statement](https://t.me/nab_ukraine/3312)
 on Saturday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the scheme "absolutely immoral,” in a [Telegram post](https://t.me/s/V_Zelenskiy_official)
. None of them were named in the statement.

The corruption involved purchasing equipment [at knowingly inflated prices](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-says-it-uncovers-major-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme-2025-08-02/)
 for which the participants illegally received 30 percent of the contract amount, according to the agencies. A similar approach was used in FPV drone procurement, the agencies said.

The revelation by the [anti-corruption agencies](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/02/europe/ukraine-corruption-drone-scheme-latam-intl)
 comes after the Ukrainian leadership attempted to subject the oversight of the bodies to the politically appointed prosecutor general of Ukraine. Those involved "were exposed for taking bribes," he said.

The NABU and the SABO said [the scheme included](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250802-ukraine-anti-corruption-agencies-uncover-major-drone-procurement-graft-scheme)
 a serving member of parliament, regional officials, the head of a unit of the National Guard’s military unit and a director of a company supplying drones. Zelenskyy signed a bill into law on Thursday that [restored independence](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-protests-volodymyr-zelenskyy-kyiv-power-politics-corruption/)
 to the agencies.

“There can only be zero tolerance for corruption, clear teamwork to expose corruption, and ultimately a fair sentence," Zelenskyy [wrote](https://t.me/V_Zelenskiy_official/15416)
 on Telegram on Saturday. "It is important that anti-corruption institutions work independently, and [the law adopted on Thursday](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gq3xwr357o)
 guarantees them all the opportunities for a real fight against corruption,” he said.

He called for [full and fair accountability](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/08/02/ukraine-uncovers-drone-procurement-corruption-scheme/)
. 

“We are counting on fair verdicts,” Zelenskyy said in an [official statement](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/rosiya-zatyaguye-vijnu-otzhe-bude-otrimuvati-spravedlivi-vid-99281)
 late Saturday. He said only combat officers will hold leadership positions in all logistics units of the National Guard. 

Zelenskyy reinstated the independence of the NABU and the SAPO after domestic protests and a [warning](https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelenskyy-europe-ukraine-anti-corruption-watchdog-independence/)
 from European Commission that Ukraine's EU bid was put at risk."

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered): 
Content: Al Jazeera published on August 2, 2025, that Ukrainian authorities detained several officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" in the defense sector involving the procurement of military drones and signal jamming systems. <image:k> The National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) made four arrests in connection with the scheme, which involved kickbacks of up to 30 percent of the contract amounts. The announcement came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy faced criticism for attempting to curb the independence of anti-corruption agencies.


From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html): 
Content: PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited huge stockpiles of arms after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine's legal arms industry has boomed, and the international small arms black market may have proved far more lucrative. A Ukrainian parliamentary inquiry concluded that between 1992 and 1998, Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets, in part through theft, discount arms sales and lack of oversight. Theft and corruption in the military facilitated the flow of illegal weapons from Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Shortfalls in required monitoring by American officials mean the U.S. cannot track more than $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to [Ukraine to fight invading Russian forces](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-lithuania-estonia-latvia-22ee93052cc1a6f21ea5ab586f42a3de)
, according to a Pentagon audit released Thursday.

The findings mean that 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear that the U.S. has provided Ukraine and was directed to guard against misuse or theft remained “delinquent,” the report by the Defense Department’s office of the inspector-general, the watchdog body for the Pentagon, said.

While Biden administration officials stressed Thursday that there was no evidence the weapons had been stolen, the audit undermines two years of lavish assurances from the administration that rigorous monitoring would keep U.S. The audit findings are likely to make Biden’s task even harder.

House Republican opposition for months has stalled Biden’s request to Congress [for $105 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-ukraine-israel-budget-3762a0bdf00653e3c8a38175d3c3d3cb)
 for Ukraine, Israel and other national security objectives. The end-use monitoring was required for gear that had sensitive technology and was smaller, making it more vulnerable to arms trafficking.

The Pentagon inspector general’s report said that the Defense Department had failed to maintain an accurate serial-number inventory of those defense articles for Ukraine as required.

Reasons for the shortfall in monitoring included limited staffing; the fact that procedures for carrying out end-use monitoring in a war zone weren’t put in place until December 2022; restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine; and a lack of internal controls on inventory, the report said.

While the U.S. had improved monitoring since the first year of the war, “significant personnel limitations and accountability challenges remain,” auditors said; full accounting of the gear was impossible as long as those shortfalls remained, they said.

Kirby said administration officials “has for many months now been interested in improving accountability over the end use of material that is provided to Ukraine.”

The audit didn’t attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. It noted the Defense Department inspector-general’s office now had people stationed in Ukraine, and that its criminal investigators were still looking into allegations of criminal misuse of the security assistance.

Defense Department officials told auditors they expected to have systems for improved oversight in place this year and next.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Associated Press published an article stating that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine. The Pentagon's inspector general found that 59% of the $1.7 billion in defense gear provided to Ukraine remained "delinquent". The article mentions that the reasons for the shortfall in monitoring include limited staffing, restrictions on movement for monitors within Ukraine, and a lack of internal controls on inventory. The audit did not attempt to determine whether any of the assistance had been diverted. <image:k>

From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: "Storch announced today that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released the “Audit of the DoD’s Execution of Funds to Assist Ukraine.” This audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies.

“Robust internal controls are the backbone for efficiency and accountability,” said IG Storch. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Inspector General Robert P. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose."

Verification within Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program

A video report, supposedly from The Wall Street Journal, is being [circulated](https://t.me/sheyhtamir1974/94005)
 online claiming that the U.S. Department of Defense is demanding that Kyiv conduct a full audit of all American weapons supplied to Ukraine. This demand is alleged to be due to the anticipated reduction or even complete cessation of arms supplies to Ukraine following Donald Trump’s potential victory in the presidential elections.

**However, this is a fake. Department of Defense’s [website](https://www.defense.gov/News/?Page=5)
 does not mention any requirement for Ukraine to conduct such an audit.

Furthermore, all quotes attributed to The Wall Street Journal’s national security and intelligence correspondent, [Warren Strobel](https://www.wsj.com/news/author/warren-p-strobel)
, are fabricated — he has not written about any audit in his articles or on [social media](https://twitter.com/wstrobel)
. On June 18, 2024, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a [report](https://globalinitiative.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Smoke-on-the-horizon-trends-in-arms-trafficking-from-the-conflict-in-Ukraine-GI-TOC-June-2024.v3.pdf)
 on arms market trends in the context of Russian aggression. It stated that while any war carries the risk of increased international arms trade, Ukraine has demonstrated the ability to prevent these risks and has implemented strict arms control and accounting measures. The report notes that arms control is one of the state’s priorities.

The narrative that military aid to Ukraine ends up in the hands of terrorists and criminal groups is primarily aimed at a Western audience. Additionally, there is no [information](https://archive.ph/zkuGs)
 online about a supposed 20-day Pentagon deadline for a weapons audit. WSJ colleagues would not have made such an error.

Warren Strobel has also not written about the risk of weapons supplied to Ukraine ending up on the black market."

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. military equipment sales to foreign governments in 2024 surged 29% to a record $318.7 billion, the State Department said on Friday, as countries sought to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine and prepare for major conflicts.

The figures from the Biden administration's final year underpin expectations of stronger sales for U.S. [Trump wants](/world/us/trump-says-not-sure-us-should-be-spending-anything-nato-2025-01-23/)
 other members of NATO to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense – a huge increase from the current 2% goal and a level that no NATO country, including the United States, currently reaches.

Defense contractors are straining to meet the surge of demand that has mushroomed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. is seeking to replenish stockpiles of weaponry and munitions sent to Kyiv.

Arms sales and transfers are viewed as "important U.S. weapons makers, which are expecting that orders for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, hundreds of Patriot missile interceptors, and a surge in orders for armored vehicles will underpin their results in coming quarters.

There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. arms trade and defense industry. Mike also spends a lot of his time writing on Ukraine and how industry has adapted, or faltered as it supports that conflict. Before his time in Washington Mike’s coverage focused on mergers and acquisitions for oil and gas companies, financial institutions, defense companies, consumer product makers, retailers, real estate giants, and telecommunications companies.

The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but **Russia** (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind **France** (9.6 per cent), while **Italy** (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. 

At least 35 states sent weapons to **Ukraine** after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period.

‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. 

‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. 

Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent).

**(Stockholm, 10 March 2025) Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published today by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), available at** [**www.sipri.org**](https://www.sipri.org/)

The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

The Trump administration has approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine, providing a potentially powerful tool to Kyiv as it continues to face a [relentless assault by Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack-hnk-intl)
.

The announcement of the proposed $825 million sale Thursday comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have yet to yield a result and following a deadly night of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital.

It was announced after President Donald Trump met this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin and separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Although the Trump administration has approved a number of sales of equipment to sustain existing weapons, this appears to be the first major arms sale of new weapons to Ukraine announced by the administration.

A source familiar said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles – which have a range of 150-280 miles – could be delivered later this year.

It is unclear whether there will be restrictions on their use.

“Ukraine will use funding from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway and Foreign Military Financing from the United States for this purchase,” the notice from the State Department said. “The ERAM is an example of working together with our NATO allies to develop a capable and scalable system capable of being delivered on a fast timeline.”

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a partner country that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,” it said.

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

Law enforcement teams search homes and offices in multiple cities at Kyiv’s request, but no arrests have been made so far.

Raids were conducted in several areas, including Sofia, in response to a request for legal assistance from Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating suspected overpricing in arms sales to Kyiv. Many deliveries are routed through intermediaries before reaching Ukrainian buyers, a process now under scrutiny in several countries.

Rashkov said the operation remained underway Tuesday afternoon and declined to speculate on possible arrests or charges.

The Supreme Prosecution Office of Cassation said it was overseeing the searches, which form part of an international effort to combat corruption and abuse in the arms trade. Bulgarian officials have not named the targets of the raids or confirmed whether any evidence has been found.

Ukrainian investigators allege certain intermediaries, including foreign-based arms dealers, profited from wartime defense contracts by inflating prices. It is unclear whether any seized materials will be shared directly with Ukrainian authorities.

Bulgaria is a producer and transit hub for weapons supplied to Ukraine, with exports surging since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

, which remain hidden underground and active, endanger aid workers, civilians, and other noncombatants.

The illicit nature of banned weapons and the potential for weaponry theft and circulation on the black market raise genuine concerns about the security of arms sales to Ukraine. Ukraine has historically had one of the largest [black markets](https://www.cato.org/blog/tragic-unsurprising-costs-loose-us-weapons-ukraine?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 for arms in Europe, with around 300,000 small arms and light weapons reported lost or stolen during the Russian invasion of Crimea between 2013 and 2015. This number is small compared to the estimated US$32 billion [lost](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 in Ukrainian military equipment stolen and sold on the black market between 1992 and 1998. Facts or False Alarms: The State of Illicit Arms in Ukraine
===========================================================

19.Jun.2024 . These two problems, which continue to plague lawmakers in Washington, have been exacerbated by the perpetuation of the war in Ukraine.

### The Illegal Movement of Weapons

_Weaponry Theft in Ukraine: Reality or Russian Disinformation?_

The invasion of Ukraine has [led](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 to a larger quantity of weapons entering Europe, and thus a greater possibility for weapons to go missing. Since 2022, there have been sporadic [reports](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/pentagon-watchdog-report-ukraine-weaponry/index.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 of small and large arms being stolen in Ukraine. Although it is difficult to confirm when and where weapons are stolen, the sheer scale of [weapon transfers](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/03/07/big-risk-of-weapons-vanishing-as-over-20-countries-send-arms-to-ukraine/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 means that it is highly likely that some weapons will go missing over the course of the conflict.

However, when examining the extent to which illicit weapons are being used or sold in Ukraine, it is important to acknowledge the massive amount of Russian [disinformation](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4403926-pentagon-watchdog-ukraine-military-aid/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 about these weapons. Reports about Finnish gangsters, French rioters, Nigerian fighters, and Mexican cartels gaining weapons—like rifles and grenade launchers—from Ukraine have all been [debunked](https://riskbulletins.globalinitiative.net/ukr-obs-001/01-monitoring-illicit-arms-flows-from-the-conflict-in-ukraine.html?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 as Russian propaganda attempting to sway the United States and NATO allies to decrease arms transfers. The current US end-use monitoring program [focuses](https://www.stimson.org/2022/a-us-plan-to-prevent-arms-diversion-in-ukraine-is-welcome-but-just-the-first-step/?ref=hir.harvard.edu)
 on Man-Portable Air Defense Systems and Anti-Tank/All-purpose Tactical Guided Missiles because of the classified information used to build those weapons. Contrarily, monitoring efforts have paid little attention to small arms and light weapons, yet those are the weapons more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations in Ukraine."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Harvard International Review (June 19, 2024) discusses the illicit arms trade in Ukraine, highlighting concerns about weapons theft and circulation on the black market. It mentions Ukraine's history of a large black market for arms, with an estimated $32 billion in military equipment lost between 1992 and 1998. The article notes reports of weapons being stolen since 2022, but also warns about Russian disinformation campaigns exaggerating the issue. The US end-use monitoring program focuses on specific weapon systems, with less attention on small arms and light weapons, which are more likely to be stolen by criminal organizations.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

The US-made M240 machine gun was offered for sale at US$8 000 and a Soviet-type AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher at US$6 000 – expensive, but a bargain for interested criminals, given the capabilities of such weapons.

Recent evidence shows early signs that organized arms trafficking is on the rise in Ukraine, marking a potential change from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s latest [report](https://globalinitiative.net/analysis/trends-arms-trafficking-conflict-ukraine-russia-monitor/)
 on the topic. Lviv is only about 70 kilometres from the Polish border and close to a number of regions in western Ukraine with long-established smuggling economies, such as Transcarpathia and Chernivtsi.  

Alarming as they may be, the seizures also demonstrate Ukraine’s efficacy in disrupting arms trafficking. The absence of a fully functioning law on weapons possession in the country could also lead to legal consequences for those willing to surrender and legitimize their small arms.

[! Published in June 2024 and covering arms trafficking in 2023, the report focused on the proliferation of Russian ‘trophy’ weapons collected from the battlefield, mainly small arms and grenades that were sold in an ad hoc and organic manner without centralized criminal control. 

But in June 2024, much heavier weapons were seized by Ukrainian law enforcement, including an anti-aircraft gun, a US machine gun and a high-end US automatic rifle carried exclusively by special forces. In Lviv in August 2024, law enforcement [broke up an arms trafficking ring](https://konkurent.ua/publication/142044/avtomati-pistoleti-granati-ta-pid-50-tisyach-naboivna-lvivschini-zatrimali-torgovtsiv-zbroeu-foto-video/)
 and seized 72 pistols, 20 assault rifles, 29 grenades and almost 49 000 rounds of ammunition. For many reasons, not least the maintenance of good relations with the West over materiel support, tackling arms trafficking remains a high priority for Ukrainian law enforcement.  

There have also been legislative developments."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources discuss corruption within Ukraine's defense sector. Al Jazeera reports that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a "large-scale corruption scheme" involving military drones and signal jamming systems, with kickbacks up to 30 percent of contract amounts (<image:k> - [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered]). Politico.eu also highlights a corruption scheme involving inflated prices for military equipment, with a 30 percent kickback, which President Zelenskyy called "absolutely immoral" - [https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/].

PBS.org discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime in Ukraine, noting that Ukraine lost $32 billion in military assets between 1992 and 1998 due to theft, discount arms sales, and lack of oversight - [https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html].


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported that the U.S. cannot track over $1 billion in weapons and military equipment provided to Ukraine, with 59% of $1.7 billion in defense gear remaining "delinquent" according to the Pentagon's inspector general. Reasons for the monitoring shortfall include limited staffing, movement restrictions, and a lack of internal inventory controls. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) also found insufficient documentation for $1.1 billion in funds, considering these as questioned costs. <image:k>

VoxUkraine fact-checked claims that the Pentagon is demanding an audit of weapons supplied to Ukraine, stating that the supply and end-use of weapons are already monitored by partners. The article also references a report stating that Ukraine has implemented strict arms control measures.

## Elaboration
The evidence reveals instances of corruption and a lack of complete oversight regarding the use of military aid provided to Ukraine. Reports from Al Jazeera and Politico.eu detail corruption schemes within Ukraine's defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks. The Associated Press indicates that the U.S. has difficulty tracking over $1 billion in weapons and equipment, with a significant portion of defense gear unaccounted for.

While there is evidence of corruption and monitoring challenges, the provided sources do not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The evidence highlights issues with tracking and accountability, but it does not quantify the extent of any potential arms sales.

To verify the claim, information is needed on the volume of arms sales, the specific armaments involved, and the recipients of these sales.

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

On December 28, 2024, Yahya Sare’e, the spokesperson for the Houthis, [announced](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1873057956704731540)
 that a Houthi surface-to-air missile shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) overflying the Al Bayda governorate in Yemen. Despite their protracted deployment, the number of US drones lost to hostile fire was minimal, with only three MQ-9 Reapers shot down by the Houthis between [2017](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/news/a28469/us-reaper-drone-shot-down-over-yemen/)
 and [2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-usa-drone-idUSKCN1VB180/)
.

During the Houthis’ anti-shipping campaign, there has been a marked escalation in the group’s tactical proficiency against US drones. Four days later, the Houthis [boasted](https://x.com/AmeenHa2024yan/status/1874346837530087576)
 the downing of a second US-made drone in the Marib governorate, marking the first Houthi strike of an MQ-9 Reaper in 2025.

These attacks represent the latest in a long string of successful Houthi strikes against US UAVs since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, showcasing the Houthis’ growing offensive capabilities. 

For the Yemeni militant group, imposing a heavy toll on the US drone fleet serves tactical, strategic, and symbolic goals at the domestic and regional levels. The strikes against MQ-9 Reaper drones impair US intelligence and targeting systems and help the Houthis shore up domestic and regional support. And, with the Houthis’ ties to China, Russia, and Iran, downed MQ-9 Reaper drones could end up in the hands of US adversaries. 

Given the benefits the Houthis continue to enjoy from shooting down these drones, the United States needs to adjust its drone deployment strategy to ensure that MQ-9 Reapers are less vulnerable to the militant group’s attacks. 

#### **The offensive**

The surge of attacks on US UAVs and the anti-shipping campaign are major pieces of the Houthi’s latest offensive. Since November 2023, the Houthis [have claimed](https://english.almasirah.net.ye/post/44879/)
 responsibility for downing fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones, in a series of attacks that have targeted US assets primarily in Marib and Sa’ada governorates. However, those designs are either variants of Iranian weapon systems or based on Iran’s technology, such as the Sayyad-2C (Hunter) missile, the Saqr series (Iran’s 358 missile), and the Barq missile family (Iran’s Taer series). 

#### **Inside the Houthis’ strategy**

Tactically, the Houthi shootdowns of MQ-9 drones primarily aim to blind the US intelligence and targeting systems. The Houthis’ efforts to conceal strategic sites have heightened the Western coalition’s dependence on UAVs to collect actionable intelligence on military installations.

For the Houthis, the shootdowns of US drones also hold symbolic value. Factual or not, these claims serve to inflate the Houthis’ perceived combat strength and burnish their image as a militia capable of confronting US forces head-on.

#### **The Houthis’ dangerous partners**

Although the MQ-9 Reapers have been shot down over Yemen, the negative ramifications of these Houthi attacks on US military assets could spill over beyond the country’s borders. In addition, US intelligence revealed that [Iran mediated talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. For instance, in mid-2019, Iran [rushed](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5529508,00.html)
 to retrieve a US Navy MQ-4C Triton that the IRGC [shot down](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/commodities/iran-shoots-down-us-military-drone-in-gulf-region-idUSL8N23R09Y/)
 over the Strait of Hormuz."

WASHINGTON — Houthi rebels in Yemen have shot down seven U.S. The drones were doing attack runs or conducting surveillance, and they crashed both into the water and onto land, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.

The U.S. has increased its attacks on the Houthis, launching daily strikes since March 15, when President Donald Trump ordered a new, expanded campaign. He promised to use "overwhelming lethal force" until the Houthis cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Houthi attacks on commercial vessels
------------------------------------

Main article: [Houthi attacks on commercial vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")

Houthi forces began attacking shipping vessels affiliated with [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 passing through the Red Sea on 19 November 2023. The video game's developers, [Bohemia Interactive](/wiki/Bohemia_Interactive "Bohemia Interactive")
, said that action taken against the videos was ineffective, saying: "With every video flagged, debunked, or taken down, ten more can be uploaded each day."[\[122\]](#cite_note-cbsnews20240605-130)
 Footage from the video game has also been misrepresented as attacks on shipping[\[128\]](#cite_note-136)
 and a US fighter jet being shot down by the Houthis over Sanaa.[\[129\]](#cite_note-137)

The **Red Sea crisis** ([Arabic](/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language")
: أزمة البحر الأحمر) began on 19 October 2023, when the [Iran-backed](/wiki/Iranian_support_for_the_Houthis "Iranian support for the Houthis")
 [Houthis](/wiki/Houthis "Houthis")
 in [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
 launched missiles and armed drones at [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
, demanding an end to the [invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
.[\[84\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20231219-92)
[\[85\]](#cite_note-AP14Jun2024-93)
 The Houthis have since [seized or bombarded dozens of merchant and naval vessels](/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels "Houthi attacks on commercial vessels")
 in the [Red Sea](/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea")
 and received hundreds of retaliatory air strikes by the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States")
 and allied forces.[\[86\]](#cite_note-Diakun-94)
 The crisis is linked to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
, the [Iran–Israel proxy war](/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_proxy_war "Iran–Israel proxy war")
, and the [Yemeni crisis](/wiki/Yemeni_crisis "Yemeni crisis")

[\[88\]](#cite_note-theguardian20240103-96)
[\[89\]](#cite_note-cnbc20240103-97)

Since 2014, the Houthis, who oppose [Yemen's internationally recognized government](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
, have controlled a considerable swath of the country's territory along the Red Sea. The sources also stated that Iran has escalated its provision of advanced drones, anti-ship cruise missiles, precision-strike ballistic missiles, and medium-range missiles to the Houthis, since the outbreak of the Gaza war.[\[3\]](#cite_note-hez-4)

US officials told _[Semafor](/wiki/Semafor_(website) "Semafor (website)")
_ that commanders and advisors from Iran's [Revolutionary Guards](/wiki/Revolutionary_Guards "Revolutionary Guards")
 are currently stationed in Yemen, and are directly involved in the Houthi attacks on commercial traffic in the Red Sea. The [Qods Force](/wiki/Qods_Force "Qods Force")
, has overseen the transfer of the attack drones, cruise missiles, and medium-range ballistic missiles which have been used in the strikes on Red Sea and Israeli targets in recent weeks.[\[1\]](#cite_note-semafor-2)

According to Western intelligence officials, the Iranian [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps](/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps")
 placed an intelligence gathering ship to guide Houthi attacks on ships that switch off radios and identifiers.[\[130\]](#cite_note-138)
 According to the Institute for the Study of War, this was likely [MV _Behshad_](/wiki/MV_Behshad "MV Behshad")
, which had replaced [MV _Saviz_](/wiki/MV_Saviz "MV Saviz")
 (which had been used to supply weapons and intelligence to the Houthis until it came under an Israeli [limpet mine](/wiki/Limpet_mine "Limpet mine")
 attack in April 2021).[\[131\]](#cite_note-139)
 The [Iranian](/wiki/Iranian_Navy "Iranian Navy")
 frigate [_Alborz_](/wiki/IRIS_Alborz_(72) "IRIS Alborz (72)")
 later also entered the Red Sea.[\[132\]](#cite_note-Al_Arabiya_English-140)

In July 2024, the [Defense Intelligence Agency](/wiki/Defense_Intelligence_Agency "Defense Intelligence Agency")
 reported that the Houthis used an Iranian-made missile in their attack on the Norwegian-flagged _Strinda_ on 11 December 2023. The officials did not elaborate on how Iran was helping the Houthis, but Michael Knights of the American think tank [Washington Institute for Near East Policy](/wiki/The_Washington_Institute_for_Near_East_Policy "The Washington Institute for Near East Policy")
 said the Houthis received Iranian surface-to-air missiles, such as the [358](/wiki/358_missile "358 missile")
 and [SA-2](/wiki/S-75_Dvina "S-75 Dvina")
, that allowed them to improve their air defenses and target US drones.[\[135\]](#cite_note-143)

#### North Korea

[Voice of America](/wiki/Voice_of_America "Voice of America")
 reported that [North Korea](/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea")
 may have shipped weapons to the Houthis via Iran based on [Hangul](/wiki/Hangul "Hangul")
 writing that was found on Houthi-launched missiles.[\[136\]](#cite_note-North_Korea-144)

#### China

Two China-based companies were sanctioned by the US in 2024 for providing "dual-use materials and components needed to manufacture, maintain, and deploy an arsenal of advanced missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against U.S."

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. More information is needed to verify the claim.

From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/us/drone-sightings-east-coast): 
Content: "The flying objects have been spotted over residential neighborhoods, restricted sites and critical infrastructure.

The sightings have put intense pressure on [federal agencies](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/politics/mysterious-drone-sightings-lawmakers-criticize-response/index.html)
 to provide more information about the aircraft, as officials have urged calm and emphasized there is no evidence suggesting the sightings pose a security threat.

The Biden administration has not identified “anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risks over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the Northeast,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Monday.

“We assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircrafts, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,” Kirby said. [](#maincontent)

Are drones spotted over NJ dangerous? And calls for military intervention.

This isn’t the plot of “War of the Worlds,” but rather the result of numerous possible drone sightings in recent weeks. While the FBI is still checking out 100 or so tips, none of them appear nefarious, he said.

“I can’t rule out the fact that we might find some sort of illegal or criminal activity, some nefarious activity, (but) all I can do is tell you that right now we see none of that,” Kirby said.

The US is sending drone detection and tracking systems to two military facilities in New Jersey, according to three defense officials Monday. The systems are in the process of moving to Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research facility, in northern New Jersey and Naval Weapons Station Earle in central New Jersey, the officials said.

Drones have been spotted near [Picatinny Arsenal](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, according to [military officials](https://x.com/USNorthernCmd/status/1866933937467166857)
 and [state lawmakers](https://x.com/SenBooker/status/1866607594837848396/photo/1)
. The sightings prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue temporary flight restrictions over the properties.

“Several instances of unidentified drones entering the airspace” were also reported above [Naval Weapons Station Earle](https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NWS-Earle/)
, a US Navy base south of Middletown, although no direct threats were identified.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy received a briefing from the FBI on Sunday night regarding the drone sighting investigation around Naval Weapons Station Earle, he said in [a post on X](https://x.com/GovMurphy/status/1868499153153855491)
."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:20>)
reverse_search(<image:20>)
web_search("drone shot down Houthis Russian missiles")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.64, 'Palestine': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.12, 'Jordan': 0.08, 'Tunisia': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:20>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones, with the Houthis claiming to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The article mentions that Iran mediated talks between Russia and the Houthis that led to Moscow supplying Russian-made advanced anti-ship cruise missiles to the group. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-strikes-on-us-mq9-reaper-drones/)

NPR reports that Houthi rebels have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. [Source](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/25/nx-s1-5377192/houthis-reaper-drones-us-military-yemen) The Wikipedia article discusses the Red Sea crisis, which began in October 2023, and mentions the Houthis launching attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and receiving retaliatory strikes from the US and allies. The Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs. The article also mentions the US Navy shooting down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis) <image:9764>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis have shot down US MQ-9 Reaper drones. The Atlantic Council reports that the Houthis have claimed to have downed fourteen MQ-9 Reaper drones since November 2023. The NPR article states that the Houthis have shot down 7 US Reaper drones in recent weeks. The Wikipedia article mentions that the Houthis use weapons of Russian, Chinese, or Iranian origin, including missiles and UAVs.

The image's location is most likely in Israel. The claim states that the image shows a US drone shot down by the Houthis. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the type of aircraft involved.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the Houthis have shot down US drones. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts a US drone shot down by the Houthis. More information is needed to verify the claim.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun offered condolences to the soldiers who were killed and injured, stressing that the military “is paying, in blood, the price of preserving stability in the south” of the country.

The deadly incident came as Israel has been carrying out near-daily attacks on Lebanon despite [a ceasefire reached](/news/2024/11/26/ceasefire-between-lebanons-hezbollah-and-israel-what-to-know)
 with Hezbollah in November.

It also coincides with a United Nations Security Council vote to wind down a UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has for decades been tasked with maintaining a buffer between Hezbollah fighters and Israeli forces.

The [mandate](/news/2025/8/28/un-security-council-renews-unifil-mission-in-lebanon-until-end-of-2026)
 for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was extended through the end of 2026, but after that, the UN will carry out an “orderly and safe drawdown and withdrawal” over the following year.

The resolution aims to make Lebanon’s military “the sole provider of security” in southern Lebanon, a goal complicated by Israel’s continued presence in the country. Both Israel and its top ally, the United States, have been pushing to end the UNIFIL mission.

“The process of withdrawing its 10,800 military and civilian personnel and equipment would start immediately in consultation with the Lebanese government, to be completed within a year,” Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr explained.

The US has also been pressuring Lebanon’s government to agree to a plan to disarm Hezbollah – something the Lebanese group has rejected, stressing that such a move will only reward Israel.

On a visit to Beirut on Tuesday, US envoy [Tom Barrack](/news/2025/8/28/us-envoy-says-calling-lebanon-reporters-animalistic-was-inappropriate)
 said Lebanon had agreed to present a plan aimed at persuading Hezbollah to disarm while Israel would submit a corresponding framework for its military withdrawal from the country.

Barrack said the plan, which is expected to be presented on Sunday, will not involve military coercion but focus on efforts to encourage Hezbollah to surrender its weapons.

A day earlier, Hezbollah Secretary-General [Naim Qassem said](/news/2025/8/25/hezbollah-chief-rejects-disarmament-demands-israel-comply-with-ceasefire)
 the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the ceasefire before talks on a national defence strategy could take place.

“If you truly want sovereignty, then stop the aggression."

Content: "(IRIB screenshot)

In an apparent first, an Israeli Air Force drone was shot down over the Isfahan area in central Iran overnight, the Israeli military and Iranian media said.

Footage broadcast by Iran’s state broadcaster IRIB on Wednesday morning showed what appeared to be a crashed Israeli Air Force Hermes 900.

“During operational activity, a surface-to-air missile was launched at an air force unmanned aerial vehicle,” the Israel Defense Forces said later, confirming the drone crashed in Iran.

The IDF said that “there is no fear of information leaking.”

The IAF has been operating over Iran, at a distance of more than 1,500 kilometers from Israel, since early Friday.

The military says it has air supremacy over western Iran and Tehran, and is working to extend it to other parts of the country, to thwart Iranian ballistic missile attacks on Israel.

More than 70 Iranian air defense batteries have been destroyed in strikes so far, according to the IDF.

> Video of wreckage of an Isralei Hermes drone shot down by the Iranian air defense in the Isfahan province this morning. We are constantly engaged in the struggle to maintain air superiority,” the military said.

The IDF said the incident over Isfahan was being investigated further.

The military has denied previous Iranian claims of shooting down Israeli aircraft, which were not backed by any evidence.

Several Hermes drones were [downed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-downs-idf-drone-over-south-lebanon-fires-heavy-rockets-at-north/)
 during the war with Iran’s proxy Hezbollah terror group.

Now in its sixth day, the Israeli operation in Iran was launched Friday with the objective of removing the “existential threat” of the Iranian nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities.

Israel says its sweeping assault on Iran’s top military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment sites, and ballistic missile program is necessary to prevent the Islamic Republic from realizing its avowed plan to destroy the Jewish state.

Iran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. [Skip to main content](#main-content)
