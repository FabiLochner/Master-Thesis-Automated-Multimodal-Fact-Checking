## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to The Guardian, Joe Biden approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China, and North Korea. The White House stated that the plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat. The article also mentions the US is concerned about China's expanding nuclear arsenal (![image 9775](media/2025-08-30_22-29-1756592947-504183.jpg)). The Lowy Institute states that in March, Joe Biden approved a classified nuclear strategic plan for the United States, reorienting the US deterrent strategy to focus on China's rapid expansion in its nuclear arsenal and to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia, and North Korea (![image 9783](media/2025-08-30_22-30-1756593019-423311.jpg), ![image 9784](media/2025-08-30_22-30-1756593025-647290.jpg)).
