The claim 'E! News reported that the United States Agency Aid and Development (USAID) paid millions for celebrities to visit Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. A fabricated video falsely attributed to E! News alleged that USAID paid celebrities to visit Ukraine. However, the video was debunked by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)) as part of a Russian disinformation campaign.

So, the overall veracity is: false
