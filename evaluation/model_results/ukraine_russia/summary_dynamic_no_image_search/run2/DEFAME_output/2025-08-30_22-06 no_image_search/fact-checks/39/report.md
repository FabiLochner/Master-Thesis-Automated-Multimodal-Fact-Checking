None of the sources mention White being on a Ukrainian hit list.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Jamie White, an Infowars writer, was shot in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones speculated that the killing "could’ve been a hit” orchestrated by Ukraine, while White's sister does not believe there is a larger conspiracy behind her brother’s killing. The Latin Times reports that White was found dead in a parking lot in Austin, Texas, with gunshot wounds, and the police believe the suspects were possibly burglarizing White's vehicle. Alex Jones claimed that White was on a Ukrainian hit list, and White's social media accounts indicate that he believed he was on a Ukrainian hit list. The "Investigate Earth Conspiracy Podcast" discusses the murder of Jamie White in Austin, Texas, and mentions that White may have been on a Ukrainian NGO hit list. ![image 782](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503177-996984.jpg), ![image 785](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503188-956198.jpg), ![image 791](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503192-610125.jpg), ![image 792](media/2025-08-06_17-59-1754503192-751914.jpg)
