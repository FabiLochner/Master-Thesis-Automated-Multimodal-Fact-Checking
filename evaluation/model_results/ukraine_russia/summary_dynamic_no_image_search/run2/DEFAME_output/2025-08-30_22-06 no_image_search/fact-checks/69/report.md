## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in question, ![image 21](media/69.jpg), appears on the Wikipedia article "East Slavic name" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Slavic_name)) and on the Wikimedia Commons ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasport_RF.jpg)). The Wikimedia Commons source describes the image as a Russian internal passport. The image also appears on a website discussing Russian internal passports ([https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/](https://ukrainian-passport.com/blog/internal-russian-passport/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
An AOL article from January 8, 2025, fact-checks the claim that the image shows Bashar al-Assad's Russian passport and states that the image is fake and photoshopped. The original passport image was found on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia article discusses Bashar al-Assad's presidency, including the Russian and Iranian interventions in support of his government, and mentions that Assad was granted political asylum by the Russian government. The article from NV.ua discusses the arrest of relatives of Bashar al-Assad at Beirut airport on December 28, who were attempting to leave using fake passports. ![image 21](media/69.jpg), ![image 2650](media/2025-08-07_20-52-1754599946-648145.jpg), ![image 2651](media/2025-08-07_20-52-1754599946-890665.jpg), ![image 2674](media/2025-08-07_20-58-1754600338-410139.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image is a photoshopped Russian internal passport. An AOL fact-check article explicitly states that the image is fake. The original image is available on Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows an authentic Russian passport of Bashar al-Assad is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL fact-check, confirm that the image is photoshopped. The original image is a Russian internal passport, but the details and the photo of Assad have been altered.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. An AOL fact-check ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-assad-passport-image-140122086.html)) confirms that the image is photoshopped. The original image is a Russian internal passport, but the details and the photo of Assad have been altered.
