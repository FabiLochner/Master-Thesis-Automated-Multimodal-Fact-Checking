## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In October 2024, the IMF published the World Economic Outlook, discussing global growth and structural reforms (![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_11-53-1755950009-342605.jpg)). The IMF held a meeting on October 24-25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. According to the statement by the Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Anton Siluanov, the Russian economy "continues to show consistently high growth rates, systematically surpassing most forecasts, including those of the IMF."

The Moscow Times reported on October 22, 2024, that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia (![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_11-54-1755950056-339449.jpg)). The IMF expects the Russian economy to expand by 3.6% in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the IMF published the World Economic Outlook in October 2024, which discussed the Russian economy. The Moscow Times reported that the IMF boosted its 2024 growth forecast for Russia. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the IMF declared Russia the fourth-largest economy in the world.

The evidence mentions the IMF's growth forecast for Russia but does not provide any information about the country's ranking in terms of economic size.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.
