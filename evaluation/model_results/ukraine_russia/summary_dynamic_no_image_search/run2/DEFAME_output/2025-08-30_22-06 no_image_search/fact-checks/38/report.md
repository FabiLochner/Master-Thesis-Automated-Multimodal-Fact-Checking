NBC News states that Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, was viewed by some Republicans as a signal of his preference in the November election. ABC News reports on a meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and Zelenskyy to discuss the war with Russia, mentioning Zelenskyy's visit to Washington and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers (![image 2061](media/2025-08-07_19-36-1754595394-652958.jpg), ![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris. News reports mention Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Some Republicans viewed the visit as a signal of his preference in the election. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy campaigned for Harris.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Zelenskyy's actions were perceived by some as potentially favoring Harris. However, the evidence does not confirm direct campaigning.

To fully verify the claim, information is missing regarding the specifics of Zelenskyy's actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meetings with U.S. lawmakers. Specifically, what did he say or do that could be interpreted as campaigning for Harris?

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Times Now News states that JD Vance claimed Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, referencing Zelenskyy's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in September. However, the article clarifies that Zelenskyy did not explicitly endorse Harris or any candidate during the visit, and includes a photo of Zelenskyy with Kamala Harris (<image:118637029>). Penn Capital-Star reports on the controversy surrounding Zelenskyy's Scranton visit, which led to accusations of election interference from Republicans. The White House and Pentagon defended the visit, stating it was requested by Ukraine, and that neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in the released materials (![image 9566](media/2025-08-30_22-13-1756591999-754978.jpg), ![image 9561](media/2025-08-30_22-13-1756591992-765185.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that while JD Vance claimed Zelenskyy campaigned for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, the visit to Scranton did not include an explicit endorsement of Harris or any candidate. The White House and Pentagon defended the visit, stating that neither Harris nor the election were mentioned in released materials.
