A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=122143466432378597&id=61561357930276)
 claims Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy bought deceased genocidal Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler’s home, the Eagle’s Nest.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence for this claim.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming Zelenskyy bought Hitler’s residence, known as the Eagle’s Nest. One user wrote that it was acquired by a company owned by Zelenskyy.

“According to German media, Kelsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle’s Nest, was acquired by the offshore company San Tommaso, owned by the President of Ukraine. If Zelenskyy had bought the Eagle’s Nest, media outlets would have covered it, yet none have. IMBY will take legal action against the authors of this misinformation,” reads the statement.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a joint press conference with the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Kyiv on February 10, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The deal was completed at the end of December, and the building was purchased for €14.2 million euros. The alleged purchase contract shown in the video is a fake, as is the alleged quote from the IMBY management. The Kelsteinhaus, located in the mountains of Bavaria, was a gift to Adolf Hitler on his 50th birthday."

Zelensky bought Hitler's Eagle's Nest residence in the Bavarian Alps — Mass media
=================================================================================

February 8th, 2025  
12:44

![](//img2.eadaily.com/c650x400/o/94e/7614af3a798ea9dbf663f5b6d4b54.jpeg)

Zelensky is Hitler today. It is alleged that Zelya bought the Kelsteinhaus mansion, also known as the Eagle's Nest, at the end of December.

The transaction amount amounted to € 14.2 million, the buyer was the offshore company San Tomaso SRL, owned by Zelensky. However, the detached Kelsteinhaus mansion in the mountains was extremely expensive to maintain, and therefore the Bavarian authorities decided to get rid of it.

The Eagle's Nest, presented to Hitler on his 50th birthday, was used by the German Fuhrer as the main headquarters from December 10, 1944 to January 15, 1945.

The building was practically not damaged during the Second World War and subsequently functioned as a tourist attraction — there is a museum and a restaurant.

Earlier, [**EADaily**](https://eadaily.com/)
 reported that the head of the Kiev regime, Vladimir Zelensky, is [not going](/en/news/2025/02/07/the-right-of-the-first-night-in-the-usa-zelensky-set-the-terms-of-the-deal-on-minerals)
 to give Ukraine's minerals to US President **Donald Trump** or other Western partners, it can only be about their joint development in close partnership.

Russian disinformation campaigns targeting the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, continuously spread fakes about him buying luxurious real estate while his country is suffering under Russian aggression. This time, pro-Russian sources produced a fake that says that Zelenskyy purchased a luxury villa on Saint Barthélemy island and already started building a bunker there. Important”), and others published the news that Volodymyr Zelenskyy supposedly bought a villa with a territory of 436 square meters on the island of Saint Barthelemy in France. The purchase agreement, then, was supposedly signed by Svitlana Pishchanko, who acted as a legal representative for the President of Ukraine. 

“News” also said that the local company Mancar is already building a bunker for Zelenskyy on the island. 

As evidence, Telegram authors referenced unknown French sources and attached a video with a French voiceover that includes several pictures of some real estate and a photo of a document’s pages (supposedly a purchase agreement). 

!зображення до посту: Debunking Russian fakes. No, Zelenskyy didn&#8217;t buy villa on &#8220;island of billionaires” <image:1552>

Next, we’ve researched the documents the news offers as evidence of the Stellae Villa purchase. No, Zelenskyy didn&#8217;t buy villa on &#8220;island of billionaires” <image:1553>

We wrote to Michel Ciffreo to ask about the authenticity of this document, and he told us that the document is fake. 

!No, Zelenskyy didn't buy villa on "island of billionaires”  <image:1554>

Responding to a [request](https://www.tf1info.fr/international/verif-non-guerre-ukraine-russie-volodymyr-zelensky-n-a-pas-achete-de-villa-luxueuse-a-saint-barthelemy-sibarth-real-estate-2343906.html)
 from a French TV channel TF1, the real estate company Sibarth Real Estate reported that they sold the villa in October 2024 and reiterated that the document is fake. 

They noted: “The buyer is not Altorante LTD, but a French company with French stakeholders that do not have any connection with Ukraine” and “on the territory of the villa, there are no \[repair works\], as opposed to what’s said in the video.” 

Conclusion: Fake

## Claim
Claim: "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest, or Kehlsteinhaus, in Berchtesgaden in the southern German state of Bavaria, for 14.2 million euros."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
One article from AOL, published on February 20, 2025, fact-checks the claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest and states that the claim is false, as the Eagle's Nest is still owned by the Free State of Bavaria. (<image:1524>) Another article from EADaily, published on February 8, 2025, claims that Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million through an offshore company. (<image:1548>)

A third article, published on February 27, 2025, by Yana Sliemzina, debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island, stating that the evidence is fake. (<image:1552>, <image:1553>, <image:1554>) The article also mentions that the claim was spread by Russian media.

The latest outburst from the Russian president regarding the supposed illegitimacy of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, dates back to March 28. On that day, the Kremlin leader proposed the creation of a "temporary government" in Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations, tasked with "hold\[ing\] democratic elections, to bring to power a viable government that enjoys the trust of the people." This was presented at the time as a necessary step to sign a peace agreement.

The statement did not surprise anyone in Kyiv, given the Russian president's habit of questioning Zelensky's legitimacy."

"That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also," Trump said.

Trump's claims indicated that he -- like Putin -- may now be seeking Zelenskyy's removal as part of any deal to end the war.

Putin appears to see removing Zelenskyy as a key goal, both as a victory he can present to Russians and as a potential opportunity to install a pro-Russian leader in his place. <image:360>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gives a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. The most recent, published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in early February, showed that 57% of respondents said they trusted Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy's level of support is diminished from the extraordinary highs of earlier in the war. The February poll did show a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.

Still, the 50% or more regularly scored by Zelenskyy in various polls is higher than those achieved by many democratic leaders around the world.

Aides in Kyiv were quick to point out on Wednesday that Zelenskyy's recent score of 57% in the KIIS poll was higher than Trump's backing in recent U.S. That is why the Russian president is pushing for elections to be held before any final peace deal.

Zelenskyy pushed back firmly on Wednesday, fact-checking Trump and saying he was suffering from exposure to Russian disinformation.

"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now it won't work," the president told reporters in Kyiv before a planned meeting with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg.

"If we are talking about 4% then we have seen this disinformation, we understand that it comes from Russia," he added. 18, 2025, in Palm Beach, Fla."

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

----------- A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

 with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

.

Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), used the trip to condemn his country’s policy on arming [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 as akin to making the country fight with one arm tied behind its back.

German chancellor [Olaf Scholz has resisted Zelenskyy’s requests for Germany’s Taurus cruise missile](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/uk-urges-germany-to-give-long-range-missiles-to-kyiv-despite-luftwaffe-leak)
, whose range and power he fears would dramatically escalate the conflict and potentially drag Germany into it more directly. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said.

The French president Emmanuel Macron caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus on the matter.

“Even if we get invited \[to Nato\], what happens then?"

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the case on Monday (9 December) for a diplomatic settlement to Russia's war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance.

The remarks at a joint press conference with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv's increasing openness to war negotiations, with Donald Trump preparing to return to the White House on 20 January.

The UNS president-elect, who has said he wants to end the war quickly, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to end the "madness", after he met Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron for talks in Paris.

A handout photo made available by the Presidential Press Service of Ukraine shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (3-L) holding a meeting with Friedrich Merz (3-R), Chairman of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, during their meeting in Kyiv, 9 December 2024. He suggested that some part of troops of a country be present on the territory of Ukraine, which would guarantee us security while Ukraine is not in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

"But we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the EU and when Ukraine will be in NATO," he added.

Kyiv, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join NATO, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion once the current hostilities are halted.

"If there is a pause while Ukraine is not in NATO, and even if we had the invitation, and we would not be in NATO, and there will be a pause, then who guarantees us any kind of security?" Zelenskyy asked at the press conference.

Russia has demanded that Ukraine abandon its NATO ambitions and sees Kyiv's membership of the alliance as an unacceptable security threat.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping to call outgoing US President Joe Biden in the coming days to discuss NATO membership.

December meeting with allies
----------------------------

Zelenskyy's spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said later that Kyiv was preparing a December meeting of key European partners who together with the US were "capable of ensuring the maximum strengthening of our state".

The aim was to develop a joint position that would hold strong both in negotiations and on the battlefield, he added.

Zelenskyy said he had discussed a "freezing" of the lines in the war when he met Macron and Trump. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today - while he is not yet in the White House," Zelenskyy said.

[Euractiv.com with Reuters](https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractiv-com-with-reuters/) Dec 10, 2024 06:45 4 min. Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory after launching the 2022 invasion that unleashed the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.

Zelenskyy said he told the two leaders that he did not believe Putin actually wanted to end the war and that the Russian president had to be forced to make peace.

"You can only exert force if Ukraine is strong. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield," he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

He received a rhetorical boost from Merz, the frontrunner in the election race to become Germany's next chancellor, who used his visit to liken Berlin's current policy to making Ukraine fight with one arm tied behind its back.

Foreign troops
--------------

Zelenskyy also returned to an idea raised in February by Macron, who floated the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine. There was no consensus on the matter among the European leaders.

French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated on Tuesday (5 March) that all options should be on the table in fighting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, warning, however, that being too transparent on the EU's next steps could hinder hopes for Ukraine’s victory.

"We can think and work on Emmanuel's position."

Zelenskyy says he is open to negotiated end to war with Russia
==============================================================

December 09, 2024 6:14 PM

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with Friedrich Merz, chairman of the German Christian Democratic Party, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Dec. We do seek it," the Ukrainian president said Monday at a joint press conference in Kyiv with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz.

Zelenskyy also said he is open to the possibility of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine to help his country end its war with Russia, a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly three years.

"But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO," Zelenskyy said.

On his Telegram channel, the Ukrainian leader said the deployment of troops to Ukraine would be a step forward for the Eastern European country’s quest to join NATO.

Zelenskyy’s openness to a negotiated end to the conflict with Russia and the presence of Western troops in Ukraine coincides with Russia’s recent gains in Ukraine and the upcoming inauguration of U.S. 9, 2024. President-elect Donald Trump.

Trump met with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said he plans to call U.S. President Joe Biden soon about Ukraine joining NATO.

"He is the current president, and a lot rides on his opinion. And there is no point in discussing with President Trump something that is not up to him today — while he is not yet in the White House,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump has said he wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly and has called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the largest conflict in Europe since World War II.

However, Zelenskyy told the _New York Post_ that while Trump wants a ceasefire, the two leaders have not discussed any details about that arrangement.

Merz, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's challenger in the upcoming German election, said at the joint address with Zelenskyy that the “basic consensus” in Germany is that Germany will continue to supply Ukraine with military aid.

In his meetings with Zelenskyy, Merz did, however, note that Germany’s position on Ukraine differs from the stance that France, the U.S. <image:4700>

LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - A Russian man serving time in prison for burning a copy of the Koran was found guilty by a court on Monday in a separate treason case and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

A regional court in Volgograd in southwestern Russia said it had convicted Nikita Zhuravel, 20, of state treason for corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation."

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Frussian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25%2F)

Zhuravel's case drew attention last year when Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov published video showing his son Adam, then 15, beating and kicking him while he was in prison in Chechnya awaiting trial for burning a Koran in Volgograd, his hometown.

Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Islamic faith in the overwhelmingly Muslim republic, where Zhuravel was transferred after what Russian investigators said was public pressure from Chechens.

The office of Russia's Prosecutor General said last month that Zhuravel had also been accused of sending footage of a freight train carrying warplanes, and information about the movements of a car linked to a Russian military base to a representative of Ukrainian intelligence.

Zhuravel had pleaded guilty to the crime, the court said in a statement on Telegram on Monday, adding that he had been opposed to what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Russia rarely comments on individual criminal cases.

Zhuravel is serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence following his [conviction](/world/europe/court-russias-chechnya-sentences-man-3-12-years-koran-burning-tass-2024-02-27/)
 in February under Russia's law against offending religious believers. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

!Court in Russia's Chechnya hears case of man who burned Koran copy <image:381>

Defendant Nikita Zhuravel attends a court hearing in the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russia, February 27, 2024. Investigators said he had confessed to publicly burning the Koran in a stunt paid for by Ukrainian intelligence.

It was not clear under what circumstances the alleged confession was made.

    A U.S. Treason cases, held behind closed doors, hardly ever result in an acquittal, official statistics show.

The number of such cases has risen sharply in Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine, as intelligence agencies pursue a crackdown on suspected foreign spies and agents.

Yevgeny Smirnov, a member of a Russian lawyers' association called Pervy Otdel (First Department) which has in the past helped defend people accused of treason, said Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, sometimes tries to entrap people.

He said the FSB contacts people known to be opposed to the war over the internet and encouraged them to commit crimes, such as setting fire to military buildings or sending sensitive information related to the Russian military.

Reuters could not independently verify his assertion. jury deadlocked on Wednesday on money laundering and sanctions evasion charges against the founder of Tornado Cash, a firm that makes cryptocurrency transactions harder to track.

It remains unclear whether Zhuravel pleaded guilty to the new treason charges. Never miss the latest news from Russia. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."

Man beaten in police custody for burning Quran gets 13.5 years for ‘treason’ against Russia in separate case
============================================================================================================

The man convicted this February of burning a copy of the Quran had another 13.5 years added to his prison sentence on Monday. Factoring in time already served, Nikita Zhuravel will spend the next 14 years incarcerated following a court ruling in Volgograd.

Police arrested Zhuravel in May 2023 for burning a Quran in front of Volgograd’s Cathedral Mosque, supposedly in coordination with Ukraine’s intelligence community, in an alleged scheme to incite sectarian conflict. In October 2024, several months after his first conviction, prosecutors charged Zhuravel with volunteering to collaborate with Ukraine’s security services. Officials accused him of providing Kyiv with videos of Russian military equipment and aircraft, including the movements of a specific vehicle in the unit."

Ukraine allies criticise G20 statement for not naming Russia’s role in conflict

Scholz, Starmer, Trudeau and Macron among leaders who say communique finalized by Lula ‘not strong enough’

[Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
’s western allies have criticised the final [G20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20)
 communique as inadequate for failing to highlight [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
’s invasion of its neighbour in 2022 as the conflict enters its 1,000th day.

The final agreed text from the summit in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil)
 was significantly weaker than [that of the previous year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/09/g20-leaders-agree-joint-declaration-after-deal-on-ukraine-statement)
, only highlighting humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the importance of territorial integrity.

The Ukrainian president, [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, accused G20 leaders of failing to act after his Russian counterpart, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, signed a decree easing Moscow’s rules for using nuclear weapons.

“Today, G20 countries are sitting in [Brazil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil)
. Starmer himself used a more diplomatic tone, saying it was important to include language on sovereignty but conceding that directly blaming Moscow was difficult while Russia was still part of the discussions.

Putin did not attend the summit in Rio de Janeiro for the third year running, but his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was at the meeting.

The weaker language will be a blow to Starmer, who spoke repeatedly about “doubling down on support for Ukraine” and said ahead of the summit that it was the top item on his agenda.

[Justin Trudeau](https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau)
, Canada’s prime minister, told reporters that G7 nations and “advanced economies” felt a much stronger statement was needed to reflect the “illegal invasion” of Ukraine by Russia. He said the final wording reflected the broader perspective of the G20 has broader perspectives, but said: “It’s not strong enough for me.”

Trudeau, whose government is bracing for a possible shift in relations following the re-election of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
, said the summit came “at a particularly challenging time in the world, for geopolitics but also for citizens all around the world”, because of inflation, war and climate change.

In such circumstances, finding consensus on the [G20](https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20)
 statement at the summit has proved especially challenging.

Communiques are typically issued at the end of a meeting, but Brazil’s president, [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva)
, came under fire for approving a final text a day early, while leaders of France, Germany and the United States were allegedly not in the room.

“The communique was closed by President Lula. Nothing,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference, accusing the G20 of failing to form a “strong strategy”.

[Olaf Scholz](https://www.theguardian.com/world/olaf-scholz)
, the chancellor of Germany, said he was disappointed that the communique did not make any reference to Russia’s role in starting the conflict.

“It is too little when the G20 cannot find the words to make it clear [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 is responsible,” he said at his press conference.

A spokesman for [Keir Starmer](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer)
, the UK’s prime minister, said the shift in language was “disappointing but not surprising”. Not least it includes representatives of the Russian government in attendance."

​​​​​​​**LONDON**

The Italian Prime Minister said Tuesday she understands the US approval of the use of long-range missiles for Ukrainian strikes inside Russia, but Italy made a different choice, according to Italian news agency, ANSA.

Giorgia Meloni told reporters at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that the US decision was a "response" to Russia's war against Ukraine.

She said, however, that Italy pledges "support" for Ukraine as long as there is a war there.

US President Joe Biden has allowed Ukraine to use US long-range missiles to strike deep inside Russia.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday in response that the use of Western missiles by Ukraine may be considered an attack by a non-nuclear state with nuclear support, potentially justifying Russia's use of nuclear weapons.

Moscow has revised its nuclear doctrine, reducing the barriers to deploying nuclear weapons in a conflict. 

"We have always been focused on the issue of anti-aircraft defense," said Meloni. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has declined an invitation from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to visit Ukraine, reaffirming Mexico’s commitment to neutrality in international conflicts. 

Zelensky had extended the invitation, hoping for an official Mexican visit to witness the effects of Russia’s invasion. <image:439>

Mexico played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. "My main task is to rule in Mexico; I will attend certain international events, which we consider important, but we will not travel much - our responsibility lies here," she stated, pointing to Mexico’s long-standing neutral and pacifist stance in global conflicts.

However, Sheinbaum, set to become Mexico’s first female president on October 1, firmly rejected the invitation. He expressed disappointment over Mexico's inclusion of Russian military personnel in its Independence Day parade and called for recognition of Ukraine’s struggle for independence. "Our Constitution is very clear, noble, and pacifist," she said.

Throughout his tenure, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) maintained a balanced stance on the Ukraine conflict, condemning Russia’s invasion while criticising the US for sending arms to Ukraine. Mexico has also refused to impose sanctions on Russia and declined to send military aid to Ukraine, despite requests from Ukrainian officials.

Nevertheless, it has played an active role in the United Nations, joining other countries in condemning Russia’s actions and co-sponsoring a resolution urging a ceasefire and protection for Ukrainian civilians. Domestically, however, support for the Kremlin has surfaced within Mexico’s governing Morena party, with some leftist members forming a "Mexico-Russia Friendship Committee" shortly after the war began.

Sheinbaum indicated that her administration would continue to focus on internal affairs, echoing AMLO’s approach of limited international travel."

Mexico’s President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum referred to an incident at the Mexican embassy in Ecuador in April as a “violation of sovereignty.” According to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-invites-putin-presidential-inauguration-russias-izvestia-newspaper-says-2024-08-06/)
, Mexico invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Sheinbaum’s inauguration ceremony on 1 October.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico has [called](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/08/08/ukraine-calls-on-mexico-to-arrest-putin-during-mexican-presidents-inauguration/?swcfpc=1)
 on local authorities to detain Putin if he visits, as Mexico recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). We will attend some international events that we consider important, but we will not travel much,”_ Sheinbaum said, emphasizing that her administration’s main task will be addressing domestic issues.

The President-elect reaffirmed Mexico’s commitment to maintaining diplomatic relations with all countries, with the exception of Ecuador. On 8 August, European Commission spokesperson Peter Stano said that the European Union had also urged Mexico to arrest Putin if he arrives in the country.

Mexico has rejected a request from Ukraine to arrest the Russian President if he attends the inauguration of Mexico’s next president on 1 October.

In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of abducting and forcibly deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. Since then, the Russian leader has avoided traveling to countries that have signed the Rome Statute due to the threat of arrest.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Mexico has urged Mexican authorities to arrest Putin if he visits, citing his war crimes indictment by the International Criminal Court, which Mexico recognizes.

López Obrador had previously rejected Ukraine’s request to arrest Putin.

Content: "‘war on drugs’ as poison to Mexico.

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum made this statement — “Start with your own country” — during her regular morning press conference Feb. In the cities of the United States, who sells the drugs that have wreaked such tragedy?”

President Sheinbaum knows what she is talking about, especially if one considers who the big winner is in the drug business. The secrets of drug trafficking, from Colombia to Chicago” — states that there are some 20 million drug users in the United States, of which some 6 million are addicts; however, it is dangerous to talk about the subject, so it is avoided, leading to total ignorance and confusion and the easy construction of stereotypes aimed at blaming the scourge exclusively on the producing countries.

Fernández Menéndez and Ronquillo explain that, after the shipments have crossed the border using all kinds of transport and also through tunnels along the entire border area, the drug trafficking networks begin to operate from 14 cities in the south in the states of New Mexico, Texas, California, Arizona, Oklahoma, Florida and Louisiana, where the drugs are smuggled. In the continuation of the controversy and in defense of Mexico’s best interests, three days later Sheinbaum reiterated that the United States must take responsibility for the serious problem of drug trafficking and drug consumption in its country.

The Mexican president explained that drug trafficking arises from the demand for drugs; as long as there is consumption, there will be supply. In this area, she insisted that the United States must also take charge of controlling its own generators of violence and domestic production of psychotropic substances and must make an effort to monitor and intervene in its illegal internal market.

It must also be said Claudia Sheinbaum showed her indomitable will and patriotic feeling in the conversation she had with the U.S. 7, Sheinbaum reported that she told Trump that it was crucial in the fight against drug trafficking that weapons from the U.S. But today, there are several countries and governments that support and defend the dignity and honor of their peoples.

Claudia Sheinbaum, just like the priests Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, just like Benito Juárez and Lázaro Cárdenas, is giving continuity to policies to recover decorum and consciousness of Mexican sovereignty initiated in this century by Andrés Manuel López Obrador. government’s use of the “war on drugs” as a pretext for intervention and exposes inconsistencies in Washington’s propaganda. The Mexican president then said: “They have a lot to do in the United States,” and asked, “How does fentanyl or any other drug get there? Already at the end of the 20th century, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimated the profit produced by international drug trafficking at close to $500 billion, more than half of which circulated through the U.S."

 is based in part on the idea that Mexico is the cause of the United States’ fentanyl addiction and to blame for a migrant crisis.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless.

Trump's talk of targeting Mexico is not only misguided, it’s downright reckless. It riles up the nativism in his MAGA followers and gives them the scapegoat they crave.

But that ignores that the United States is the world’s most lucrative illegal drug market, [estimated at $150 billion yearly](https://www.rand.org/news/press/2019/08/20.html)
 for the most common drugs, along with an [increasing use of fentanyl](https://time.com/6977717/fentanyl-pills-seized-study/)
. “Unfortunately, what we do have is the people who are being killed by the crime that is responding to the demand in your country.”

Drugs aren’t the only thing that U.S. Mexico also has enforced new visa requirements for those from Brazil, Ecuador, and Venezuela, and increased expulsions.”

That all happened under then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and his successor, Sheinbaum, [told Trump last week](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-mexico-president-sheinbaum-immigration-rcna182119)
 “that caravans weren’t arriving at the northern border because they are being served in Mexico.” In other words, Mexico continues to be the United States’ real southern border wall. This, despite Sheinbaum’s claim that “Mexico’s position is not to close borders but instead build bridges between government and people.” That might sound noble, but Mexico has benefited from being a complicit immigration enforcement partner with the U.S. That type of attitude led [to successes in decreasing drug fatalities](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-tariffs-overdose-opioid-epidemic-rcna182059)
 during the Biden administration."

United States President Donald Trump thanked Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drugs campaign, on which he pledged to spend “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

[Speaking at a Saudi Arabia-backed investment conference in Miami](https://x.com/jenarovillamil/status/1892377901682589986?s=46)
, Trump said he had spoken to Sheinbaum about drugs and she told him that Mexico is not a “consumer nation.”

> [#ULTIMAHORA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
> . — his “sweeping freeze on foreign aid has temporarily stopped U.S.-funded anti-narcotics programs in Mexico that for years have been working to curb the flow of the synthetic opioid into the United States,” [Reuters said in an exclusive report last week](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-stops-anti-fentanyl-work-mexico-2025-02-13/)
.

**‘Fentanyl kills’: Mexico’s anti-drug campaign**
-------------------------------------------------

In early January, [Sheinbaum officially presented a 300-million-peso (US $14.8 million) “national” and “permanent” anti-drugs campaign](https://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/presidenta-claudia-sheinbaum-presenta-campana-preventiva-nacional-y-permanente-alejate-de-las-drogas-el-fentanilo-te-mata)
 under the name “Aléjate de las drogas. (CBP Troy Miller/X)

The government of former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador [also ran an anti-drugs campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/fruitless-anti-drug-abuse-campaign/)
, and in early 2023 then deputy health minister Hugo López-Gatell was [announced as Mexico’s new addiction prevention “czar.”](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/lopez-gatell-addiction-czar/)

The current and former anti-drugs campaigns have [faced criticism for a range of reasons](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
, including because of the focus on fentanyl, which — as Sheinbaum has pointed out — is not widely used in Mexico, and because they have allegedly aroused interest in the synthetic opioid among users of other drugs.

“The main drug problem in Mexico is the use of methamphetamines,” [the news website Expansión reported earlier this month](https://politica.expansion.mx/mexico/2025/02/10/campana-fentanilo-por-presion-sin-politica-innovadora)
.

Health Minister David Kershenobich said last month that was “probably” the case, although he said that fentanyl “is the most significant” drug used in Mexico “in the sense of mortality and the harm it causes.”

Have something to say? President Donald Trump, who said Sheinbaum inspired his new anti-drug campaign](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump-696x464.jpg "sheinbaum-trump")](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/sheinbaum-trump.jpg)

Despite her status as 'the world's leading Trump whisperer,' President Sheinbaum and U.S. We have great family values,'” Trump said.

He noted that Sheinbaum — who he referred to as a “very wonderful woman” — also told him that Mexico spends a lot of money on anti-drug advertising.

“And I said ‘unbelievable.’ That was such a great conversation because we’re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars advertising how bad drugs are so that kids don’t use them — \[we’re going to say\] that they chew up your brain, they destroy your teeth, your skin, your everything. … We’re going to do a great advertising campaign saying how bad it is, how drugs are so bad for you,” he said.

Trump didn’t say exactly when he spoke to Sheinbaum about Mexico’s anti-drug advertising campaign.

Sheinbaum [said on social media in late November](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-responds-trump-claim-stop-migration-close-border/)
 that she had spoken to Trump about “the campaign we’re carrying out in the country to prevent the use of fentanyl.”

The U.S. Stay away from drugs, choose to be happy,” [says one video advertisement](https://x.com/SSalud_mx/status/1890611998871704013/video/1)
.

On the day the “Stay away from drugs campaign” was officially launched, [Sheinbaum asserted that the use of fentanyl “is not really a problem” in Mexico](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-fentanyl/)
.

While [fentanyl is used in Mexico](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/fentanyl-use-spreads-deeper-into-mexico-worrying-authorities-2024-02-20/)
 and there have been deaths linked to the powerful synthetic opioid here, “there is not a crisis like there is in the United States,” she said.

“… We don’t want \[the overdose crisis\] to reach our country, and that’s why we’re starting this campaign against fentanyl,” Sheinbaum said.

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa expresses fear and distaste at how Trump treats Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

After Friday's contentious meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the White House was sent a letter. His letter was signed by dozens of other former Polish political prisoners.

ANDRZEJ BOBINKSI: Nobody wants to say anything too vivid, too aggressive towards, you know, Donald Trump and the United States. And I think that, you know, by the end of Donald Trump's term, Poland will be in a very different place.

SCHMITZ: And Walesa's scathing letter, says Bobinski, is a sign of Poland turning away from its longtime friend. As NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz reports, the letter expressed to the Trump administration what the Polish government cannot.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The letter begins with your excellency Mr. and its historical antipathy towards Russia.

BOBINKSI: Donald Trump is way too lenient and way too friendly towards Vladimir Putin. And I don't think anybody has come out outright and said that we don't want to be friends with the United States anymore.

SCHMITZ: Certainly not Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, who made this statement after the Oval Office incident.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK: (Speaking Polish).

SCHMITZ: "I know a narrative is being created, especially after that very strange Friday at the White House," said Tusk, "that would divide Europe and the United States. It goes on to compare Trump and Vance's treatment of Zelenskyy to interrogations by political police under communist Poland, and it demands more respect for a leader whose soldiers are shedding blood to defend the free world. We do not understand, the letter says, how the leader of a country that is a symbol of the free world cannot see that. The author is Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, the first Democratically elected president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his leadership in opposing communist rule. "We cannot allow that to happen," he said."

WARSAW — Poland’s democracy hero Lech Walesa and dozens of other former political prisoners in Poland have written a letter to President Trump, telling him that his treatment of Ukraine’s president at the Oval Office last week filled them “with horror and distaste.”

Walesa, who served as president soon after Poland embraced democracy, and the others tell Trump that they found it offensive that he expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show respect and gratitude for the materiel assistance the United States has given Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

“Gratitude is due to the heroic Ukrainian soldiers who shed blood in defense of the values of the free world. Copyright © 2025, Los Angeles Times | [Terms of Service](https://www.latimes.com/terms-of-service)

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

Ukraine's president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
, and Head of the Presidential Office, [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 proposed in November 2022 a 10-point peace plan,[\[26\]](#cite_note-kp10point-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-ajz1-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
 consisting of:

*   A ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine
*   Restoration of Ukraine's borders prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea
*   Release of prisoners and return of [Ukrainian children deported to Russia](/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War")
    
*   Protection and restoration of [Ukraine's energy infrastructure](/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present) "Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)")
    
*   Protection of [food distribution](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022–2023 food crises")
    
*   Nuclear safety, including transfer of [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant_crisis "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant crisis")
     to the [IAEA](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency")
    
*   Environmental safety, including [demining](/wiki/Demining "Demining")
     and remediation of ecological damage caused by the [destruction of the Kakhovka Dam](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam "Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam")
    
*   Prosecution of [Russian war crimes](/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
    
*   Security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future aggression
*   A multilateral peace conference and peace treaty

Two months before the invasion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 dismissed the idea that declaring [neutrality](/wiki/Neutral_country "Neutral country")
 would prevent Russian aggression. The agreement was however blocked by Putin, who "expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory".[\[21\]](#cite_note-Reuters14092022-21)
 A Kremlin spokesman denied the story.[\[47\]](#cite_note-moscowtimes-deal-47)

### Belarus and Antalya peace talks

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 and Belarusian president [Alexander Lukashenko](/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko")
 agreed on 27 February that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian officials in Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, without preconditions.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)
 It was reported that Lukashenko assured Zelenskyy that all planes, helicopters, and missiles on Belarusian territory would remain on the ground during the negotiations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

Talks began on 28 February at one of Lukashenko's countryside residences near Liaskavičy, about 30 miles from the [Belarus-Ukraine border](/wiki/Belarus-Ukraine_border "Belarus-Ukraine border")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Ukrainian delegation was led by [Davyd Arakhamia](/wiki/Davyd_Arakhamia "Davyd Arakhamia")
 and included defense minister [Oleksii Reznikov](/wiki/Oleksii_Reznikov "Oleksii Reznikov")
, presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
, and others. The Ukrainians wanted a peacetime army of 250,000; the Russians demanded a maximum of 85,000, which is much smaller than the standing army Ukraine had before the invasion.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Russians also demanded severe limits on the amount and kinds of weaponry Ukraine could have, without any limits on Russia's military.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)

A third disagreement was the Russians' new demands for Ukraine to revoke several of its domestic laws, dealing with [contentious aspects of Soviet-era history](/wiki/Decolonization_in_Ukraine "Decolonization in Ukraine")
, such as the role of Ukrainian nationalists in World War II. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](/wiki/Antony_Blinken "Antony Blinken")
 insisted that Ukraine continue fighting in response to Milley's statement.[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)
 Ukraine presented the detailed [10-point peace proposal](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 later in November at a [G20](/wiki/G20 "G20")
 meeting.[\[129\]](#cite_note-AJE_Zelenskyy_10pt_plan-129)
 In December, Ukrainian foreign minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 suggested a February 2023 peace summit at the UN mediated by secretary-general [António Guterres](/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres")
 to which Russia would only be invited if it faced an international court for war crimes.[\[130\]](#cite_note-ap221226-130)
 Later that month, Russian officials said it would only resume peace talks with Ukraine if it recognized Russian sovereignty over the annexed regions.[\[22\]](#cite_note-voa221230-22)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-131)
 Peskov said in January 2023 that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."[\[132\]](#cite_note-132)

[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 On 24 February, China's government published a 12-point paper of "[China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis](/wiki/China%27s_Position_on_the_Political_Settlement_of_the_Ukrainian_Crisis "China's Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukrainian Crisis")
", receiving mixed responses from Western leaders.[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)

[\[137\]](#cite_note-137)
 At the [UN General Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly "United Nations General Assembly")
, China's deputy ambassador to the UN proposed a plan involving a ceasefire, dialogue, security guarantees for Russia, protection of civilians, and the upholding of territorial integrity; China also said that the West had exacerbated the conflict by supplying Ukraine with weaponry.[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
 Zelenskyy said that "I plan to meet Xi Jinping and believe this will be beneficial for our countries and for security in the world", though a time or place for a meeting was not set.[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 The spokeswoman of Russia's foreign ministry, [Maria Zakharova](/wiki/Maria_Zakharova "Maria Zakharova")
, said Russia appreciated China's efforts to resolve the conflict and was "open to achieving the goals of the [special military operation](/wiki/Special_military_operation "Special military operation")
 by political and diplomatic means" but that it would entail recognising the "new territorial realities" of Russia's annexations.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
 Peskov said that for now, we don't see any of the conditions that are needed to bring this whole story towards peace."[\[142\]](#cite_note-chinese-peskov-142)

 with Putin during Xi's [2023 visit to Russia](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")

Chinese foreign minister [Qin Gang](/wiki/Qin_Gang "Qin Gang")
 said sanctions and political pressure would not resolve the conflict, which he said "seems to be driven by an invisible hand pushing for the protraction and escalation", and that "the process of peace talks should begin as soon as possible".[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
 Xi said that China's peace proposal reflected world opinion ahead of [his visit to Russia on 20–22 March 2023](/wiki/2023_visit_by_Xi_Jinping_to_Russia "2023 visit by Xi Jinping to Russia")
.[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 Blinken responded by saying "the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms."[\[145\]](#cite_note-guardian230321-145)
 On 26 April 2023, over a month after Xi's summit with Putin, Xi Jinping held a phone call with Zelenskyy.[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)
 The Chinese readout of the Xi–Zelenskyy call included little concrete information about the start of a peace process;[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)
 in May, European officials criticized China's peace plan as an attempt at "freezing" the conflict in place and splitting the West in pushing Ukraine to a ceasefire.[\[148\]](#cite_note-wsj230526-148)
 Earlier, Peskov had said that Russia has "to achieve our goals" and that "Right now this is only possible by military means."[\[149\]](#cite_note-149)

In April 2023, some Ukrainian officials said they would be willing to discuss the status of Crimea.[\[150\]](#cite_note-150)
[\[151\]](#cite_note-foreignpol230411-151)
 That month, Brazilian president [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva "Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva")
 suggested that Ukraine should "give up Crimea" in exchange for Russian withdrawal from all territory it has occupied since February 2022.[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity but said that Zelenskyy "cannot want everything";[\[152\]](#cite_note-:15-152)
[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)
 he said Brazil advocates a "negotiated political solution to the conflict" and expressed concern over "global consequences" of the war "in terms of [food](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises "2022–2023 global food crises")
 and energy security".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Brazilian foreign policy adviser [Celso Amorim](/wiki/Celso_Amorim "Celso Amorim")
 said "the ideal peace for the Ukrainians and the Russians" required "concessions".[\[154\]](#cite_note-aljazeera-brazil-154)
 Ukraine rejected Lula's proposal.[\[155\]](#cite_note-155)
 Lula said after visiting China that "the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace", to which U.S. Petersburg, Russian president Vladimir Putin rejected a ceasefire and peace talks with Ukraine due to the ongoing [Ukrainian counter-offensive](/wiki/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive "2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive")

 has ditched his call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, backing instead Russian President Vladimir Putin’s push for a permanent peace agreement. And my response to that is: That’s the point,” Pizzi said.

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

Kyiv, backed by the Europeans, has indicated that it is willing to recognize the current reality on the ground in order to stop the killing."

A timeline of territorial shifts during Russia’s war on Ukraine
===============================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Aug 18, 2025 2:27 PM EDT

Russia’s troops are continuing their slow war of attrition in eastern and northern Ukraine, even as the conflict enters a pivotal phase with a series of high-level meetings that are part of U.S. House of Representatives approves $61 billion package for Ukraine after months of delay.

May 10, 2024 — Russia launches a new offensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, capturing a string of villages and opening a new front in the war.

Aug. His election raises uncertainty as to whether Washington will continue to support Ukraine.

April 26, 2025 — Moscow says all Ukrainian troops have been forced out from Russia’s Kursk region. Several weeks later, Putin visits the area in a show of strength and is filmed speaking with local volunteers.

June 1, 2025 — Ukraine strikes airfields deep inside Russia by launching drones that have been secretly stored and transported across the country on the back of trucks. The attack is codenamed Operation Spider Web.

Summer 2025 — Russia and Ukraine both step up drone strikes with the ability to strike deep into each other’s territory.

June 30, 2025 — Russia says it has taken full control of Ukraine’s Luhansk, one of four regions that Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022. 24, 2022 — Russian President Vladimir Putin launches an invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south. Russian troops quickly reach Kyiv’s outskirts, but their attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast meet stiff resistance.

March 5, 2022 — Russian advances toward Kyiv and Kherson reach their height. The port city of Mariupol is surrounded.

April 2, 2022 — Ukraine defeats Russian forces in Kyiv after throwing them back in Chernihiv.

Aug. 30, 2022 — Russia illegally annexes Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, even though it doesn’t fully control either of the four.

September to November 2022 — Ukrainian forces reclaim vast parts of the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the first counteroffensive, including the city of Kherson itself.

May 22, 2023 — Russia claims control of Bakhmut after months of fighting.

June 6, 2023 — As Ukraine’s long-anticipated second counteroffensive starts, the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam explodes, sending a wall of water into southern Ukraine and upending Ukrainian battle plans.

Fall 2023 — The second Ukrainian counteroffensive ends, with little change to the front line.

Feb. 6, 2024 — Ukraine launches a lightning incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, holding territory along the border in an unexpected and embarrassing episode for the Kremlin.

**August 24, 2025, 8:15 pm ET** 

**Click** [**here**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375)
 **to see ISW’s interactive map of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov's continued insistence that any end to the war must address Russia's "root causes," including multiple times following the August 15 Alaska summit, continues to indicate that Russia's war aims have not changed.\[7\]

**Lavrov continued efforts to mischaracterize Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the impediment to an enduring peace in Ukraine, in order to distract from the Kremlin's own unwillingness to compromise or engage in negotiations on US President Donald Trump's proposed timeline.** Lavrov claimed that Zelensky "will not resolve the \[Kremlin's\] issue\[s\]" with Ukraine and accused Zelensky of publicly stating that "he is not going to discuss any territories," deliberately mischaracterizing Zelensky's recent public statements to the opposite.\[8\] Zelensky has repeatedly indicated in recent days that he is willing to discuss territorial issues in a bilateral meeting with Putin.\[9\] Lavrov claimed that Zelensky is going against Trump's wishes regarding NATO membership and is refusing to repeal laws relating to Russia's defined "root causes" of the war. Geolocated footage published on August 24 shows an explosion and fire near the refinery.\[25\] Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev claimed on August 24 that Ukrainian drones struck an unspecified "industrial enterprise" in Syzran City.\[26\] ISW recently observed reports from Russian business outlet _Kommersant_ indicating that Ukrainian long-range strikes campaign targeting Russian oil refineries are among the factors impacting Russia's fuel reserves and threatening oil revenues.\[27\] The Kremlin relies on oil revenues to fund its war in Ukraine, and Ukrainian long-range strikes continue to threaten Russia’s economic stability.

**Ukraine's Western partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, including through the purchase of US weapons.** Two US officials told the _Wall Street Journal_ (WSJ) on August 24 that the United States approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) air-launched missiles to Ukraine and reported that the systems will arrive in Ukraine in six weeks (about mid-October 2025).\[28\] The WSJ reported that the ERAMs are part of a mostly European-funded arms package for Ukraine that includes other air defense systems and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS). Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that more than C$1 billion (about $722 million) of the C$2 billion (around $1.44 billion) worth of military aid that Canada pledged to Ukraine in June 2025 will go toward the delivery of armored vehicles, drones, and ammunition that will arrive in Ukraine as early as September 2025.\[30\]

**Ukraine and Russia conducted another prisoner exchange that included a limited number of Ukrainian journalists and government officials on August 24.** The Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs) and the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported that Ukraine and Russia each exchanged 146 POWs.\[31\] Russia also released three civilians, two journalists, and former Kherson City Mayor Volodymyr Mykolayenko, and Ukraine also released eight Kursk Oblast residents. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) mediated the exchange.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used an English-language interview with a US outlet to reiterate the Kremlin's explicit rejection of US-proposed initiatives for peace in Ukraine.**
*   **Lavrov continued efforts to mischaracterize Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the impediment to an enduring peace in Ukraine, in order to distract from the Kremlin's own unwillingness to compromise or engage in negotiations on US President Donald Trump's proposed timeline.**
*   **Lavrov denied that Russia violated past international treaties prohibiting Russia from invading Ukraine and rejected Western-backed security guarantees for Ukraine in the future.**
*   **Ukrainian forces struck Russian energy infrastructure in Leningrad and Samara oblasts on the night of August 23 to 24.**
*   **Ukraine's Western partners continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, including through the purchase of US weapons.**
*   **Ukraine and Russia conducted another prisoner exchange that included a limited number of Ukrainian journalists and government officials on August 24.**
*   **Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Pokrovsk, and Russian forces recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast.**

**_We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because these activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. <image:9619>**\

[Ukraine](/topic/ukraine) ISW will cover subsequent reports in the August 25 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment.**

**Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used an English-language interview with a US outlet to reiterate the Kremlin's explicit rejection of US-proposed initiatives for peace in Ukraine.** Lavrov stated in an interview with NBC that Russian officials have explained Russia's war goals during meetings with Trump and other US officials and have also explained them publicly, signaling that public Russian statements about the war convey the same points that Russian officials aim to convey in private meetings.\[1\] Lavrov reiterated that Russia views NATO expansion and the alleged "violation of Russian security interests" as one of the "root causes" of the war.\[2\] Lavrov claimed that Russia will achieve its war aims, which he listed as the removal of security threats to Russia "coming from the Ukrainian territory," the protection of the rights of the "ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking people who believe they belong to the Russian culture and Russian history," and Ukrainian neutrality. Lavrov claimed that Ukraine has the right to exist but only as long as it "lets go" of ethnic Russians and Russian speakers who "decided that they belong to Russian culture."\[3\] Lavrov claimed that Russia has a "duty" to support and protect those who share the values of the Russian language and the "Russian World" ("Russkiy Mir").\[4\] Lavrov's statements in the NBC interview reiterate consistent Kremlin claims that the alleged "root causes" of the war are NATO's eastward expansion and Ukraine's discrimination against Russian speakers.\[5\] The Kremlin's "root causes" notably extend beyond Ukraine, and agreeing to Russia's demand that any future peace settlement "eliminate" the root causes would require substantial negotiations with NATO as well.\[6\] Lavrov is also promoting the narrative that Ukraine is part of the Kremlin's "Russkiy Mir" idea - an amorphous ideological and geographic conception that Russia claims includes all of the former territories of Kyivan Rus, the Kingdom of Muscovy, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the contemporary Russian Federation. Lavrov asked why Zelensky is "ready to meet" and implied that any Zelensky-Putin meeting would be useless, suggesting that Putin is unwilling to meet with Zelensky unless Ukraine concedes to Russia's original war demands, which amount to Ukraine's military, political, and cultural capitulation.\[10\]

Lavrov also undermined Zelensky's legitimacy as part of efforts to justify Russia's refusal to engage in the peace process and to sign a peace deal with Ukraine. The Budapest Memorandum does state that Russia, the UK, and the United States are committed to not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, such as Ukraine.\[14\] Lavrov's claims ignore, however, that the memorandum also states that Russia, the UK, and United States are committed to "respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine."

Lavrov claimed that Western states, which Lavrov alleged prepared a "coup" in Ukraine in 2014 (in reference to Ukraine's democratically organized Revolution of Dignity) and support a "Nazi" government in Kyiv (in reference to Ukraine's democratically elected government), should not be allowed to be responsible for Ukraine's post-war security – a rejection of the US- and European-backed security guarantees for Ukraine currently under discussion.\[15\] Lavrov claimed that he never stated that Russia must have a veto over security guarantees for Ukraine but that there should be a consensus on such guarantees and take into account Russia's interests."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, with Donald Trump playing a role. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on August 24, 2025, that the Russian Foreign Minister rejected US-proposed peace initiatives. This indicates that a peace deal had not been reached by late August 2025.

The Wikipedia timeline for January-May 2025 mentions peace negotiations, but it does not explicitly state that a deal was reached.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

In the wake of the 12-day war that Israel fought against Iran, the main focus between the two leaders was expected to be how to wind down Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that began close to two years ago. Accessibility links

![Gaza war looms over Netanyahu White House meeting with Trump](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Netanyahu is slated to meet Tuesday with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for," Netanyahu said.

'It changes from day to day'
----------------------------

White House officials are urging Israel and Hamas to quickly seal a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom are believed to be living.

Leavitt announced on Monday that Witkoff will travel later this week to Doha, Qatar, for ceasefire and hostage talks.

But a sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. President Donald Trump will meet Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran.

Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://abc7.com/tag/Benjamin-Netanyahu)
 and U.S. President [Donald Trump](tag/Donald-Trump)
 might look to take a victory lap on Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success.

But as they meet at the White House for the third time this year, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Trump will push for an end to the conflict.

Trump has made clear that following last month's 12-day war between Israel and Iran he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon. But that's not always been the case.

As recently as Netanyahu's last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.

Trump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer, Matthew Lee, Lisa Mascaro and Aamer Madhani contributed reporting._

Netanyahu’s Visit to the White House Highlights Critical Foreign Policy Issues

**Bottom Line Up Front**

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, although it is unclear whether key obstacles – such as Iranian support for its proxies or its ballistic missile program – will prove insurmountable.

**Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. Netanyahu is buoyed by his recent meeting with [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-april-7/)
, who welcomed Netanyahu and announced that Budapest would be withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has sought indictments for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their role in Israel’s war in Gaza. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth promised would be unrelenting.

During the meeting in the White House, Trump revealed that the United States was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, while Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Aragchi called them “indirect, high-level talks,” which are scheduled to begin on Saturday in Oman. Just recently, former UK ambassador to Iran, Sir Richard Dalton, said that the risk of war with Iran has “never been higher.” Referring to a possible military strike on Iran, if an agreement cannot be reached, Trump said, “So we are going to see if we can avoid it, but it’s getting to very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not propose to resettle Gaza residents to Ukraine or Syria.

On April 7, 2025, after meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, Benjamin Netanyahu [made a statement](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-says-other-countries-want-to-take-gazans-in-trump-says-gaza-a-death-trap/)
 that was misinterpreted and quickly spread on social media. In reality, the Israeli Prime Minister was [comparing](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=522826137312227)
 the situation of Gaza people to the situation of the population in other war zones, including Ukraine and Syria, where people were able to leave the country.

In particular, Netanyahu [said](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=522826137312227)

«While Ukrainians flee to Europe, the West decides where to settle migrants from Palestine,» — this is how the propaganda comments on this news.

! And in any other place where there was a clash, I mean, whether it was Ukraine, Syria or anywhere else, people could leave. You know, the people of Gaza were locked up. Gaza was the only place where they were locked up. What’s wrong with giving people a choice?»_

It is also worth noting that while discussing real plans for the possible resettlement of Palestinians, other countries were indeed mentioned, such as Somalia, Morocco, and Sudan. Yet Ukraine was never mentioned in this context."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says talks are underway with several countries about taking in Palestinians displaced by [the war in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/middleeast/anas-al-sharif-al-jazeera-reporter-intl)
.

The countries involved are South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia, a senior Israeli official told CNN. In exchange for taking in some of Gaza’s population of more than two million people, the official said the countries are looking for “significant financial and international compensation.”

On Wednesday, South Sudan rejected an [Associated Press report](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/middleeast/israel-in-talks-to-resettle-palestinians-from-gaza-in-south-sudan-ap-intl)
 that it was in discussions about the resettlement of Palestinians, saying in a statement the reports were “baseless and do not reflect the official position” of the country. Earlier this year, Somaliland also said there were no such talks.

And last week, Indonesia said it was ready to take in 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza for treatment but that they would return to Gaza once they recovered.

It’s unclear how advanced any of these discussions are and whether they are likely to come to fruition.

Netanyahu has never given a detailed vision of what will happen to Gaza after the war but has repeatedly advocated for resettling displaced Palestinians in other countries, particularly after President Donald Trump floated the idea early this year. It is also often used as a reference to Biblical Israel, which would include parts of today’s Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.

The comments were greeted by sharp statements from several Arab states, which condemned the use of the term as provocative and counterproductive to peace.

Egypt “demanded clarifications” on the use of the term, “given its implications of provoking instability and reflecting a rejection of the pursuit of peace in the region, as well as an insistence on escalation,” according to a foreign ministry statement.

Saudi Arabia said it “expresses its outright rejection of the settlement and expansionist plans adopted by the Israeli occupation authorities.”

Qatar said the use of the term is considered “an extension of the occupation’s approach based on arrogance, fuelling crises and conflicts, and blatantly infringing the sovereignty of states.”

Gal and Netanyahu’s conversation about “Greater Israel” did not appear on the official channel’s full interview, but a longer version with Netanyahu’s comments was posted on [Gal’s account on X](https://x.com/sharongal/status/1955343897963442437)

Ad Feedback But even as Trump appears to be cooling on the proposal, Israeli officials have embraced it.

In an interview published on Tuesday, Netanyahu said, “we are talking to several countries” without naming them.

Netanyahu claimed in the interview with Israeli network i24 that the plan was “not pushing out” Palestinians but would instead be “allowing them to leave.”

“All those who say they’re concerned for the Palestinians and want to help Palestinians,” Netanyahu said should “open their doors.”

“Why are they coming and preaching to us?! Open your doors,” he added.

The comments come as international alarm grows over Israel’s stated plan to take over Gaza City, home to more than one million Palestinians, including many already displaced by the war.

The densely populated city has continued to be hit by Israeli strikes with at least 123 people killed over the last 24 hours across Gaza, according to a tally on Wednesday from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.

More than 100 humanitarian organisations meanwhile called on Israel to end what they called the weaponization of aid in Gaza, saying vital relief was not being allowed in while the territory is gripped by starvation.

Shaina Low, Communications Adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said any plans to relocate Palestinians, whether within Gaza or to foreign countries, was “a non-starter.”

“They aren’t acceptable under international law. And they should not be acceptable to the international community,” Low told CNN.

A ‘Greater Israel’
------------------

During the interview, Netanyahu was also asked by i24News network anchor Sharon Gal whether the prime minister “connects” to the vision of a “Greater Israel,” to which he responded, “Very much.”

The term “Greater Israel” refers to a state of Israel that is beyond the borders that exist today."

During yesterday’s [White House meeting](https://www.timesofisrael.com/blair-and-kushner-join-trumps-gaza-meet-official-calls-it-a-simple-policy-session/)
 on the future of Gaza, US President Donald Trump called Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer into the meeting while it was already in progress to set out Israel’s needs for the “day after” Hamas, Channel 12 reports.

Dermer, a top confidante of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told Trump that Israel does not want to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip or deport Gaza’s residents, according to the report. (Chaim Goldberg/Flash90)

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calls on the government to begin annexing parts of the Gaza Strip if Hamas stands by its refusal to lay down its weapons.

The far-right minister, who has vocally opposed striking a deal with Hamas to end the nearly two-year war, presents his plan to “win in Gaza by the end of the year” at a press conference in Jerusalem.

Under Smotrich’s proposal, Hamas would be given an ultimatum to surrender, disarm and release the hostages still held in Gaza since the group’s October 2023 attack that triggered the war.

If Hamas refuses, Smotrich says Israel should annex a section of the territory each week for four weeks, bringing most of the Gaza Strip under full Israeli control.

According to Smotrich, Palestinians would first be told to move south in Gaza, followed by Israel imposing a siege on the territory’s north and center to defeat any remaining Hamas terrorists there, and ending with annexation.

“This can be achieved in three to four months,” he claims, calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “to adopt this plan in full immediately.”

[![IDF troops operate in the Gaza Strip, in a photo cleared for publication, on August 28, 2025. Israel will continue to ensure that these gains are not eroded and that the security of the residents of the north is safeguarded,” he continues.

The Foreign Ministry adds that ahead of the Security Council discussion on UNIFIL, it “coordinated interagency preparations together with the IDF and the National Security Council,” and held talks with “key international partners,” in efforts it claims led to the decision to end UNIFIL’s mandate.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, celebrates the “good news” in a video message, saying UNIFIL “has failed in its mission and allowed Hezbollah to become the region’s most serious threat.”

“The Lebanese government now needs to take responsibility and ensure that no other force is present on its border with Israel,” he adds.

The mandate is set to formally expire in December 2026, with UNIFIL troops scheduled to withdraw from Lebanon during 2027.

While Israel had pushed for the observer force’s mandate to be terminated even sooner, arguing it had not sufficiently acted against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, its ally the US ultimately joined the rest of the Security Council in backing UNIFIL remaining in Lebanon for another year.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s defense attorneys in his corruption trial tell the Jerusalem District Court that they will not be able to continue to represent him if the court ramps up proceedings to four times a week, as it has demanded.

The Jerusalem District Court [judges announced](https://www.timesofisrael.com/court-says-netanyahu-to-testify-3-times-per-week-from-november-to-speed-up-trial/)
 earlier this month that four hearings per week will be held starting in November, and Netanyahu will testify in three of them until the end of his cross-examination, “in light of the current need to advance the trial.”

Chief defense attorney Amit Hadad tells the court that the decision will “severely harm” their ability to represent other clients and the “freedom of the defense team to practice,” threatening to resign if it moves ahead with the decision.

Hadad asks the court to schedule a hearing on the matter in the presence of Netanyahu.

Netanyahu’s trial on three charges of corruption has been ongoing since May 2020, with the prime minister’s testimony beginning in November 2024, although many hearings have been delayed and canceled due to his schedule.

The trial is expected to take at least another several years, though multiple unsuccessful efforts have been made to reach a plea deal that would end proceedings.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office denies as “fake news” a report by the Kan public broadcaster that Israel seriously considered ceding the Mount Dov area in exchange for Syria giving up its claim to the Golan Heights in security talks with Damascus weeks ago.

“The claim that Israel supposedly considered handing over Mount Dov is absolute fake news,” the PMO says in response to the report.

The report concerned the Mount Dov region, an area on the Golan’s border also known as the Shebaa Farms, which is claimed by Israel, Lebanon and Syria.

According to Kan, Israel examined the possibility of transferring the area in return for Damascus suspending its sovereignty claim to the Golan, which Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed. (IDF)

Another accuser has come forward alleging sexual misconduct by International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan.

In a [report from](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/28/second-woman-accuses-icc-chief-prosecutor-karim-khan-of-sexual-misconduct)
 the Guardian, an unnamed woman who worked for Khan in 2009 said that he “behaved inappropriately, subjecting her to unwanted sexual advances, abused his authority over her, and repeatedly sought to pressure her into sexual activity.”

She described his behavior as a “constant onslaught” of advances.

Khan, who was responsible for pursuing ICC arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, temporarily stepped aside from his role earlier this year after other allegations emerged of sexual misconduct in the past two years.

His associates have tried to paint the allegations as a pro-Israel smear campaign, although the Guardian says there is “no evidence” of such a plot.

From [Source](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/): 
Content: "This is stated in the information on the publication’s website.

Thus, the fake cover allegedly contains the magazine’s release date – March 20, 2025 and the serial number of the magazine – 1705.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?resize=708%2C593&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/anh2-1.jpg?ssl=1)

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish a magazine on March 20 with such a number. It was falsified based on the real cover of the publication, which was published on March 19, 2025.

In terms of content, this fake is aimed at humiliating and discrediting the Ukrainian president, who allegedly has no political future, and his dreams of an independent Ukraine are unattainable.

**Russian propaganda continues to exploit the topic of fake covers of Western publications, which mock Ukraine or the Ukrainian leadership in the form of caricatures. So, the previous 1703rd issue was published on March 12, 2025 ([https://surl.li/srmwfu](//surl.li/srmwfu)
), and the 1702nd – on March 5, 2025 ([https://surli.cc/tefpcg](//surli.cc/tefpcg)
).

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?resize=708%2C417&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar3-2.jpg?ssl=1)

In addition, the upcoming issue of the magazine cannot contain a caricature of the president of Ukraine either – both the original cover and the fake one have an image of the announcement of the next issue of the magazine and its cover in the upper corner. For example, the other day, the cover of the French humorous publication Charlie Hebdo actively went viral in the Russian segment of Telegram – such a post was spread by one of the top Russian propaganda channels “Ukropsky Fresh” ([https://surl.li/kcqnza](//surl.li/kcqnza)
), the anti-Ukrainian resource “Drugaya Ukraina” ([https://surli.cc/blivly](//surli.cc/blivly)
), as well as the Kremlin’s top propagandist Solovyov ([https://surl.li/ksrqfa](//surl.li/ksrqfa)
). This time, the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine has been falsified.

[![](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?resize=708%2C592&ssl=1)](//i0.wp.com/without-lie.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/home/dr343163/without-lie.info/www/shar2-3.jpg?ssl=1)

The cover, which was distributed by Russian propaganda Telegram channels, depicts a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is allegedly lying in a coffin. The cover contains a humiliating inscription, namely: “A political corpse is taking its last breath,” and the phrase “Ukraine is an independent state” is supposedly flying from the image of Zelensky himself.

However, Charlie Hebdo did not publish such an issue of the magazine with such a cover. 1704 for March 19, 2025 ([https://surl.li/qgqsaf](//surl.li/qgqsaf)
). And it has a completely different picture.

Accordingly, it can be stated that the publication in Russian Telegram channels of the cover of Charlie Hebdo magazine with a caricature of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a fake. Further in the material about why it is fake.**

**Fake**

As already noted, Russian propaganda actively exploits the topic of mocking Ukraine, Ukrainians and the leadership of the Ukrainian state through fake covers of famous Western publications."

 claiming to be the cover of a weekly issue of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. According to the alleged cover, the Ukrainian president says from the coffin, “Ukraine is an independent state.” The image also includes a date – March 20, 2025 – as the release date of the magazine issue.

 [! Consequently, the alleged issue date is also falsified, as the satirical magazine did not publish any issue on March 20. It is noteworthy that after this, the fake cover photo, translated into Italian from Solovyov’s post, was actively shared by Italian-speaking users on social media.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine and started a full-scale war on February 24, 2022, the forging of magazine covers to discredit Ukraine or its leaders has become an active part of Russian disinformation campaigns."

#### [Ukraine](/country/ukraine/)

An alleged front cover from the French satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo is circulating online, mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis.

In the picture, we can see a caricature of Zelenskyy holding up the body of the late pontiff at the Vatican bank. Please transfer all of my money to Ukraine," the cartoon Zelenskyy says.

The accounts sharing the front cover and commenting on it are critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of demanding money from world governments and using Ukraine's defence against Russia's war as a pretext.

It's a common accusation that critics of Ukraine try to levy against the Ukrainian president in an effort to weaken support for Kyiv.

But this is all false: firstly, we can easily check whether the picture is authentic by visiting [**Charlie Hebdo's website**](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 — it's not anywhere to be found.

It was supposedly published on 23 April 2025, but checking Charlie Hebdo's list of recent publications shows us that the real 23 April edition looks completely different.

The edition number is also wrong: the real cover shows the number 1709, while the fake one is labelled 1710.

The real edition does deal with the pope's death, but instead mockingly says his successor will be "truly close to the poor" by depicting him as a rat.

The rat says: "What's more, I'm reactionary, misogynistic and homophobic."

Many of the accounts sharing the fake front cover online are pro-Russian and regular disseminators of Kremlin propaganda that attempt to discredit Ukraine.

Charlie Hebdo itself has previously [**issued a warning**](https://charliehebdo.fr/2022/09/societe/des-russes-font-des-fausses-unes-charlie/)
 that pro-Russian actors are using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

"Russian propagandists are creating fake Charlie Hebdo front pages to make it appear that the newspaper supports Putin," the magazine said.

"While the process isn't new — there are plenty of fake Charlie front pages — it's surprising to see it still working," it added.

 of false Charlie Hebdo editions that disparage Zelenskyy. In this one, Zelenskyy was depicted as Quasimodo, a character from Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", again as part of an effort to demean him and wider Ukraine by extension.

It's been widely shown that Russia is attempting to damage support for Ukraine by spreading propaganda that depicts Zelenskyy as a money-grabbing opportunist who's robbing taxpayers' funds.

This particular fake Charlie Hebdo front cover is especially striking because it combines two figures who have constantly fallen victim to deepfakes over the past few years: Zelenskyy and Pope Francis.

The former has become a prime target for misinformation in general ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Such false narratives, such as accusing him of prolonging the war and calling his motives for financial assistance into question, are amplified when even high-profile politicians worldwide, such as US President Donald Trump, [**have labelled him a "dictator"**](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/21/fact-check-what-is-the-truth-behind-trumps-claims-on-ukraine)
.

However, Western countries are providing legitimate financial and humanitarian support to Kyiv, and surveys [**consistently show**](https://www.statista.com/chart/34068/public-support-for-ukraine-aid-in-europe/)
 that a strong majority of European citizens back this.

BERLIN, Feb 14 (Reuters) - There must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Friday at the start of the Munich Security Conference.

"A sham peace - over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans - would gain nothing," Baerbock said in a statement. Treasury Department on Wednesday announced sanctions on assets of four individuals whom it linked to Mexico-based Cartel del Noreste, including the popular hip-hop artist El Makabelico.

The comment comes after U.S. President Donald Trump startled U.S. This requires tough and long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, a strong NATO and progress in Ukraine's accession negotiations with the European Union," she said.

Content: "That followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who had visited Kyiv to discuss US access to rare earth minerals, energy resources and energy assets, according to Reuters.

The US has suggested that it would seek access to [rare earth minerals](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-rare-earths-ukraine-us-trade-deal-aid-russia)
, which are strategic metals essential for industries developing computers, batteries and cutting-edge energy technology in exchange for providing military aid to Ukraine in the future.

The rapid developments have worried Europe that Putin and Trump appear to be negotiating the future of the continent’s security over the heads of the Europeans themselves.

“If Europe is responsible for Ukraine’s security and could even provide troops \[under a ceasefire agreement\], then we should have a seat at the table and be consulted with the Americans,” said one European official. Our priority right now is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position.”

Trump’s announcement followed a prisoner swap involving [Marc Fogel,](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/russia-us-prisoner-trump-marc-fogel)
 a US teacher who was arrested in Moscow on drug charges, and Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 in Greece on cryptocurrency fraud charges and then extradited to the US.

The deal was arranged by Steve Witkoff, Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, one of the president’s closest allies on the team that will lead negotiations with the Russians.

The US negotiating team would include the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of the CIA, John Ratcliffe; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and Witkoff.

Notable for his absence from the negotiating team was Gen Keith Kellogg, whom Trump had earlier named his special envoy to Ukraine and Russia and who was in the process of meeting with European leaders to discuss the upcoming negotiations.

Yet few were convinced he spoke directly for Trump, and he offered few concrete details beyond his “deep faith” that Trump was the best person to negotiate the deal, one official said.

Trump says he has spoken to Putin and agreed to negotiate Ukraine ceasefire
===========================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth says Ukraine would have to cede territory, alarming Kyiv and European allies

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 has said that he and [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
 have agreed to begin negotiations to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, later adding that it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory or join Nato if a deal is to be reached.

Trump said that he was “OK” with [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 not having Nato membership and that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would take much land back in the negotiations.

Russia “took a lot of land, and they fought for that land and they lost a lot of soldiers”, he told reporters later in the Oval Office.

Trump said he was not closely concerned with which territories were handed over.

“I’m just here to try and get peace,” he said. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations.”

[US no longer ‘primarily focused’ on Europe’s security, says Pete Hegseth\

The Kremlin confirmed the call and the mutual invitations for the leaders to visit each other’s countries in what would be the first visits by an American president to Russia since 2009 and the first by Putin to the US since 2015.

In its readout, the Kremlin also maintained a maximalist position, with Putin saying he “mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and agreed with Trump that a long-term settlement could be achieved through peaceful negotiations”.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy – at least in public – offered support for the talks on Wednesday, saying he and Trump had held a “meaningful” conversation by phone. As President Trump said, let’s get it done.”

'I don't think it's practical': Trump on Nato membership for Ukraine – video

Trump told reporters that the US would seek to “secure” future military aid against Ukrainian rare earth minerals and other natural resources.

Trump said he was not concerned about freezing out Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the talks, saying: “I don’t think so as long as he’s there.”

But, he said, “sometime \[Ukraine’s\] going to have to have elections too … His poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”

Trump said Zelenskyy would meet on Friday with the vice-president, JD Vance, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the Munich security conference.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US negotiating position was outlined in Brussels, where secretary of defence Pete Hegseth delivered public remarks that [Kyiv must acknowledge that it cannot win back all the land occupied by Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth)
.

“We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” Hegseth said, sketching out an initial position for any peace negotiations with Russia.

“Chasing this illusory goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,” he added, though this could be interpreted as in effect acknowledging the annexation of Crimea, and large parts of the Donbas, by Russia.

Kyiv would only achieve peace through “robust security guarantees”, but Hegseth ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said that Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington. “I don’t care so much about anything other than I want to stop having millions of people killed.”

The rapid entry into negotiations with Russia and open demands that Ukraine concede land will have set alarm bells ringing in Kyiv and among its European allies that the Trump administration will offer minimal resistance to Putin’s demands in order to cut a deal as quickly as possible.

In a social media post, Trump said he held a “lengthy and highly productive phone call” with Putin and that they agreed to “have our respective teams start negotiations immediately”.

He said that he and Putin had agreed to visit each other’s countries, later telling reporters that their first meeting would take place in Saudi Arabia.

“As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That includes much of eastern Europe, including Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

In December, Putin also stated that he would insist on Ukraine adopting a neutral status and implementing some degree of demilitarisation, while also demanding that the west lift its sanctions on Russia.

Kyiv has rejected those demands in the past and the Biden administration had said that it would be up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks.

Earlier this week, [Zelenskyy told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america)
 that Europe was not able to offer resilient security guarantees to Kyiv without the involvement of the US. So we must accept this and figure out what we can do.”

Another senior European diplomat called the US position outlined by Hegseth a premature surrender, asking what there would be left to negotiate. The French foreign minister, Jean Noël-Barrot, called for Europe’s direct participation in the talks, saying that there “will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans”.

A spokesperson for the British foreign office expressed support for Trump’s desire to bring the war to an end, but added: “Russia could do this tomorrow by withdrawing its forces and ending its illegal invasion."

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump said negotiations to end the Ukraine war will start “immediately” after holding a “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday morning.

The call, which is the first known conversation between the presidents since Trump assumed office last month, came as as Trump makes clear to his advisers he wants to bring the Ukraine conflict to a swift end.

Trump administration officials said they hoped [a prisoner “exchange”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/politics/marc-fogel-released-russia-trump/index.html)
 on Tuesday could portend renewed efforts to end the war, which is about to enter its fourth year.

Now, as the two leaders resume communication after a long period of silence between the White House and Kremlin, the contours of Trump’s settlement plan are coming into clearer focus.

In a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”

“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump wrote.

Both Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.

“President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, ‘COMMON SENSE.’ We both believe very strongly in it,” Trump wrote, suggesting the former KGB agent on the other end of the line had chosen his words carefully to appeal to the US leader.

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin spoke for nearly 90 minutes.

Trump had been signaling for weeks his desire to speak with Putin as he works to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

As American officials travel in Europe this week, they have begun taking clearer positions on how the conclusion of the Ukraine war might look. Speaking to a conference in Brussels, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Kyiv joining NATO is unrealistic and that the US will no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security as the Trump administration shifts its attention to securing US borders and deterring war with China.

Meanwhile, Trump has spoken of striking a deal with Ukraine’s Zelensky for American access to the country’s valuable rare earth minerals as payment for continued American assistance.

Trump spoke with Zelensky midday, shortly after getting off the phone with Putin.

His predecessor, President Joe Biden, hadn’t spoken to his Russian counterpart in nearly three years, believing there was little to be gained in speaking to a leader he’d deemed a war criminal.

The last US president to visit Russia was Barack Obama in 2013, when he attended a G20 summit. Putin last visited in the United States in 2015 to attend United Nations talks.

Later on Wednesday, Trump indicated that he could soon meet with Putin in Saudi Arabia but cautioned that no formal decision has been made on the matter.

“We think we’re going to probably meet in Saudi Arabia, the first meeting,” Trump said, hours after the two spoke by phone.

The president indicated that Saudi Arabian leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would play a role in the discussions, saying, “We know the crown prince, and I think it’d be a very good place to be.”

A date for that meeting, Trump said, “hasn’t been set,” but he said it could be in the “not too distant future.”

Trump added he has not yet committed to go to Ukraine.

Asked whether Zelensky would be in attendance when he meets with Putin, Trump appeared to suggest he would not be present for the initial meeting: “Probably we’ll have a first meeting and then we’ll see what we can do about the second meeting.”

“I would think about going, I’d think about it, no problem,” he said.

Steve Witkoff, who will be among Trump’s top negotiators on the conflict, pointed earlier Wednesday to the release of wrongfully detained American Marc Fogel as “an indication of what the possibilities are” for the future of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

“I think that’s maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future, and what that may portend for the world at large, for conflict and so forth. I think they had a great friendship, and I think now it’s going to continue, and it’s a really good thing for the world,” he said.

Witkoff met privately with Putin while in Moscow on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW/KYIV, Feb 12 (Reuters) - [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 said both Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin/)
 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace in separate phone calls with him on Wednesday, and Trump ordered top U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the [war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

The conversations came after Trump's defense secretary earlier said Kyiv would have to give up its long-held goals of joining the NATO military alliance and regaining all of its territory seized by Russia, signaling a dramatic shift in Washington's approach to the conflict.

After speaking with Putin for more than an hour, Trump said the Russian leader, who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wants the war to end and they discussed "getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future."

"He wants it to end. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, oversaw billions of dollars of military and other aid to Kyiv and had no direct contact with Putin after Russia's invasion.

Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and be rendered permanently neutral under any peace deal.

'ILLUSIONARY GOAL'
------------------

Earlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered the new administration's bluntest statement so far on its approach to the war, saying Kyiv could not realistically hope to return to [previous borders](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 or join NATO.

"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of such guarantees.

Zelenskiy, hoping to keep Trump interested in continuing to support his country, has lately proposed a deal under which the United States would invest in minerals in Ukraine.

Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in Kyiv on Wednesday on the first visit by a member of Trump's cabinet, said such a mineral deal could serve as a ["security shield"](/markets/commodities/top-trump-official-kyiv-discuss-deal-minerals-energy-2025-02-12/)
 for Ukraine after the war.

Trump also said Rubio and Vice President JD Vance will hold talks about the war on Friday in Munich, where Ukrainian officials were expected to attend an annual security conference.

The new diplomacy followed a U.S.-Russia prisoner swap that got under way on Tuesday, which the Kremlin said could help build trust between the two countries.

Russia on Tuesday freed American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence in a Russian prison, [in exchange](/world/europe/russia-says-its-getting-back-prisoner-us-return-freeing-teacher-marc-fogel-2025-02-12/)
 for a Russian cybercrime boss imprisoned in the U.S., according to a official.

Trump has long said he would quickly end the war in Ukraine, without spelling out exactly how he would accomplish this.

The Kremlin earlier said Putin and Trump had agreed to meet, and Putin had invited Trump to visit Moscow. Trump said their first meeting would "probably" take place soon in Saudi Arabia.

In a post on his social media platform, he said Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff would lead negotiations on ending the war.

Trump and Zelenskiy spoke after Trump's call with Putin, and Zelenskiy's office said the conversation lasted for about an hour.

Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.

European powers, including Britain, France and Germany, said on Wednesday they had to be [part of any future negotiations](/world/europe/germany-uk-eu-others-pledge-work-with-us-ukraines-future-2025-02-12/)

# Your Analysis

The evidence indicates that after the phone call on February 12, 2025, Trump announced the start of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Zelenskiy wanted peace, and he ordered U.S. officials to begin talks ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)).

The evidence does not state that an agreement was reached, only that negotiations would begin.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that after the phone call on February 12, 2025, Trump announced the start of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Zelenskiy wanted peace, and he ordered U.S. officials to begin talks ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)).

The evidence does not state that an agreement was reached, only that negotiations would begin.

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate. While Trump did announce action following the call, he did not announce that an agreement had been reached.

Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy expressed a desire for peace, and Trump ordered U.S. officials to begin talks ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). The Wikipedia entry on the phone call mentions that Trump shared details of his conversation with Putin and agreed to begin peace talks ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call)). The call was followed by a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:9658>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that after the phone call on February 12, 2025, Trump announced the start of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Reuters reported that Trump said both Putin and Zelenskiy wanted peace, and he ordered U.S. officials to begin talks ([https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-discussed-ending-ukraine-war-with-russias-putin-2025-02-12/)). CNN also reported on the announcement ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/putin-trump-phone-call)).

The evidence does not state that an agreement was reached, only that negotiations would begin. The Wikipedia entry mentions that Trump shared details of his conversation with Putin and agreed to begin peace talks ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call)).

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate. While Trump did announce action following the call, he did not announce that an agreement had been reached.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. After the call, Trump announced the start of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, but the evidence does not support the claim that an agreement was reached.

`false`

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Ben Stiller met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on June 20, 2022. However, the provided sources do not mention that Stiller received $4 million from USAID for the meeting.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. The information about the meeting is accurate, but the claim about the payment from USAID is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

“Perceptions of high-level corruption” could “undermine the Ukrainian public’s and foreign leader’s confidence in the war-time government,” the confidential document warned.

President Trump and his opponents jockeyed for advantage on Monday as Washington girded for a drawn-out conflict over the White House and Ukraine.

Trump and his aides sought to throw the spotlight on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who they said might be connected with what they called "corruption" in Ukraine — although Biden's camp insists [those allegations have been debunked](https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/09/23/the-story-behind-bidens-son-ukraine-and-trumps-claims/)

Trump And The Ukraine Call — What Happened And What's Next?

  ! If that ever happened — if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said — they'd be getting the electric chair by right now."

**House Democrats demand more**

Meanwhile in Washington on Monday, Democrats said they are willing to issue subpoenas to get more information about the White House's talks with the leadership of Ukraine.

House Democratic Chairmen Eliot Engel, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings said their Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees, respectively, want documents at once from Pompeo and the State Department.

"Due to the urgent and grave nature of these allegations, our committees will have no choice but to move towards compulsory process this week unless the department produces the documents we have requested," the House chairmen wrote.

**Dispute within the Senate**

Earlier in the day, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for a similar effort in the Senate.

Schumer demanded that majority Republicans convene hearings with Maguire, Pompeo and other officials, subpoena the whistleblower complaint and demand the relevant legal opinions in this case from the Justice Department.

"The Republican Senate's 'see no evil, hear no evil' attitude toward such a serious national security concern is unacceptable and must change," Schumer wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor that the Senate intelligence committee is doing its own work looking into the whistleblower matter, but he didn't say when it might hear from Maguire or whether that might take place in an open session.

The majority leader also defended what he called Republicans' record on assistance to Ukraine against Russian aggression and observed that he'd urged then-President Barack Obama to supply Kyiv with weapons, not just nonlethal assistance — which Obama declined to do but which Trump has.

**Critics see an abuse of power**

For Democrats, Trump's actions in the Ukraine matter have amounted to an abuse of his office made all the more flagrant since it ignored months of back-and-forth about foreign influence in U.S. Ours is.

**The impeachment dilemma**

What remains unclear, however, is whether the Ukraine affair might move the needle on impeachment inside Washington with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or broadly among the American people.

Although many Democrats support impeaching Trump, [most Americans have told pollsters they don't](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/08/730697885/poll-support-for-impeachment-hearings-grows-but-americans-split-on-way-forward)

The next milestone is scheduled for Thursday, when the House Intelligence Committee is scheduled to hear from acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.

One question is whether Maguire will give lawmakers a copy of a complaint filed by a whistleblower within the intelligence community about Trump's conversation with a foreign leader.

If the complaint is revealed and it pertains to Trump's talks with Ukraine — or if members of Congress learn something else that changes the dynamics of this story — the next question is what that may mean for the positions taken by Romney and others about how Congress should respond.

**Unanswered questions**

If the outlines of the story are coming into focus, however, the details are still far from clear.

Trump has acknowledged that he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy about Biden, but Trump also says his conversation was aboveboard.

And an attorney for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, says he too has been talking with Ukrainian officials. Leadership](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/762944204/trump-returns-to-the-u-n-this-week-facing-growing-unease-about-u-s-leadership)

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who also appeared on Fox News, said he hopes the government can "get to the bottom" of whether there was any "wrongdoing" by Biden in Ukraine.

Trump held up aid to Ukraine from the summer until this month, following years of U.S."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there have been allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and Ukraine. However, the evidence does not validate the specific claim that Ukraine released a list of US politicians taking bribes, nor does it confirm the amounts listed in the image.

The provided search results mention the Ukraine scandal and allegations of corruption, but they do not provide any information about a list released by Ukraine with specific amounts of bribes.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the authenticity of the list and the amounts mentioned.

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Recapture town

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

French President Emmanuel Macron Olivier Hoslet / Pool / EPA / TASS

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. <image:1440>\

### **Recapture town**

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

### **"One percent"**

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"We need more ammunition. <image:1437>\

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

The devastating Russian-Ukrainian war has been ongoing for several years, with the United States and NATO providing support to Ukraine. A report can be read [here](https://tass.com/russia/1728697)
. 

**Clarification:**

Peskov’s Comments: It is important to note that Peskov’s remarks about the United States being an “enemy” were part of a broader narrative criticizing American policies and actions towards Russia. The confusion may stem from a recent shift in Russian officials’ rhetoric amid ongoing tensions over the Ukraine conflict.

**Background:**

**Recent Statements by Russian Officials:** Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred to the United States as an “enemy” state in a recent press interaction. More details can be read [here](https://www.trtworld.com/us-and-canada/russia-formally-declares-the-us-as-enemy-what-next-18170984)
.

**Misinterpretation**: Peskov’s statement, “We are now an enemy country for them, just as they are for us,” has been misinterpreted on social media as a declaration of war. This is a significant escalation from the term “unfriendly states” that Russian officials have used previously to describe the United States and its allies.

**Context**: Peskov’s comments followed actions by the Biden administration, allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to attack targets within Russia. In this context, a significant amount of misleading information regarding the situation is being spread on social media.

**Social Media Posts** 

Social media posts claim that Russia has declared war against the USA.

! Details can be read [here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy770l9llnzo)
. 

**Historical Rhetoric:** Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously referred to the Western countries’ elites as Russia’s enemies while characterizing Ukraine as a tool used by the West. The rhetoric from Russian officials reflects escalating tensions but does not amount to a declaration of war. Social media users should be cautious about misinterpreting or amplifying such statements without verifying the facts through reliable sources.

Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022

Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.

Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.

Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.

Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.

But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.

Putin had just [recognised the rebel states as independent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60470900)
. He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's "illegitimacy" - a false narrative that has also been repeated by President Trump.

As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.

Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.

Was Nato expansion to blame for the war?
----------------------------------------

Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.

Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.

But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.

After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.

Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories "with no aggressive intentions". <image:2680>!A map showing the expansion of Nato over time <image:2687>

Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: "Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."

He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should "forget about" joining the Western alliance.

Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.

Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.

Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand "an inch to the East".

However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Gorbachev said "the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed" at the time.

How could the war end?
----------------------

The most likely route is through direct talks, although previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides made little progress on a ceasefire.

After a fifth visit to Moscow by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff on 6 August, the US president said a there was a "good chance" he could meet the Russian and Ukrainian leaders for talks in person.

The Kremlin also said a Trump-Putin meeting would happen in the coming days, but Putin ruled out an imminent meeting with Zelensky, saying the right conditions were not in place.

So far though, the two sides have been unable to find a way of bridging their differences.

Russia wants direct talks to address the "root causes of the conflict", a phrase that harks back to Putin's "maximalist" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.

These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations.

Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. <image:2680>!Reuters Vladimir Putin remembering Russia's victory over Nazi Germany wears a long coat as soldiers pass him by carrying swords <image:2689>Reuters

Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine

At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian "bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.

More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.

Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in days, overthrow its pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.

US President Donald Trump has been trying to negotiate a peace deal and the Kremlin says Putin will meet Trump "in the coming days". Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an "artificial state".

Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.

Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that "denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.

Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.

Does Putin want to get rid of Zelensky?
---------------------------------------

! <image:2680>!Getty Images The president of Ukraine holds his hands out, flanked by two Ukrainian flags <image:2685>Getty Images

Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019

Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war.

Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.

"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.

"[They want to destroy Ukraine politically](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-prezidenta-do-ukrayinciv-naprikinci-pershogo-dnya-73149)
 by destroying the head of state."

Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.

Even now, Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a "loser" and a "clown". It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.

Was Zelensky to blame for the war?
----------------------------------

Before his return to the White House and in the first months of his presidency, Trump suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.

"\[Zelensky\] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser," he said in October 2024.

In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.

However, the US president's messaging has not been altogether consistent, and in recent weeks his position appears to have hardened against Russia.

"We thought we had \[the war\] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people," he said last month.

Trump has announced sweeping new secondary tariffs on any country still trading with Russia if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, 8 August.

Do Putin's claims on Nazis and genocide stack up?

Content: "After each of them—Serbia in 2000, Georgia in 2003, Ukraine in 2004, the Arab Spring in 2011, Russia in 2011–12, and Ukraine in 2013–14—Putin has pivoted to more hostile policies toward the United States, and then invoked the NATO threat as justification for doing so.

Boris Yeltsin never supported NATO expansion but acquiesced to the first round of expansion in 1997 because he believed that his close ties to President Bill Clinton and the United States were not worth sacrificing over this comparatively smaller matter. Following John Mearsheimer’s provocative 2014 _Foreign Affairs_ article arguing that “the Ukraine crisis is the West’s fault,” the narrative of Russian backlash against NATO expansion has become a dominant framework for explaining—if not justifying—Moscow’s ongoing war against Ukraine.[1](#f1)
 This notion has been repeated not only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by politicians, analysts, and writers. By this telling, the specter of Ukraine’s NATO membership points both to the cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

### Michael McFaul

_**Michael McFaul**, former U.S. If NATO was _always_ a threat to Russia and its “sphere of influence,” why did Putin facilitate the opening of these bases in the former Soviet Union?

During his November 2001 visit to the United States, Putin struck a realistic but cooperative tone:

> We differ in the ways and means we perceive that are suitable for reaching the same objective . Putin blamed the United States directly for assisting this democratic breakthrough and helping to install someone whom he saw as a pro-American puppet, President Mikheil Saakashvili. Since the Revolution of Dignity, Putin has waged an unprecedented assault against Ukraine’s democracy using a full spectrum of military, political, informational, social, and economic weapons in an attempt to destabilize and eventually topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government.[18](#f18)
 Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the United States was just a symptom of what Putin believes is the underlying disease: a sovereign, democratic Ukraine.

Clips of Hegseth calling Vladimir Putin a "war criminal" appeared online after he was nominated as secretary of defense by President-elect Donald Trump. Think about it through the psychology of him."

The Facts

While Hegseth aligned with the claim that Putin was a "war criminal," the clip shared online was from March 2022 not long after the outbreak of the conflict.

Since then Hegseth has been more cautious, and critical of the U.S. spending on the conflict, claims appeared on social media repeating comments Hegseth had made criticizing Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 in bold terms.

!Pete Hegseth <image:2703>

Pete Hegseth on May 31, 2019, in New York City. intervention in Ukraine and the prognosis from others that Russia's intervention would lead to wider conflict.

In an episode of the _Shawn Ryan Show_ Podcast from November 2024, Hegseth said he did not see Putin taking the world into a wider global or nuclear conflict, saying his gains would be incremental, part of what he called a "get my s\*\*\* back" conflict.

"I found it overinflated from the beginning this idea that Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine was going to lead to nuclear war or war across the continent," Hegseth said.

"I've always felt like it was from the beginning, like a couple days in, I like, this feels like the Putin's 'give me my s\*\*\* back' war.

"It kind of feels like \[Putin thought\] 'I feel like you've been pushing pretty hard, and we used to have the former Soviet Union, and we're pretty proud of that, and Ukraine was a part of it, and all these other... I think he probably knows enough to know that it's probably not going much further than Ukraine.

"And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell-bent on bringing in armageddon with nuclear warfare."

Elsewhere, he has also defended Trump's comment in 2022 calling Putin "very savvy" after the Russian president announced Moscow's recognition of the independence of [two self-proclaimed republics](https://www.newsweek.com/blinken-says-swift-response-needed-russia-recognizing-new-republics-1681212)
 in eastern Ukraine.

While the White House and the [EU](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu)
 described Putin's actions as a violation of international law and a pretext for an invasion, Trump said [Putin's move was "genius" and "very savvy."](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-calls-putin-moving-troops-ukraine-peacekeeping-genius-1681557)

Hegseth defended the comments saying that Trump was trying to tease the media for obsessing over the Russian leader

"Here's the reality, Vladimir Putin lives rent-free in the minds of our media, of the American media," Hegseth said.

"No organism, no entity has done more to spread Russian propaganda and to prop up the strawman that is Vladimir Putin than our very own media."

In a [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6320895317112)
 interview in February 2023 with South Carolina [Republican](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)
 Representative [Nancy Mace](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nancy-mace)
, Hegseth criticized the number of times President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
 had visited Ukraine compared to the southern border of the U.S., and the "billions spent in Ukraine" suggesting he was ignoring "our problems at home."

He also asked "what do we get out of" the billions the U.S."

“There are good guys and bad guys in this war, and the Russians are the bad guys,” Wicker said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made a “rookie mistake” when he said a return to Ukraine’s pre-war borders was “unrealistic,” Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker said Friday.

Hegseth on Thursday [pulled back some of the comments](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/hegseth-pull-back-00204088)
 he made about Ukraine a day earlier, where he said that NATO membership for Kyiv was off the table and that the country could not return to its internationally recognized borders. 

“Hegseth is going to be a great defense secretary, although he wasn’t my choice for the job,” the Mississippi Republican [told POLITICO on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference](https://www.politico.eu/politico-munich-security-conference-2025/)
. Wicker said he favors a firm posture with Moscow.

“Everybody knows … and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to,” Wicker said, adding that he was “puzzled” and “disturbed” by Hegseth’s comments.

President Donald Trump this week held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war; Vice President JD Vance will meet in Munich Friday with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Hegseth wasn't freelancing. “But he made a rookie mistake in Brussels and he’s walked back some of what he said but not that line."

"I don’t know who wrote the speech — it is the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written, and Carlson is a fool," Wicker said, referring to the pro-Putin broadcaster.

Speaking to Jonathan Martin at the POLITICO Pub in the Munich conference, Wicker — a staunch Ukraine supporter — said he was “surprised” by Hegseth’s original comments and “heartened” that the new defense secretary had reversed course. Trump on Thursday said there was a "good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war." He also said it was not "practical" for Kyiv to join NATO and "unlikely" that Ukraine could return to its 2014 pre-invasion borders.

The direct talks between Trump and Putin have left European allies rattled that the EU and Ukraine could be sidelined in any peace deal.

Amid Trump’s talks with Putin, Wicker took a more hawkish stance that is in line with traditional Republican views. resolve, arguing that failing to arm Ukraine could force American troops into future wars.

On Friday, Wicker also called for the U.S."

The session revealed deep divisions within the GOP on U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (R) looks on as U.S. [Mitch McConnell](https://kyivindependent.com/mcconnells-exit-signals-shift-in-republican-support-for-ukraine/)
 of Kentucky, one of three Republicans who voted against Hegseth’s confirmation, who warned, "America’s reputation is on the line."

McConnell, now chair of the panel overseeing defense funding, issued some of his strongest public criticism yet, questioning whether the United States would continue defending democratic allies against authoritarian threats.

He contrasted his stance — rooted in a Reagan-era commitment to global leadership — with Hegseth’s "America First" approach favored by many Trump supporters. "We don’t want a headline at the end of this conflict that says [Russia](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/)
 wins and America loses," McConnell said.

When asked who the aggressor in the three-year-old war is, [Hegseth](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-bracing-for-painful-reduction-in-us-military-aid-after-hegseth-announces-cuts/)
 responded, "Russia is the aggressor." But he avoided directly stating which side the U.S. wants to see win, instead emphasizing that President Trump is committed to achieving peace.

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

CNN  — 

A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet crashed after Russia launched a huge aerial assault involving hundreds of drones and scores of missiles overnight, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday.

The airman, named as 1st Class Lt. Maksym Ustymenko by the Ukrainian air force, was the third F-16 pilot killed since the Ukrainians began flying the jets last summer, and his plane was the fourth F-16 Ukraine has lost since then.

The air force said Ustymenko “did everything he could to steer the aircraft away from a populated area, but he did not have time to eject.”

Ustymenko’s death is a major loss for Ukraine. But Kyiv is at risk of running out of missiles for these systems, as Trump continues to threaten withdrawing US aid from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian air force said Sunday it had downed 211 drones and 38 missiles launched by Moscow overnight. Only a small number of the country’s top pilots have been trained to fly F-16s, the most advanced of Ukraine’s fighter jets. The training is highly specialized and takes months to complete.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ustymenko destroyed seven targets before being killed, praising him and the Ukrainian air force for “heroically protecting” the country’s skies.

Zelensky said Moscow launched 477 drones and 60 missiles towards six different locations overnight into Sunday – one of Russia’s largest ever aerial assaults in terms of weapons deployed, according to a CNN tally.

Deadly aerial attacks
---------------------

Russia has ramped up its [airborne attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd)
 against Ukraine in recent weeks, launching hundreds of drones and missiles nearly every night.

These assaults are not just bigger and more frequent; they are also more concentrated and executed in a way that makes them a lot more difficult to combat – as they are flown at higher altitudes, out of reach of machine guns.

Zelensky said on Sunday that more than 114 missiles, over 1,270 drones, and nearly 1,100 glide bombs were launched by Russia against Ukraine just this week.

The Ukrainian leader pleaded with Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more aerial defenses for his country, saying Russia will continue to attack Ukraine for as long as it can.

“This war must be brought to an end — pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection. Protection from ballistic and other missiles, from drones, and from terror,” Zelensky said.

He added that Ukraine was ready to buy “American systems” to strengthen its air defenses – a clear call to US President Donald Trump and his administration to allow Ukraine to purchase the Patriot air defense systems.

The Patriots are widely considered to be among the best air defense systems. While there are other systems manufactured by some of Ukraine’s other allies, none can match the Patriots when it comes to protection against advanced hypersonic and ballistic missiles.

Ukraine is known to have roughly half a dozen of the [US-made Patriot air defense systems](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/world/trump-cut-ukrainian-aid-patriot-missiles-intl)
, although the exact numbers and their locations are closely guarded secrets.

The Patriots play a crucial role in Ukraine’s air defense, protecting millions of civilians from Russian missiles. Russian strikes were recorded in six locations with debris reported across eight locations, it added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the strikes targeted Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex facilities and oil refineries,” but the Ukrainians said civilian infrastructure objects were hit.

At least 11 people were injured, including two children, in a Russian attack in the city of Smila, in the central region of Cherkasy, local officials said in an update on Sunday.

Three nine-story buildings, private houses, and cars were significantly damaged in the shelling, as well as four educational institutions and a psychiatric hospital, Ihor Taburets, head of Cherkasy regional military administration, said.

Landmines question
------------------

Also on Sunday, Zelensky announced he signed a decree that would take Ukraine out of the Ottawa Treaty, the international agreement that bans the use of anti-personnel landmines.

A long-signalled move by Ukraine, the withdrawal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. We cannot remain bound by conditions when the enemy has no restrictions,” Roman Kostenko, a member of the Ukrainian Parliament, said in a statement.

According to the United Nations, Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world. The US under the Biden Administration approved shipments of landmines to Ukraine last November.

Large swathes of Ukrainian land, especially along the frontlines in the east and in areas that were once occupied by Russia, are off limits to civilians because of the mines."

LONDON -- Russia launched 537 drones and missiles into Ukraine overnight into Sunday morning, according to Ukraine's air force, with a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet and its pilot also reported lost during efforts to repel the attack.

Ukraine's air force wrote on Telegram that Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles at targets across the country overnight. <image:9769>

Zelenskyy also said he had ordered an investigation into Ustimenko's death, adding "Ukrainian aviation heroically defends the sky. "The work of Ukrainian fighters is extremely dangerous," it said.

Among the pilots was Lt. Saturday night's attack was one of -- if not the -- largest of Moscow's war to date.

In Poland -- which borders Ukraine to its west -- the Armed Forces Operational Command said in a post to X that the Russian strikes prompted Polish and allied aircraft to be scrambled.

The command said it "activated all available forces and resources at his disposal, the duty fighter pairs have been scrambled and the ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached the highest state of readiness. Ustimenko, it added, guided the plane away from residential areas on the ground but "did not have time to eject."

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, June 29 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian F-16 fighter pilot died in a crash while repelling a Russian air attack that involved hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, authorities said on Sunday, as Moscow intensifies night-time air barrages in the [fourth year of war](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/)
.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the pilot, Maksym Ustymenko, and bestowed upon him posthumously the title of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest decoration.

He also called for more support from Washington and Western allies to bolster Ukraine's air defences after the attack, which damaged homes and infrastructure across the country and injured at least 12 people, according to local authorities.

In Kyiv, families huddled in metro stations for shelter after air raid sirens rung out. Kyiv has not revealed the size of its F-16 fleet, but they have become a central and heavily used part of Ukraine's defences.

The pilot flew the damaged jet away from a settlement but had no time to eject before it crashed, the Ukrainian Air Force said.

"The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude," the Air Force said on Telegram.

Ukrainian military expert Roman Svitan, speaking earlier this month, said the F-16 was not ideally suited to all tasks in the war, particularly repelling drones which swarm Ukrainian cities, as it is better used against higher-speed targets.

Zelenskiy, speaking in his nightly video address, said Ustymenko had been flying missions since the time of a campaign that began in 2014 against Russian-financed separatists who had seized parts of eastern Ukraine.

"He mastered four types of aircraft and had important results to his name in defending Ukraine," he said. Machine-gun fire and explosions were heard across the capital and in the western city of Lviv, where such attacks are less common.

The governor of the Lviv region, bordering Poland, said the raid targeted critical infrastructure.

Ukraine has now [lost](/world/europe/ukraine-pilot-killed-f-16-fighter-jet-lost-ukrainian-military-says-2025-06-29/)
 three F-16s since it began operating the U.S.-made jets last year. "It is painful to lose such people."

The Ukrainian military said in total Russia launched 477 drones and 60 missiles of various types to Ukraine overnight. Ukrainian forces destroyed 211 of the drones and 38 missiles, it said, while 225 more drones were either lost due to electronic warfare or were decoys that carried no explosives.

Writing earlier on X, Zelenskiy said: "Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes." He said Russia had launched around 114 missiles, 1,270 drones, and 1,100 glide bombs just in the past week.

Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency said one person was killed by a Ukrainian drone in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's Luhansk region. Both Ukraine and Russia say they do not attack civilian targets.

POLITICAL WILL
--------------

Ukraine says recent attacks highlight the need for further support from Washington, which under President Donald Trump has not committed to new military aid for Ukraine.

Trump said he was considering a Ukrainian request [for more Patriot missile, opens new tab](europe)
 batteries after he met Zelenskiy at a NATO summit last Wednesday.

"This war must be brought to an end - pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection," Zelenskiy said in his X post. "Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence - the thing that best protects lives."

He said Ukraine was ready to buy the American air defence systems and it counts on "leadership, political will, and the support of the United States, Europe, and all our partners."

Russia has launched large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities every few days in recent weeks, causing widespread damage, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more.

During the latest barrage, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors said. The Ukrainian military said air strikes were recorded in six locations.

Eleven people, including two children, were injured in the central Cherkasy region, the regional governor said on Telegram."

**Armed Forces Day**, known also as the **Feast of the Polish Armed Forces** ([Polish](/wiki/Polish_language "Polish language")
: _Święto Wojska Polskiego_), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over [Soviet Russia](/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic")
 at the [Battle of Warsaw](/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920) "Battle of Warsaw (1920)")
 during the [Polish–Soviet War](/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Soviet_War "Polish–Soviet War")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2013-1)
 Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the [Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary](/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary "Assumption of Mary")
, itself a separate public holiday.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 The event is marked by [military parades](/wiki/Military_parade "Military parade")
, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the [Polish Armed Forces](/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces "Polish Armed Forces")
 across the country. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs [Stanisław Szeptycki](/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szeptycki "Stanisław Szeptycki")
 established the Feast of the Soldier (_Święta Żołnierza_), or Soldiers Day, in 1923.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, "\[o\]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence."[\[5\]](#cite_note-Museum-5)
 The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the [21st Mountain Division's](/wiki/21st_Mountain_Infantry_Division_(Poland) "21st Mountain Infantry Division (Poland)")
 evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)
 Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Kontakt24-2)

The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the [People's Republic of Poland](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Poland "People's Republic of Poland")
 discontinued the tradition.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Gazeta2013-6)
 In 1950, the [Council of Ministers](/wiki/Cabinet_of_Poland "Cabinet of Poland")
 under Prime Minister [Józef Cyrankiewicz](/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Cyrankiewicz "Józef Cyrankiewicz")
 passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (_Dzień Wojska Polskiego_), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet-organized [Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division](/wiki/Polish_1st_Tadeusz_Ko%C5%9Bciuszko_Infantry_Division "Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division")
 engaging [German](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 units at the [Battle of Lenino](/wiki/Battle_of_Lenino "Battle of Lenino")
 in October 1943.[\[7\]](#cite_note-DzU1950-7)
 The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
's defeat.[\[8\]](#cite_note-PolskieRadio2012-8)
 Following the return of democracy in the wake of the [events of 1989](/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1989")
, the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration.[\[9\]](#cite_note-Sejm1992-9)

This year’s parade on August 15 will be an expression of "strength, agency and unity" in the face of "threats from the East," Defence Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said.

Speaking during a rehearsal ahead of the Armed Forces Day parade in Warsaw, Kosiniak-Kamysz encouraged the public to celebrate the anniversary of Poland's "great victory" over the Russian Bolsheviks at the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

"Our presence will be an expression of gratitude to past generations and hope for future ones," he said.

"It will also show our strength, agency and unity in the face of threats from the East," he added.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press reported on a Polish military parade in Warsaw on August 15, 2024, for Armed Forces Day, which included over 2,500 troops and military vehicles. The parade was also mentioned in an article by Polish Radio on August 12, 2024, which stated that the parade would take place on August 15 and showcase military hardware, including South Korean-made K2 battle tanks and US-made M1A1 Abrams tanks. The parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East. <image:25>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that a military parade did take place in Poland on August 15, 2024, not August 14, as stated in the claim. The parade was held for Armed Forces Day and included military vehicles. The evidence also suggests that the parade was a display of strength, possibly in response to external threats.

The claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence. While the parade was described as an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East, this does not explicitly mean it was preparing for war.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim's veracity.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

Some open-source estimates suggest that Ukraine had already lost nearly 40 Leopards, but those estimates are unconfirmed so far, according to the report. Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, [we need your help](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/contribute?utm_source=contribute&utm_medium=article "we need your help")

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Volodymyr said it was possible to travel on that road relatively safely a month ago. On 13 March, Russia said the situation in Kursk was "fully under our control" and that Ukraine had "abandoned" much of its material.

In social media posts on 11-12 March, a fourth soldier, "Dmytro" likened the retreat from the front to "a scene from a horror movie".

What now for Ukraine's offensive?
---------------------------------

Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrskyi, insists that Ukrainian forces have pulled back to "more favourable positions", remain in Kursk, and would do so "for as long as it is expedient and necessary".

He said Russia had suffered more than 50,000 losses during the operation - including those killed, injured or captured.

However, the situation now is very different to last August. <image:9796>!Getty Images A Ukrainian soldier comforts a comrade during fighting in Kursk <image:9797>Getty Images

Ukrainian soldiers fighting in Russia's Kursk region have described scenes "like a horror movie" as they retreated from the front lines.

The BBC has received extensive accounts from Ukrainian troops, who recount a "catastrophic" withdrawal in the face of heavy fire, and columns of military equipment destroyed and constant attacks from swarms of Russian drones.

The soldiers, who spoke over social media, were given aliases to protect their identity. But this again came as a surprise to our command."

At the time of writing, just before Russia retook Sudzha, Volodymyr said Ukrainian forces were being pressed from three sides.

Maksym: Vehicle wrecks litter the roads
---------------------------------------

By 11 March, Ukrainian forces were battling to prevent the road being cut, according to Telegram messages from "Maksym".

"A few days ago, we received an order to leave the defence lines in an organised retreat," he said, adding that Russia had amassed a significant force to retake the town, "including large numbers of North Korean soldiers".

Military experts estimate Russia had amassed a force of up to 70,000 troops to retake Kursk – including about 12,000 North Koreans.

Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to "take fire control of the main logistics routes".

They included drones linked to operators by fibre-optic wires - which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.

Maksym said as a result "the enemy managed to destroy dozens of units of equipment", and that wrecks had "created congestion on supply routes".

! They were some of their best-trained soldiers, equipped with Western-supplied weapons including tanks and armoured vehicles.

Russian bloggers published videos showing some of that equipment being destroyed or captured. Military analysts estimate two-thirds of the 1,000 sq km gained at the outset have since been lost.

Any hopes that Ukraine would be able to trade Kursk territory for some of its own have significantly diminished.

Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed the Kursk operation had "accomplished its task" by forcing Russia to pull troops from the east and relieve pressure on Pokrovsk.

But it is not yet clear at what cost.

One-way attack drones and other Ukrainian weapons have destroyed thousands of Russian tanks in the past year as well as thousands of other platforms, according to the commander of U.S. Thousands of tanks destroyed on both sides,” Cavoli said.

At the start of the full-scale war in February 2022, Russia had about 13,000 tanks on active status and in storage, according to Cavoli.

“They’re starting to approach near the end of … the useful tanks in storage. So, depending on how much more they lose, that will really determine how quickly they can regenerate,” he told lawmakers.

“Russian ground forces in Ukraine have lost an estimated 3,000 tanks, 9,000 armored vehicles, 13,000 artillery systems, and over 400 air defense systems in the past year,” Cavoli said in a written statement to the committee.

However, Moscow is on pace to replace those losses, he added, noting that it has expanded its industrial production, opened new manufacturing facilities, and converted commercial production lines for military purposes.

“As a result, the Russian defense industrial base is expected to roll out 1,500 tanks, 3,000 armored vehicles, and 200 Iskander ballistic and cruise missiles this year. (Comparatively, the United States only produces about 135 tanks per year and no longer produces new Bradley Fighting Vehicles.) Additionally, we anticipate Russia to produce 250,000 artillery shells per month, which puts it on track to build a stockpile three times greater than the United States and Europe combined,” Cavoli wrote.

Cavoli did not provide comparative figures for Ukraine’s equipment losses and weapons production.

Moscow’s production capability for some items, such as artillery shells and cruise missiles, has expanded “tremendously,” and it’s building one-way attack drones “in prodigious numbers,” he told senators, noting that Russian ground forces are integrating reconnaissance and kamikaze drones into their offensive operations on the battlefield.

Ukraine has used a variety of weapons — including unmanned aerial systems, artillery and Javelin missiles, among others — to destroy Russian tanks and other equipment.

Cavoli noted that both sides in the conflict are also conducting long-range attacks, with the Russians deploying cruise missiles and glide bombs and the Ukrainians relying mainly on one-way attack drones.

Ukraine is also using “some indigenously produced cruise missile systems — one in particular that I’ve got in mind that we can talk about in closed session,” Cavoli told SASC members.

The U.S. has [provided large quantities](https://defensescoop.com/2025/01/14/ukraine-drones-uas-biden-administration-security-assistance-final-rundown/)
 of UAS — including kamikaze drones such as Switchblades and the Phoenix Ghost family of systems — to Kyiv since the war began to help it counter Russia’s invasion.

However, Ukraine’s defense industry has ramped up and is producing many of its own munitions.

“I would say they’re the world leaders in one-attack drone technology,” Cavoli told lawmakers.

President Donald Trump, noting the heavy losses on both sides of the conflict, has been pressuring Ukraine to reach a peace deal with Russia.

Meanwhile, the U.S. 10, 2024. 5, 2024."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks <image:2767>, <image:2768>, <image:2769>, and <image:2776>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The **Battle of Kursk**, also called the **Battle of the Kursk Salient**, was a major [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 [Eastern Front](/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II) "Eastern Front (World War II)")
 battle between the forces of [Nazi Germany](/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany")
 and the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")
 near [Kursk](/wiki/Kursk "Kursk")
 in southwestern Russia during the summer of 1943, resulting in a Soviet victory. Because the [Allied invasion of Sicily](/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Sicily "Allied invasion of Sicily")
 began during the battle, [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler")
 was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threat in the Mediterranean, rather than using them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front.[\[63\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDunn1997191-73)
 As a result, Hitler cancelled the offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy.[\[64\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtkinson2007172-74)
 Germany's heavy losses of men and tanks ensured that the victorious Soviet [Red Army](/wiki/Red_Army "Red Army")
 held a strategic initiative for the rest of the war. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he focused more and more on the expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the [Panther tank](/wiki/Panther_tank "Panther tank")
, but also the [Ferdinand](/wiki/Elefant "Elefant")
 [tank destroyer](/wiki/Tank_destroyer "Tank destroyer")
 and greater numbers of the [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger_I "Tiger I")
 heavy tank.[\[57\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewton200212-67)
 He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival.[\[113\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012193-124)
 Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.

With pessimism for Citadel increasing with each delay, in June, [Alfred Jodl](/wiki/Alfred_Jodl "Alfred Jodl")
, the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed the armed forces propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive.[\[122\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200455-135)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantz2013183-129)
[\[123\]](#cite_note-136)
 Due to concerns of an Allied landing in the south of France or in Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks, Hitler postponed again, this time to 20 June.[\[n\]](#cite_note-Microfilm-137)
 Zeitzler was profoundly concerned with the delays,[\[124\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHealy201083-138)
 but he still supported the offensive.[\[114\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse20041–3-125)
[\[91\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012186-101)
 On 17–18 June, following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive, Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July,[\[122\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200455-135)
 then, on 1 July, Hitler announced 5 July as the launch date of the offensive.[\[125\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETaylorKulish1974170-139)

A three-month quiet period had descended upon the Eastern Front as the Soviets prepared their defences and the Germans attempted to build up their forces. However, the force was markedly deficient in infantry divisions, which were essential to hold ground and to secure the flanks.[\[129\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewton200225-143)
 By the time the Germans initiated the offensive, their force amounted to around 777,000 men, 2,451 tanks and [assault guns](/wiki/Assault_gun "Assault gun")

In 1943, an offensive by the Soviet Central, Bryansk and Western Fronts against Army Group Centre was abandoned shortly after it began in early March, when the southern flank of the Central Front was threatened by Army Group South.[\[69\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKasdorf20007-79)

 in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland")
. The Soviets verified the intelligence via their spy in Britain, [John Cairncross](/wiki/John_Cairncross "John Cairncross")

 Cairncross also provided Soviet intelligence with identifications of the [Luftwaffe](/wiki/Luftwaffe "Luftwaffe")
 airfields in the region.[\[133\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeevor2012471-148)
 Soviet politician [Anastas Mikoyan](/wiki/Anastas_Mikoyan "Anastas Mikoyan")
 wrote that on 27 March 1943, Soviet leader [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")
 notified him of a possible German attack in the Kursk sector.[\[134\]](#cite_note-149)
 Stalin and some senior officers were eager to strike first once the _rasputitsa_ ended,[\[135\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlantzHouse200428–29mentions_[[Nikolai_Vatutin]]_and_[[Mikhail_Malinin]]-150)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClark2012189mentions_Stalin-151)
 but a number of key officers, including Deputy Supreme Commander [Georgiy Zhukov](/wiki/Georgiy_Zhukov "Georgiy Zhukov")
, recommended a strategic defensive before going on the offensive. In a letter to the _[Stavka](/wiki/Stavka "Stavka")
_ and Stalin, on 8 April, Zhukov wrote:

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks <image:2767>, <image:2768>, <image:2769>, and <image:2776>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

British Army 'funny' bridge tanks in World War II.

Imperial War Museum photo

What’s old is new again as Russia’s wider war on Ukraine grinds toward its fourth year. Sinking into the muddy riverbeds, the vehicles’ improvised surfaces function as bridges.

Kriegsforscher, a Ukrainian drone operator who has been supporting the 20,000 Ukrainian troops who carved a 250-square-mile salient out of Kursk back in August, [spotted](https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879934656864526653 "https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879934656864526653")
 one of the BTR-D bridge funnies. Open-source analysts who scour social media for evidence of damaged and destroyed armored vehicles [have identified](https://x.com/moklasen/status/1879939787265646825 "https://x.com/moklasen/status/1879939787265646825")
 at least one more.

A Russian BTR-D bridging vehicle.

Via Kriegsforscher

The funnies seem to be most active on the western edge of the Kursk salient, where Russian paratroopers have been counterattacking since November. The Ukrainians relentlessly bombard civilian bridges and any conventional or pontoon spans Russian engineers build in Kursk—and also target the Russians’ [purpose-built bridging vehicles](https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879940575618826420 "https://x.com/OSINTua/status/1879940575618826420")
, which are big and unwieldy.

Hence the pivot to the BTR-D funnies."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:26>)
web_search("Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast August 2024 tanks destroyed")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image in multiple sources. One source, from Sputnik Africa, published on October 17, 2024, reports that Ukraine has lost around 40 Leopard tanks since February 2022. The Moscow Times published an article on June 13, 2023, stating that Russia had captured German Leopard tanks in the Zaporizhzhia region. Defence Security Asia, published on May 19, 2024, discusses the destruction of Leopard tanks in Ukraine. None of the sources mention Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.

The sources include images of Leopard tanks <image:2767>, <image:2768>, <image:2769>, and <image:2776>.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kursk_campaign)) discusses the 2024 Kursk offensive, which began on August 6, 2024, as part of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The article mentions the involvement of Ukrainian forces entering Russia's Kursk Oblast, leading to clashes, the involvement of Ukrainian brigades, the capture of territory, and casualties on both sides. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q198zyppqo)) discusses the retreat of Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region and mentions destroyed military equipment. The article includes a map showing the Ukrainian advance in August 2024 and the Russian control in March 2025. <image:26>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukrainian forces entered Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, leading to clashes and the destruction of military equipment. The BBC article mentions destroyed military equipment, which aligns with the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts destroyed Ukrainian tanks. Further visual verification is needed to confirm the type of tanks in the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.
