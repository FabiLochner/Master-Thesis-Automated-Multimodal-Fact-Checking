The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a rehearsal for Poland's annual Armed Forces Day parade, which took place on August 15, 2024, as reported by the Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and Polish Radio ([Source](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)). The parade is a celebration and display of military strength, not a preparation for war.
