Content: The search result from Myth Detector, published on April 8, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin. <image:9642>. The article states that the magazine did not release an issue on March 20, 2025, the date on the fake cover, and that the issue number (1705) matches the one published on March 26. The article also mentions that the fake cover was shared on social media and that similar forgeries have been used in Russian disinformation campaigns.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.africanews.com/2025/05/06/fake-charlie-hebdo-cover-shows-zelenskyy-exploiting-popes-death-for-cash//): 
Content: The Africanews website published an article on May 6, 2025, about a fake Charlie Hebdo cover that mocks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis. <image:9648> The article states that the image is not authentic and provides evidence, including the correct edition number and a link to the real Charlie Hebdo website. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo has previously warned about pro-Russian actors creating fake covers.

The claim '<image:14> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic Charlie Hebdo magazine cover from March 20, 2025 illustrating Ukrainian President Volodoymr Zelenskyy lying in a coffin and saying 'Ukraine is an independet state' in French.' is false.
Justification: The Charlie Hebdo cover depicting Zelenskyy in a coffin is a fabrication, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [without-lie.info](https://without-lie.info/en/fake-with-another-fictional-cover-of-charlie-hebdo-magazine-with-a-caricature-of-the-president-of-ukraine/) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/). The cover's date and issue number are incorrect, and it was used in disinformation campaigns.

So, the overall veracity is: false
