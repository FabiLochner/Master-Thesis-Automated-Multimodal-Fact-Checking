Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/russia-says-ukraine-not-interested-in-long-term-peace): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, stating that Russia said Ukraine was "not interested" in a long-term peace deal. The article mentions that Trump is trying to end the war through talks with Zelenskyy and Putin. <image:0>.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: Based on the evidence, including articles from The Guardian, CNN, and Al Jazeera, peace talks between Ukraine and Russia were ongoing in 2025, with discussions involving figures like Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin. However, the available information does not confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. In fact, an Al Jazeera article from August 2025 suggests that negotiations were still in progress, and Russia claimed Ukraine was not interested in a long-term peace deal.

So, the overall veracity is: false
