Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered)) reported that Ukrainian authorities detained officials over a large-scale corruption scheme in the defense sector involving inflated prices and kickbacks. Politico ([https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)) also reported on a corruption scheme involving the procurement of military equipment at inflated prices.

PBS Frontline World ([https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html](https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/sierraleone/context.html)) discusses illicit weapons, high-level corruption, and organized crime centered in Ukraine, highlighting the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing US aid to Ukraine, which totaled 114.64 billion euros ($134bn) between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid (![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg)). The article also mentions that Ukraine has received various weapons systems from its allies. The forumarmstrade.org provides a timeline of military aid to Ukraine from 2021 to 2025, detailing aid packages from various countries, including the United States, with artillery shells, ammunition, air defense systems, drones, and other equipment.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy provides a "Ukraine Support Tracker" database quantifying military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022, with the latest update from August 12, 2025, covering data up to June 2025 (<image:k>). The tracker includes information from official government sources and news media reports. The database also mentions that Europe is now leading the US in terms of total volume of military aid provided.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine has received substantial military aid from the United States and other allies. There are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices and kickbacks, as well as the loss of military assets due to theft and lack of oversight. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the percentage of armaments being sold.

To verify the claim, information is missing regarding the volume of arms sales by Ukraine and the origin of those arms.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported that Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in 2020–24, with imports increasing nearly 100 times compared to 2015–19. The main suppliers to Ukraine were the USA (45%), Germany (12%), and Poland (11%) ([https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2025/ukraine-worlds-biggest-arms-importer-united-states-dominance-global-arms-exports-grows-russian)). The Associated Press reported on an $825 million arms sale to Ukraine approved by the Trump administration ([https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207)). The Washington Post discussed the dominance of the global arms industry, with U.S. arms exports increasing by more than a fifth between 2020 and 2024 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/09/us-arms-sales-ukraine-israel/)). None of the sources mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime published a report on June 18, 2024, discussing future trends in arms trafficking from the Ukraine conflict, highlighting concerns about the diversion of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and ammunition from Ukraine, and the establishment of more organized arms trafficking markets, routes, and supply chains (![image 1112](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505188-439338.jpg)). The EU Advisory Mission Ukraine (EUAM) reported on February 6, 2025, that the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine launched a Coordination Centre to Combat Illicit Arms Trafficking (![image 1115](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505191-086355.jpg), ![image 1117](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505191-966165.jpg), ![image 1118](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505192-269011.jpg), ![image 1120](media/2025-08-06_18-33-1754505192-805061.jpg)). The UN Office on Drugs and Crime stated that no weapons were trafficked to the European Union due to the efforts of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has become a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier. There are also concerns about arms trafficking and diversion of weapons from Ukraine. However, the evidence does not provide any data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information regarding the percentage of arms sales.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Statista, in cooperation with SIPRI, published a report in March 2025, detailing arms exports from Ukraine by country from 2018 to 2024, with China, Saudi Arabia, and India as main importers. ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294319/ukraine-arms-exports-by-country/)) ![image 13121](media/2025-08-31_18-15-1756664127-856162.jpg) ![image 13122](media/2025-08-31_18-15-1756664128-303260.jpg) ![image 13123](media/2025-08-31_18-15-1756664128-659998.jpg) Trading Economics reports that Ukraine's weapons sales decreased to 23 SIPRI TIV Million in 2024, with an average of 388.15 SIPRI TIV Million from 1992 to 2024. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/weapons-sales))

The report does not mention the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ukraine exports arms, with China, Saudi Arabia, and India being major importers. However, the evidence does not provide the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine, nor does it specify the origin of the arms being sold. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The investigation revealed that while Ukraine receives significant military aid and has faced corruption issues, there is no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. The search results provided information on arms imports and exports, but not the specific percentage of arms sales.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The available evidence does not support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While Ukraine is a major importer of arms, with the U.S. being a primary supplier, and there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking, there is no data on the percentage of arms sales by Ukraine, nor does it specify the origin of the arms being sold. Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated.
