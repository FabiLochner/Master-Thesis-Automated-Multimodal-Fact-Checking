## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On December 9, 2024, The Kyiv Independent reported that Zelenskyy planned to discuss Ukraine's NATO invitation with Biden, quoting Zelenskyy as saying, "By the way, I am going to call President Biden in the near future to raise the issue of Ukraine’s NATO invitation.” ([https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-discuss-nato-invitation-with-biden-president-said/](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-discuss-nato-invitation-with-biden-president-said/)) New Voice Ukraine reported that Zelenskyy announced plans to discuss Ukraine's invitation to NATO with Biden and stated he could not yet address the issue with Trump because he "doesn't have all the legal powers." ([https://english.nv.ua/nation/zelenskyy-plans-nato-talks-with-biden-acknowledges-trump-s-current-limits-50472802.html](https://english.nv.ua/nation/zelenskyy-plans-nato-talks-with-biden-acknowledges-trump-s-current-limits-50472802.html))

Breaking Defense reported on a speech by Zelenskyy at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, where he stated he had good meetings with Trump when he was president. ([https://breakingdefense.com/2024/07/zelenskyy-implores-us-to-continue-aid-for-ukraine-amid-election-uncertainty/](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/07/zelenskyy-implores-us-to-continue-aid-for-ukraine-amid-election-uncertainty/)) The article includes a photo of Zelenskyy and Biden. <image:0>


## Elaboration
1.  The Kyiv Independent reported that Zelenskyy said he would raise the issue of Ukraine's NATO invitation with Biden.
2.  New Voice Ukraine reported that Zelenskyy planned to discuss Ukraine's NATO invitation with Biden and stated he could not yet address the issue with Trump because Trump "doesn't have all the legal powers."
3.  Breaking Defense reported that Zelenskyy had good meetings with Trump when he was president.

The evidence suggests that Zelenskyy intended to discuss NATO with Biden. While the evidence provides a quote about discussing NATO with Biden, it does not fully support the claim's second part, which states, "there's no point in talking to Trump." The New Voice Ukraine article provides a similar sentiment, but it is not a direct quote.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Zelenskyy did plan to discuss NATO with Biden. While there's evidence of Zelenskyy's interactions with both Biden and Trump, the exact quote provided in the claim is not fully supported. The evidence shows Zelenskyy stating he would discuss NATO with Biden and that he couldn't address the issue with Trump because he "doesn't have all the legal powers." Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not entirely accurate. While Zelenskyy did plan to discuss NATO with Biden, as reported by [The Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/zelensky-plans-to-discuss-nato-invitation-with-biden-president-said/) and [New Voice Ukraine](https://english.nv.ua/nation/zelenskyy-plans-nato-talks-with-biden-acknowledges-trump-s-current-limits-50472802.html), the specific quote attributed to him is not fully supported by the available evidence. The evidence suggests a similar sentiment, but not the exact quote.
