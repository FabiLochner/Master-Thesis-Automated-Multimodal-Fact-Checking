## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/) states that the claim is false, citing a Facebook post with an image of Netanyahu and Trump as the source of the misinformation. The article was published on August 7, 2025, and includes a quote from Netanyahu discussing resettlement options, including Somalia, Morocco, and Sudan. ![image 2170](media/2025-08-07_20-04-1754597094-615062.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly states that the claim is false, citing a Facebook post as the source of the misinformation. The article mentions that Netanyahu discussed resettlement options, but not to Ukraine and Syria.

The Soufan Center published an Intelbrief on April 9, 2025, discussing Netanyahu's White House visit and related discussions about Syria and the military campaign in Gaza. However, the evidence does not mention any resettlement plans.

The Jerusalem Post published an article on August 2, 2025, about a bilateral dinner between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on July 7, 2025. This does not support the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The provided evidence from StopFake.org directly refutes the claim, stating it is misinformation. While there are mentions of Netanyahu's White House visit and discussions about related topics, there is no evidence to support the claim that he announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), the claim originated from a Facebook post and is misinformation. While there were discussions about related topics during Netanyahu's White House visit, there is no evidence to support the claim.
