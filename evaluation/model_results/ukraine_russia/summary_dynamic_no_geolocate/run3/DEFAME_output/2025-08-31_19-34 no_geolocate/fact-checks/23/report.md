## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 and a temporary freeze on military aid by President Trump in early March 2025. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) reported around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) reported on February 11, 2025, that the Trump administration announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million, in addition to $310 million approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided significant military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the claim of $350 billion in military aid as of February 2025. NPR reports around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. CSIS reports on weapons sales totaling $652 million in February 2025. The evidence also mentions a $20 billion loan in late 2024 and a planned $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The provided sources do not mention the amount of $350 billion.

To verify the claim, I would need more specific data on the total military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that the U.S. has provided military aid to Ukraine, but the amount mentioned in the claim ($350 billion) is not supported by the provided sources. The sources mention different amounts, such as $75 billion since 2022 and $652 million in weapons sales in February 2025.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided significant aid, sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war) report around $75 billion in military assistance since 2022, and [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine) reports on weapons sales totaling $652 million in February 2025.
