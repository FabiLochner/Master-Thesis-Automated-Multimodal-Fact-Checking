Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News fact-checks the claim that Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine, rating it as "False". <image:511> Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, donated more than $800 million to Ukraine since 2022 through his own foundation. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation's total grantmaking in support of mitigating the war's impact on Ukraine will exceed $1 billion by the end of 2025. The foundation spent $510,986,831 in Ukraine since the start of the war, according to its 2023 report.

The claim 'Warren Buffett has given more than $500 million to Ukraine since 2022.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine, the evidence indicates that Warren Buffett himself has not made such a donation. A fact-check from Yahoo News explicitly labels the claim as "False" ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-warren-buffett-did-130000882.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
