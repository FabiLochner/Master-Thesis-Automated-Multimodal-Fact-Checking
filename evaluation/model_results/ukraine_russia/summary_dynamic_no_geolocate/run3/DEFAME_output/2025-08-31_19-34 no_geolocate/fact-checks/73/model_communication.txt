An F-16 Fighting Falcon rests inside a warehouse near March Air Reserve Base after crashing on May 16, 2019. The missiles on board did not explode. The plane suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure, rendering the pilot unable to control the jet, the U.S. Air Force said April 23, 2020. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

The U.S. Air Force has answered a questioned that burned in people’s minds as bystanders were hurriedly pushed back to safer locations several times and the 215 Freeway was closed after [the crash of an Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 near March Air Reserve Base in 2019:

Why didn’t the missiles aboard the Flying Falcon explode on impact?

The reason, the Air Force said this week, is that the ordnance attached to the F-16 during its intercept training mission were never armed.

“Aircraft flying this mission do fly with live ordnance. In order for the weapons to detonate, there are multiple conditions that must be met, including arming and launching of the weapon to complete the detonation sequences,” said Capt. Tisha J. Yates, an Air Force spokeswoman at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia.

The missiles were eventually removed from the jet as it sat in a warehouse on Opportunity Way near the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. They were trucked to nearby Ben Clark Training Center, [where they were destroyed in a controlled detonation](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2019/05/17/x-9/)
.

“The determination to move civilians away from the scene was a safety measure put in place by the incident commander on scene and in coordination with NORAD based on the hazards present until all munitions were secured,” Yates said in response to questions from this news organization, [which first reported the cause of the crash](https://www.pressenterprise.com/2020/04/23/hydraulic-failure-caused-f-16-to-crash-near-march-base-last-year-air-force-says/)
.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota. The pilot was attached to the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

On May 16, 2019, the pilot was returning from the two-jet maneuvers about 120 miles east of March when he lost hydraulic pressure and therefore the ability to control the aircraft. At 3:39 p.m., after burning off fuel, he ejected about 250 feet off the ground less than a mile from the base. The pilot suffered minor injuries, as did about a dozen people in the warehouse where the plane crashed.

The Air Force concluded in its 22-page accident report that the $24 million jet lost the fluid from its two hydraulic tanks when two inlet check valves — each less than an inch tall — failed because they were improperly installed.

Each valve consists of a cap, screw threads, a retainer ring and an O-ring that collectively are referred to as a screw cap. That screw cap screws into the valve body. The retainer helps keep the O-ring in place. It is primarily the screw cap retainer and O-ring that prevent hydraulic fluid from leaking under high pressure.

The investigation determined that both screw caps were not properly screwed into the valve bodies. The retainers were found to be deformed, and portions of the O-rings were missing. As a result, hydraulic fluid leaked out through the threads between the screw caps and the valve bodies.

A suspected hydraulic leak had been noted in the jet in March 2019. A new flight-control system that had been overhauled months earlier was installed on March 28, and the plane flew 10 more missions without incident before the crash. The report concluded that the overhaul process lacked “an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves.” ISA stands for Integrated Servo Actuator, a flight-control system.

In the wake of the crash, the Air Force also said this week that it studied the overhaul process and found a problem with how the inlet check valve was assembled during overhauls, said Derek Kaufman, a civilian spokesman for the Air Force Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

There are two approved configurations of the valves. The older configuration uses smaller Teflon backing rings, and newer configurations use larger rings. The team discovered the potential for installation of the wrong-size backing ring since both size rings were packaged side by side, Kaufman said.

As a result, the Air Force changed the process for assembling the valves during overhauls. It separated the installation and inspection steps on the work documentation and added a secondary quality check for just O-ring backing ring installation. And it inserted a “quality stamp” of the entire process for the first six months after the changes to ensure proper training was accomplished.

The Air Force also inspected all of its inlet check valves and found three to be defective. Those were fixed, Kaufman said.

“We review the facts for any lessons that can be applied to maintenance processes and training to improve the safety and quality of systems we deliver to our warfighters,” he said.

The improper installation of two parts caused an [F-16](/weapons/f-16/ "Learn more about the F-16 Fighting Falcon")
‘s hydraulic system to fail, making the pilot [lose control and crash into a warehouse in May 2019](https://www.airforcemag.com/f-16-crashes-during-norad-training-in-california/)
 while flying back to March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Air Force investigators found.

The F-16 pilot successfully ejected before the Viper crashed into the civilian building. The aircraft was destroyed at a loss of $24.99 million, and caused about $3.9 million in damage to the warehouse, according to an Air Combat Command Accident Investigation Board report.

The F-16C, tail number 88-0477 from the South Dakota Air National Guard’s 114th Fighter Wing, was operated by a pilot from the California Air National Guard’s 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 at March for homeland defense missions. On May 16, 2019, the F-16C took off as part of a two-ship formation for an aerospace control alert training mission in a nearby military operating area.

The two F-16s flew one-versus-one tactical intercepts, low-level proficiency training, and local area familiarization. While flying near Palm Springs, the pilot began receiving cockpit warnings of a potential hydraulic system issue with gauges showing low pressure and began going through appropriate checklists, according to the report.

About 20 miles from base, the pilot deployed speed brakes and lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel and let the wingman visually inspect the aircraft. With the speed brakes and gear deployed and locked, the pilot did not yet declare an emergency, but continued the approach to March, the report states.

The aircraft then indicated further loss of pressure in both of its “A and B” systems, and the pilot consulted checklists for dual hydraulic failure. Once they got close to the base, the wingman landed first on one of the base’s runways, allowing the damaged F-16 to land on a runway with an arresting cable.

With both hydraulic systems failing, the pilot declared an emergency and turned on emergency power as a precaution before starting a straight-in approach to the runway. About one mile before touching down, at about 300 feet above ground level, the F-16 began to roll to the left without any pilot input. The pilot tried to maintain control, and counter the roll, but the aircraft rolled hard to the right in a way that was inconsistent with the pilot’s input.

After losing control of the aircraft, the pilot ejected. Immediately after punching out, the F-16 crashed into the warehouse, located across a major highway from the base. A photograph of the impact shows the F-16’s nose sheared off and wings largely removed in a pile of boxes and equipment. The pilot parachuted onto the runway overrun at the base, and was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries.

The Accident Investigation Board found that the cause of the mishap was two improperly installed hydraulic check valves in the aircraft’s right flaperon integrated survoactuator—a part that translates electrical commands to the movement of flight control surfaces. For both of the parts that failed, investigators found the same problem: the retainer on a screw cap had deformed, with fragments tearing away allowing fluid to leak.

“This condition allowed hydraulic fluid to leak from both systems resulting in decreased hydraulic pressure to move flight control surfaces,” the report said. “The \[pilot\] set up to land as soon as possible, but the system had lost enough pressure on final approach to prevent the \[aircraft\] from sustaining controlled flight.”

Maintainers with the 144th Fighter Wing Detachment 1 installed the parts as part of unscheduled maintenance in March 2019 after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered. The parts went through operational checks with no discrepancies found, and the aircraft had flown 10 sorties for 16.3 hours before the crash. The AIB states that there was an inadequate overhaul process, which lacked an effective procedure to identify problems with the installation of the check valves.

At least three high-profile four-star Air Force commands could be downgraded to three-star roles, as the Pentagon presses to shrink the number of generals throughout the Department of Defense, people familiar with the matter told Air & Space Forces Magazine.

Senators this week advanced a $852 billion defense spending bill for 2026 that would block cancellation of the Air Force’s E-7 early-warning aircraft program, continue military aid to Ukraine, and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles in a rebuke of certain Trump administration priorities in the year ahead.

An inlet check valve from the F-16 Fighting Falcon that crashed near March Air Reserve Base on May 16, 2019, is shown during the investigation into the crash. The U.S. Air Force concluded that the valve was improperly installed, leading to a leak of hydraulic fuel that rendered the pilot unable to control the aircraft. (Courtesy of U.S. Air Force)

A loss of hydraulic pressure prevented the pilot of the Air National Guard’s F-16 [that crashed near March Air Reserve Base](https://www.pe.com/2019/05/16/plane-crashes-near-march-air-reserve-base-215-freeway-shut-down/)
 last year from controlling the jet, the U.S. Air Force says in a report.

The pilot ejected and parachuted onto a base runway on May 16, 2019, suffering minor injuries. The $24 million Fighting Falcon plummeted through the roof of a warehouse, destroying the jet and causing a small fire.

Twelve people in the warehouse were treated for exposure to the debris, the Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department said at the time.

The 22-page report, dated April 14, said two inlet-check valves were improperly installed, resulting in damage to them that caused hydraulic fuel to leak.

The valves were part of a flight-control system that was overhauled in January 2019 and installed in the jet after a possible hydraulic leak was discovered several months later.

“The evidence also indicated an inadequate overhaul process that lacked an effective procedure to identify improper installation of ISA check valves,” the report says.

The F-16 was one of two jets initially practicing 120 miles east of March, which sits on the Riverside-Moreno Valley border. The planes were returning to March when the one jet lost hydraulic pressure.

The pilot burned off fuel before ejecting, the report says.

The F-16 was assigned to the 114th Fighter Wing at Joe Foss Field in South Dakota and ran some missions for the 144th Fighter Wing at March.

Ukraine blows up two key Russian bridges using Moscow’s own mines and $600 drones

Ukraine has said it destroyed two bridges inside Russia by using a couple of cheap drones to hit stashes of mines and ammunition hidden there by Russian forces.

The Ukrainian military said the two bridges near the border with Ukraine’s Kharkiv region were being used by the Russian military to resupply their troops.

Because of their strategic importance, the bridges were mined – so that the Russian military had the option of blowing them up in case of a sudden Ukrainian advance.

It is not unusual for an army under attack to destroy bridges, roads and other key infrastructure on its own territory to prevent the enemy from advancing. The move delayed the Russian advance and protected the Ukrainian capital.

In the case of the two bridges in Russia, the Ukrainian military found out about the stashes of mines and used it to its own advantage.

Ukraine Armed Forces — 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade

Ukraine’s 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, which conducted the operation, told CNN that they decided have a closer look at the bridge after noticing unusual activity around it.

“It became clear that something was going on there. We found it was also mined and we struck,” the brigade representative said, adding: “(We) saw an opportunity and took it.”

The bridges’ destruction – and the daring way Ukraine achieved it – is a rare piece of good news for Kyiv.

Ukraine is facing a tough situation along the frontlines as Russian troops continue to inch forward as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to delay any ceasefire talks.

At the same time, Moscow keeps terrorizing Ukraine’s civilian population with near daily deadly aerial attacks against cities across the country.

Russia did not comment on the attacks against the bridges.

Ukraine Armed Forces — 58th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade

Cheap drones prove their value
------------------------------

The drones used in the attack costs between 25,000 and 30,000 Ukrainian hryvnas, or between $600 to $725, the brigade representative told CNN.

That makes the two attacks extremely cost-effective. CNN has geolocated the bridge seen in the video to the Belgorod region in southern Russia, near the border with Ukraine.

“After that, we decided to check the other bridge. Under normal circumstances, it would require expensive guided munitions delivered by a sophisticated system such as a missile launcher or plane.

Ukraine has previously said it used the Western-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to blow up bridges in Russia’s Kursk region."

Claim: "<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:22>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:22>

## Elaboration
The image appears to be a meme. The background shows a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. The foreground features two "soyjak" characters, a type of internet meme, which suggests the image is satirical.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of aircraft or the cause of the damage. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia cannot be verified.

Ukraine claims to have damaged Russian fighter jets in night-time raid
======================================================================

This article is more than 2 months old

Special forces reportedly launched assault on Russian airfield about 400 miles from Ukrainian border

Ukrainian special forces claim to have damaged two fighter jets in a night-time raid on an airfield deep inside [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 as Kyiv seeks to disrupt Vladimir Putin’s steady advances on the frontline.

A week after the spectacle of [Operation Spiderweb, when drones struck the Kremlin’s nuclear-capable bombers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/jun/04/ukraine-releases-dramatic-fpv-footage-of-drone-attack-on-russian-airbases-video)
, the general staff of the Ukrainian army claimed a fresh success.

Special operations forces were said to have launched an assault on the Savasleyka airfield, located in the Nizhny Novgorod region of Russia, about 400 miles from the Ukrainian border.

The army did not provide any details about the nature of the operation and questions remain about the extent of the damage inflicted.

The airfield is used by Russia to deploy MiG-31K fighters carrying Kinzhal ballistic missiles that have been used against Ukrainian armed forces and its cities.

“According to preliminary information, two units of enemy aircraft were hit (probably MiG-31 and Su-30/34 aircraft),” the general staff said in a statement. It has been claimed that this is the home of Ukraine’s F-16 fighter jets although this could not be independently verified.

Explosions were also heard in Kyiv, where Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration, reported that an office building in the capital’s Darnytsia district had been damaged.

The Ukrainian authorities claimed that their air defences destroyed 277 drones and 19 missiles in mid-flight, with only 10 drones or missiles successfully striking their targets.

In recent weeks, Russian forces have made significant advances in the Sumy region, pushing within 18 miles of the eponymous regional capital, three years after Ukraine’s counteroffensive pushed the Kremlin’s forces out of the area.

The region’s governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said there was no need yet to evacuate Sumy city, describing the situation as “tense but under control of the defence forces”.

Ukraine has denied Moscow’s claims that Russian forces have pushed through the western border of Donetsk into the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region for the first time in the three years of the full-scale war.

Maj Andrii Kovalev, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff, said: “The information is not true. We are doing everything we can to bring our people home.”

Video footage also emerged on Monday of a successful Ukrainian drone strike on a factory in Cheboksary, about 800 miles from the Ukrainian border, which makes components crucial to the targeting mechanisms in self-propelled howitzers, Iskander missile systems and Lancet and Shahed kamikaze drones.

[Map](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/russia_nizhnynovgorod/giv-32554V2j0lwWwwudB)

Ukraine’s armed forces said the attack on the VNIIR-Progress plant, which is under US sanctions, had led the authorities in Russia to halt commercial flights in the region.

They said: “At present, the destruction of the facility by at least two UAVs \[unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones\] and the subsequent large-scale fire have been confirmed. The results of the destruction are being clarified.”

Oleg Nikolayev, the regional governor, said in a statement that production at the factory had been suspended but that the strikes had not caused any casualties.

The operations inside Russia came as the Kremlin stepped up its night-time missile and drone strikes and made progress in pushing back the frontline in the north-east Sumy region and in Donetsk in the east.

On Sunday night and in the early hours of Monday morning, Russia launched 479 drones at Ukraine in the war’s biggest overnight drone bombardment, the Ukrainian air force said.

About 20 missiles were also fired into Ukraine, targeting mainly central and western regions. The enemy did not enter Dnipropetrovsk oblast.”

 and Matt Nighswander

Satellite images of destroyed and damaged military aircraft on Russian bases have provided fresh details about Ukraine’s recent unprecedented drone attack on its powerful neighbor.

The images of destroyed and damaged aircraft, dated May 22 and June 4, show some of Russia's prized military assets parked and then destroyed.

Over the weekend, Ukraine's Security Service [said that it had struck more than 40 bombers](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-drone-strike-on-russian-airfield-rcna210210)
 deep inside Russian territory in an operation dubbed "Spiderweb." Video released by Ukraine showed drones targeting the Belaya air base in the Irktusk region, almost 3,000 miles from Ukraine.

The operation made headlines around the world, both as an example of Ukraine's willingness and ingenuity in expanding the war beyond the front lines as well as [the escalating risk that drones pose to military assets](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraines-massive-drone-attack-deep-russia-lays-bare-putins-vulnerabili-rcna210300)
 once thought to be far beyond the reach of adversaries.

Ukraine appears to have targeted Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers, which are considered by military analysts to be [crucial to the Russian air force](https://www.twz.com/air/what-ukraines-unprecedented-drone-attack-means-for-russian-bomber-force)
.

Beyond the military importance, the destruction of the bombers was also a blow to Russia's international standing and the image of [its president, Vladimir Putin](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraines-massive-drone-attack-deep-russia-lays-bare-putins-vulnerabili-rcna210300)
.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there have been instances of aircraft damage and destruction during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Specifically, Ukrainian forces have damaged or destroyed Russian aircraft using drones, and there is a record of an F-16 being lost. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.

The image appears to be a meme. The background shows a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. The foreground features two "soyjak" characters, a type of internet meme, which suggests the image is satirical.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of aircraft or the cause of the damage. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported that in June 2025, Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed dozens of Russian aircraft using drones. The Guardian reported that Ukraine claimed to have damaged Russian fighter jets in a night-time raid on an airfield in Russia on June 9, 2025. The Wikipedia article provides a list of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the Russo-Ukrainian War, including the loss of an ex-Danish Air Force F-16 on August 26, 2023.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-russia-drone-bombers-attack-satellite-images-rcna210943): 
Content: NBC News published an article on June 4, 2025, by Jason Abbruzzese and Matt Nighswander, discussing satellite images showing the destruction of Russian planes by Ukrainian drones. The article mentions Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields, including the Belaya air base, and shows images of damaged Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers <image:1>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there have been instances of aircraft damage and destruction during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Specifically, Ukrainian forces have damaged or destroyed Russian aircraft using drones, and there is a record of an F-16 being lost. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image appears to be a meme depicting a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. While there is evidence of aircraft damage during the Russo-Ukrainian War, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:22> This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:22>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:22>

## Elaboration
The image appears to be a meme. The background shows a damaged aircraft with Ukrainian markings. The foreground features two "soyjak" characters, a type of internet meme, which suggests the image is satirical.

The evidence does not provide information about the type of aircraft or the cause of the damage. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported that in June 2025, Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed dozens of Russian aircraft using drones. The Guardian reported that Ukraine claimed to have damaged Russian fighter jets in a night-time raid on an airfield in Russia on June 9, 2025. The Wikipedia article provides a list of aviation shootdowns and accidents during the Russo-Ukrainian War, including the loss of an ex-Danish Air Force F-16 on August 26, 2023.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-russia-drone-bombers-attack-satellite-images-rcna210943): 
Content: NBC News published an article on June 4, 2025, by Jason Abbruzzese and Matt Nighswander, discussing satellite images showing the destruction of Russian planes by Ukrainian drones. The article mentions Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian airfields, including the Belaya air base, and shows images of damaged Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers <image:1>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there have been instances of aircraft damage and destruction during the Russo-Ukrainian War. Specifically, Ukrainian forces have damaged or destroyed Russian aircraft using drones, and there is a record of an F-16 being lost. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet shot down by Russia. The image's nature as a meme and the lack of specific details about the aircraft in the image make it impossible to verify the claim.
