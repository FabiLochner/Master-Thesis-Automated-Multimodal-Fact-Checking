### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, revealing that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the $1.1 billion. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The audit can be found here: [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability are extensive and growing. It also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration. The fact sheet can be found here: [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine) ![image 3835](media/2025-08-22_23-51-1755906677-227417.jpg) and ![image 3836](media/2025-08-22_23-51-1755906677-937291.jpg).
