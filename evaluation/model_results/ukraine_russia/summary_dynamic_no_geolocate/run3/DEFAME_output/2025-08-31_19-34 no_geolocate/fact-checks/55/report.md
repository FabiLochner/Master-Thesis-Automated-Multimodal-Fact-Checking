## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news outlets, including the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)), debunked a video alleging that USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC identified the video as a Russian disinformation campaign.

The Hollywood Reporter and Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)) reported that the video falsely claimed that celebrities like Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, and Ben Stiller received payments. Ben Stiller denied the claims, and the UNHCR confirmed that Stiller self-funded his trip. The Hollywood Reporter also noted that the video falsely cited "eonline.com" as its source, a claim dismissed by E! News' parent company.
