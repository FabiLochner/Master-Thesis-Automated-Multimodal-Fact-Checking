## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the meeting involved Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) <image:i>. NPR reported that the visit ended abruptly after an "Oval Office spat" and that Zelenskyy was there to finalize a deal on minerals. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) ![image 517](media/2025-08-06_17-46-1754502406-548910.jpg).

Al Jazeera also covered the meeting, highlighting disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. However, none of the sources mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Yahoo News fact-check, citing Snopes, Zelenskyy did not say the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine. Instead, he discussed a hypothetical scenario where the loss of Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving the U.S. The comments were made two years before the February 2025 visit to the White House. ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

VOA News and CNN also published fact checks stating that Zelenskyy did not say American sons and daughters will have to die in Ukraine. ([https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)) <image:k> ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) ![image 522](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502436-263202.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including Yahoo News, VOA News, and CNN, confirm that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. The sources also clarify that Zelenskyy's comments about potential broader conflict were made before the February 2025 White House meeting.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Trump in February 2025 is demonstrably false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including Yahoo News, VOA News, and CNN, have debunked this statement. The sources confirm that Zelenskyy did not make this statement, and any related comments were made at a different time.

`false`
