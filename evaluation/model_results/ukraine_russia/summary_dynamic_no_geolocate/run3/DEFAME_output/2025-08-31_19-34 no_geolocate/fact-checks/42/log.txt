Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/): 
Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The release date is not mentioned. The publisher is the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine): 
Content: The search result is a fact sheet from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) dated February 8, 2024, which addresses claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> and <image:3836>. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement in an AP news interview from February 1, 2025 that his country's military has received only a portion of the more than 175 billion in U.S. aid confirms that the US aid is a money laundering operation.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. The statement attributed to Zelenskyy is not found in the AP News interview from February 1, 2025, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)). Furthermore, the evidence indicates that there is oversight of the funds provided to Ukraine, as the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have reported.

So, the overall veracity is: false
