Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/russia-expanding-chemical-weapons-use-in-ukraine-say-european-spy-agencies): 
Content: Al Jazeera published on July 4, 2025, an article stating that Dutch and German intelligence agencies reported Russia's intensified use of chemical weapons, including chloropicrin, against Ukrainian soldiers, violating international law. The article mentions the OPCW and the Chemical Weapons Convention. The article also mentions the Kursk offensive. <image:12>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-bolstered-by-north-korean-troops-presses-attacks-in-kursk-region/33243288.html): 
Content: The RFE/RL article, published on December 17, 2024, discusses the intensified offensive by Russian forces in the Kursk region, bolstered by North Korean troops. <image:13843> The article mentions that Ukrainian forces are attempting to resist the attacks. It also notes that a senior U.S. military official stated that North Korean forces have suffered casualties in the Kursk fighting. The article does not mention any chemical attacks.

The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Kursk offensive did occur in August 2024, and chemical weapons were used during the offensive, there is no evidence to confirm that the image in question depicts a chemical attack during the Kursk offensive. Therefore, the claim is rated as false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
