### Evidence from `web_search`
On February 28, 2025, Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before meeting with Donald Trump, according to an ABC News article ([https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/zelenskyy-meets-bipartisan-group-senators-ahead-tense-white/story?id=119305439)). ![image 13842](media/2025-08-31_19-49-1756669794-492961.jpg)

NPR reported that Zelenskyy's visit to the White House on the same day ended abruptly after a spat with President Trump ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that on February 28, 2025, Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump. Furthermore, Zelenskyy met with a bipartisan group of senators before the meeting with Trump. The evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy met with Democrats, but it does mention a bipartisan group, which would include Democrats.

Therefore, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that on February 28, 2025, Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump and a bipartisan group of senators, which would include Democrats.
