## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 24](media/75.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reports that Russia claimed the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 (![image 3404](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900652-609245.jpg), ![image 3401](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900648-897066.jpg), ![image 3403](media/2025-08-22_22-10-1755900651-766075.jpg)). The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and stated that those involved would be considered legitimate military targets. Experts suggest that even if American PMCs were present, it wouldn't necessarily mean the U.S. government directed the raid.

The Anadolu Agency also reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the participation of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region (<image:i>).

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and the Anadolu Agency report that Russia protested the presence of American mercenaries in the Kursk region during Ukraine's incursion in August 2024. The image shows individuals with American flags on their uniforms. However, the evidence does not confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries or that they participated in the incursion.
