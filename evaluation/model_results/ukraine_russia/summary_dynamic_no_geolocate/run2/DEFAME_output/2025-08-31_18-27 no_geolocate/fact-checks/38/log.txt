Useful result: From [Source](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/): 
Content: The New York Post reports that House Republicans launched an investigation into Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, describing it as a campaign stop to benefit Kamala Harris. The article mentions that the Biden-Harris Administration flew Zelenskyy on an American taxpayer-funded flight to Pennsylvania, a battleground state. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer demanded communications about Zelensky’s visit to a Scranton ammunition factory with Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a key Harris backer. Comer stated that the committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign. <image:13457>, <image:13459>, <image:13460>.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: Based on the evidence, the claim is **partially supported**. While there is evidence of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, in September 2024, and that Republicans viewed it as a campaign event for Kamala Harris, there is no direct evidence that Zelenskyy was actively campaigning for Harris. The visit, however, led to an investigation by House Republicans, who also viewed it as a campaign stop.

So, the overall veracity is: false
