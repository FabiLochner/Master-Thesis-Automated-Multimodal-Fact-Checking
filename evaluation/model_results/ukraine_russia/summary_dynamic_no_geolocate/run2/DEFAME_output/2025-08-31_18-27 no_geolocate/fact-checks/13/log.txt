Content: The World Economic Forum published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address at the Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from January 15â€“19, 2024. Zelenskyy called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy at the World Economic Forum. <image:10>

Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the photo of Zelenskyy and Schwab in suits was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits publicly. <image:10>

The claim '<image:10> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wearing a suit after the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine: in a talk with Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum, as confirmed by the World Economic Forum's article. However, the photo was taken in January 2020, as stated by Yahoo News, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, making the claim inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
