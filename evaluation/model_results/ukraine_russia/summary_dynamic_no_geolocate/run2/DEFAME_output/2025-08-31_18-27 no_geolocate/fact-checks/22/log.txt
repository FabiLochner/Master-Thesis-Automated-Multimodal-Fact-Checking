The claim '<image:12> This image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While there are reports of chemical weapons use in the context of the Ukraine war, the evidence indicates that Russia is the primary actor accused of using such weapons, not Ukraine. Furthermore, there is no evidence linking the image to a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.

So, the overall veracity is: false
