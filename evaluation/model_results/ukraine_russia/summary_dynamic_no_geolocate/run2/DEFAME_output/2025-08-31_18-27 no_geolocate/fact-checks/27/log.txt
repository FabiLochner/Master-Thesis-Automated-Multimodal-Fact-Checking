Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html): 
Content: The article from AOL, published on April 24, 2022, discusses Volodymyr Zelenskyy's net worth. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion. His annual salary as Ukrainian president is approximately $11,200. The article mentions that Zelenskyy's 2018 financial disclosure listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias. <image:1936>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including [Detector Media](https://www.detector.media/en/infospace/article/160777/fake-news-about-zelenskyys-property-in-florida-is-part-of-russian-propaganda/), debunk the assertion that Zelenskyy owns a $35 million home in Florida. Furthermore, reports from [AOL](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) indicate that his net worth and income are significantly lower than what the claim suggests.

So, the overall veracity is: false
