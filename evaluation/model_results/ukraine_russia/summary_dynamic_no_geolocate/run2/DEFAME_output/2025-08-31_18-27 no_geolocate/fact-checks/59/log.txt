Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on January 15, 2025, debunks a claim circulating on social media that lists US politicians who allegedly received bribes from Ukraine. The article states that the image, which includes Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitt Romney, is false and lacks evidence. It notes that no legitimate news outlets have reported on the claims, and the claims have been debunked by other fact-checkers. The article also mentions that the claims originate from at least 2023 and are part of a disinformation campaign. <image:18>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217): 
Content: The BBC News published on July 21, 2023, discusses an FBI document released by a top Senate Republican detailing an allegation that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. <image:13726>, <image:13728>, <image:13730>. The document contains claims from a foreign informant, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory): 
Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses the Bidenâ€“Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe to pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor to protect his son, Hunter Biden. The article states that this theory is a series of false allegations and that a joint investigation by two Republican Senate committees found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. The article also mentions Russian involvement in spreading these false allegations. <image:18>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory), debunk the image's authenticity and state that there is no evidence to support the claim that it is a list of bribes from Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
