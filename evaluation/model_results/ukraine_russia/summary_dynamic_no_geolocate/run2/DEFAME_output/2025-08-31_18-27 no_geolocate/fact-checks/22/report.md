### Evidence from `image_search`
The Voice of America published an article about the Kursk offensive, including an image of an explosion (![image 13427](media/2025-08-31_18-46-1756665977-327330.jpg)). ABC News also published an article about the Kursk offensive (![image 13428](media/2025-08-31_18-46-1756665978-499315.jpg)). CNN published an article about the Ukraine war (![image 13429](media/2025-08-31_18-46-1756665979-051973.jpg)).

All sources discuss the Kursk offensive or the Ukraine war, but none mention a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that both sides have accused each other of using chemical weapons. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive in August 2024. The search results mention the Kursk offensive and chemical weapons use, but they do not connect the two in the context of the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Dutch and German intelligence agencies said Russia has intensified its use of chemical weapons, including chloropicrin, against Ukrainian soldiers, and includes an image of a Ukrainian soldier in a trench (![image 13418](media/2025-08-31_18-45-1756665951-055547.jpg)). The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) stated that the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces used ammunition equipped with chemical agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) 434 times in Ukraine in December 2024, contributing to a total of 5,389 documented cases since February 2023 (![image 13430](media/2025-08-31_18-48-1756666101-486272.jpg), ![image 13431](media/2025-08-31_18-48-1756666107-756796.jpg)). Neither source mentions a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.


## Elaboration
The evidence consistently points to accusations of chemical weapons use, primarily against Ukrainian forces, with Russia being the main actor accused. The claim, however, asserts the opposite. There is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Russia has been accused of using chemical weapons in Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While there are reports of chemical weapons use in the context of the Ukraine war, the evidence indicates that Russia is the primary actor accused of using such weapons, not Ukraine. Furthermore, there is no evidence linking the image to a chemical attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Kursk offensive.
