## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of The Economist cover featuring Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin with the word "APOCALYPSE" is a fake.

[PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-front-cover-was-not-published-by-the-economist-cd0c20d99b9b) also confirms the cover is altered, and [AAP FactCheck](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/fake-economist-apocalypse-cover-linked-to-pro-kremlin-propaganda/) notes spelling and grammatical errors, and that the image was promoted by a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel.
