## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. Articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Trump%E2%80%93Zelenskyy_Oval_Office_meeting)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) detail disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances.

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)) also reported on the meeting, noting it ended abruptly after a spat. None of the articles mention Zelenskyy stating the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple fact-check articles from various news sources, including Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)), VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)), debunk the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

These articles clarify that Zelenskyy was discussing a hypothetical scenario where a loss for Ukraine could lead to a broader conflict involving American soldiers. The CNN article includes an image ![image 522](media/2025-08-06_17-47-1754502436-263202.jpg) with a checkmark.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple fact-checking articles from reputable news sources, such as Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-zelenskyy-saying-us-120000537.html)), VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6993247.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)), debunk the claim. These articles clarify that Zelenskyy was discussing a hypothetical scenario.

Furthermore, while there was a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025, none of the provided sources about the meeting mention Zelenskyy making the statement in question.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine after a heated exchange with Trump is false. Fact-check articles from multiple reliable sources debunk this statement. While there was a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump, the alleged quote is not supported by any evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple fact-checking articles from sources like Yahoo News, VOA News, and CNN debunk the statement, clarifying that Zelenskyy did not make the alleged statement. While there was a contentious meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump in February 2025, no evidence supports the claim that Zelenskyy made the statement during the meeting.
