Useful result: From [Source](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/): Found exact image on website with title: Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he ...
Content: The image <image:7> appears in an article from Telegrafi.com, which reports that Zelensky visited the front line in the Kharkiv region. The article was published 3 years ago. The article also includes other images of Zelensky. <image:1659>, <image:1660>, <image:1661>, <image:1662>, <image:1663>. The article does not mention Sudzha or the Kursk region.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms Ukrainian advances into the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, there is no evidence to support the image depicting Zelensky in Sudzha during that time, nor is there any information about a meeting with local representatives.

So, the overall veracity is: false
