The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Adam Schiff faced committee assignment issues, the evidence indicates that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, not Majority Leader John Thune, was responsible for blocking Schiff from a House committee, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151335616/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee-assignments).

So, the overall veracity is: false
