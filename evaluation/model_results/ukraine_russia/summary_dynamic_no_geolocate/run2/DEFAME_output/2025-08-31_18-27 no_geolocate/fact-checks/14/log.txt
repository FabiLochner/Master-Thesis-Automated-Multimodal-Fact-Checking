Content: The article from Gwara Media debunks a claim that Fox News published an article stating that the "Psychological and Information Warfare Center of Ukraine" received $140,000,000 per month from USAID.

The article also mentions that the Telegram channel "Медведь" spread the disinformation. <image:1806>, <image:1805>, <image:1804>. The article was published on February 27, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-disinformation-spikes-after-trump-zelenskyy-row/a-71832118): 
Content: The DW article fact-checks a claim that a Fox News article reported that USAID pays $140 million per month to Ukraine's Psychological and Information Warfare Center. The article states that a manipulated screenshot of an alleged Fox News article has been circulating on social media. The article states that there was no mention of a $140-million-per-month disbursement to a "Psychological and Information Warfare Center" in a 2024 report by the Special Inspector General to the US Congress. The article also mentions that the "psychological operations unit" is part of Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SOF). <image:x>

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Psychological_and_Information_Warfare_Center_(Ukraine)): 
Content: The 72nd Psychological and Information Warfare Center is a unit of the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces concerned with psychological and informational warfare. It was established in 2003. The center is currently engaged in psychological warfare during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. <image:11>
