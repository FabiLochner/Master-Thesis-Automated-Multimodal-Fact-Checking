Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on January 15, 2025, debunks a claim circulating on social media that lists US politicians, including Joe Biden, who allegedly received bribes from Ukraine. The article states that there is no evidence to support these claims and that the image has been circulating since at least 2023. <image:18>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217): 
Content: The BBC News article from July 21, 2023, discusses an FBI document released by a top Senate Republican, detailing an allegation that Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm. <image:13144>, <image:13149>, <image:13151>. The document contains claims from a foreign informant, but there is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine. The article mentions that the allegations are similar to those aired by Biden's political opponents.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses the Bidenâ€“Ukraine conspiracy theory, which alleges that Joe Biden improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe to pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor to protect his son. The article mentions that these allegations were spread to damage Joe Biden's reputation during the 2020 presidential campaign. The article also mentions Russian involvement in spreading these false allegations. <image:18> shows the image in the claim.

The claim '<image:18> This image shows an authentic list realeased by Ukraine showing US politicians taking bribes from Ukraine. The highest bribe was 92 Million US-$ for Joe Biden.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including a Euronews article ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/15/old-false-claims-resurface-about-ukrainian-kickbacks-to-us-politicians)) and a BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66272217)), debunk the assertion that the image depicts a list of US politicians who received bribes from Ukraine. The evidence indicates that there is no factual basis for the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
