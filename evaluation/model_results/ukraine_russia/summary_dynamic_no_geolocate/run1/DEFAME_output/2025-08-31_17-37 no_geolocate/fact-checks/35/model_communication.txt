**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

Evidence Showing Biden Did Not Board 'Empty Plane'
--------------------------------------------------

[Mediaite.com](https://www.mediaite.com/online/conservatives-insist-biden-confusingly-boarded-wrong-airplane-heres-what-actually-happened/)
 published that The Independent's White House correspondent [Andrew Feinberg](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/andrew-feinberg)
 — who served as White House pool reporter at Joint Base Andrews — confirmed Biden boarded the plane to greet the people still onboard after the freed prisoners had deplaned. The caption clearly states Biden stepped onto the plane "to talk to the pilot who flew the former prisoners."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.
> 
> — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) [August 1, 2024](https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1819025395804717182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, **Stephen Capus**, has [said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-prisoner-swap-belarus-gershkovich-whelan-alsu/33059280.html)
 that the broadcaster welcomed news of RFE/RL journalist **Alsu Kurmasheva**’s “imminent release and are grateful to the American government and all who worked tirelessly to end her unjust treatment by Russia.”

> Alsu’s release makes us even more determined to secure the freedom of three other RFE/RL journalists, cruelly imprisoned in Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimea.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans arrived. However, the claim that the plane was empty is not entirely accurate. According to the Times of India, Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. Yahoo News reported that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home. The Guardian also shows Biden greeting one of the freed prisoners on the tarmac.

The evidence suggests that Biden's actions were related to the arrival of the freed Americans, but the claim's assertion that he boarded an empty plane is not fully supported. The evidence suggests that the plane was not empty, as the flight crew was present.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/politics/biden-greeting-freed-prisoners.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article about Joe Biden greeting freed prisoners in August 2024. The article includes an image of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the tarmac with a plane. <image:7168>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden did board a plane after the freed Americans arrived. However, the claim that the plane was empty is not entirely accurate. According to the Times of India, Biden boarded the plane to thank the flight crew. Yahoo News reported that Biden boarded the plane to speak to those who helped bring the prisoners home. The Guardian also shows Biden greeting one of the freed prisoners on the tarmac.

The evidence suggests that Biden's actions were related to the arrival of the freed Americans, but the claim's assertion that he boarded an empty plane is not fully supported. The evidence suggests that the plane was not empty, as the flight crew was present.

Content: "26, 2024, 6:29 AM EDT

By [Alex Seitz-Wald](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/alex-seitz-wald-ncpn385646)
 and [Katherine Doyle](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/katherine-doyle-ncpn1304357)

Vice President Kamala Harris is meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a trip to the U.S., while former President Donald Trump isn’t, highlighting the growing partisan division over a key foreign policy issue.

Harris is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelenskyy at the White House. Democratic criticism of Trump's position on Ukraine has frequently nodded to years of suggestions that he was indebted to Putin and unwilling to cross him.

“That’s not who we are as Americans,” she said before she invoked, in a nod to the electoral stakes, the votes of 800,000 Polish Americans in Pennsylvania, a number roughly 10 times the margin by which Biden won in 2020 and 20 times Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. 

Poland is one of Russia’s strongest opponents, and pro-Harris forces have [run ads](https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-polish-american-voters-trump-4a0bb4126ab2ded70cf78bb76501d7d9)
 specifically targeting Polish Americans. NBC News had reported that Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda were to visit a Catholic shrine together last Sunday, but the trip was scrapped for logistical reasons, according to a campaign source familiar with the planning. 

But Harris hasn’t detailed many specifics about how she would oversee the war effort as president, especially if Republicans in Congress lose appetite for approving more funds for the country.

Some outside the administration argue that despite the heated rhetoric of the campaign, Harris might also look for ways to help wind down the war amid the stark political realities a future Harris administration would face.

“I think they recognize that having a war without end on NATO’s eastern flank is not in the enduring interests of the alliance or, frankly, the American interest, either,” said Smith, of Stand Together.

Sept. Since the possibility of Trump’s returning to power became more realistic, Zelenskyy has [appeared to tread carefully](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/10/europe/ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-delphi-economic-forum-intl/index.html)
 at times when he discusses Trump or responds to his criticism.

Ukraine has mostly enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress since Russia invaded it in 2022. support, it might be difficult for Ukraine to keep up the fight against Russia.

The partisan divide appeared to grow this week after Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden's hometown, which Trump and other Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. 

Republicans also took issue with recent comments Zelenskyy made to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-new-yorker-interview/volodymyr-zelensky-has-a-plan-for-ukraines-victory)
 in which he called Trump’s running mate, Sen. over the Pennsylvania trip.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,” Johnson wrote. We cannot look away, and we will not let up on our support for Ukraine,” he said. 

Harris has echoed that message, [telling Zelenskyy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/02/17/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-and-president-zelenskyy-of-ukraine-in-joint-press-conference-munich-germany/)
 in February that “we will be with you for as long as it takes.”

Trump has a long history of praising Putin, and he has vowed to end the war on his first day back in the White House, though he has refused to say how or whether he wants Kyiv to win. 

“I want the war to stop,” Trump when he was pressed during his only debate with Harris. 26, 2024, 5:00 AM EDT / Updated Sept. Trump won't meet with him while he's in the country this week for the United Nations General Assembly, and he has grown increasingly critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of having a favorite in the coming election.

“The president of Ukraine is in our country, and he’s making little nasty aspersions toward your favorite president, me,” Trump said Wednesday in North Carolina. Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”

Zelenskyy had implied that he was going to meet with Trump this week, but Trump's campaign said there had been no formal agreement for a meeting.

Trump has been saying for months, and he has repeated more frequently at rallies this week, that he would immediately end the war in Ukraine — even if it was on terms favorable to Moscow — and he dismissed Zelenskyy as a “great salesman” for securing money for his country who “so badly” wants Democrats to win to keep the money flowing.

“Every time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,” Trump said Tuesday in Georgia."

Content: "Harris, standing with Zelenskyy, indirectly jabs at Trump and Vance on Ukraine views
====================================================================================

She took aim at those who've floated Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.

By[Alexandra Hutzler](https://abcnews.go.com/author/alexandra_hutzler)

September 26, 2024, 6:13 PM

Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday pledged to continue support to Ukraine as she met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss his so-called "victory plan" to bring an end to war with Russia.

Harris cast the conflict as a fight for fundamental principles of "freedom and independence."

"We also know that other would-be aggressors around the world are watching to see what happens in Ukraine," Harris said. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable," she added.

Harris also appeared to take a swipe at her political opponents -- former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. 26, 2024, in the vice president's ceremonial office inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex.

After sources said Wednesday Trump was not expected to meet with Zelenskyy, Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon Zelenskyy had asked to meet and that they would do so Friday morning at Trump Tower.

"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelenskyy quite quickly," Trump said. We need to stop the death and destruction."

Zelenskyy has called Vance "too radical," taking issue with his [statements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/12/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war-plan/)
 that a Trump-Vance administration's approach to the war would likely include Ukraine ceding territory to Russia and the current line of demarcation becoming a demilitarized zone. Johnson told reporters he would not be in town, but if he had sat down with Zelenskyy, would have aired grievances about his tour of an American munitions manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania.

Zelenskyy made the case to lawmakers for permission to strike deeper into Russia at military targets using U.S.-supplied weapons. Several senators on both sides of the aisle expressed a desire for Biden to give Zelenskyy authorization to do so.

On September 9, on hearing about the whistleblower complaint, three Democratic-controlled House committees—the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform—announced they would investigate whether Trump and Giuliani attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding the military aid.[\[232\]](#cite_note-234)

 was about "the fact that we don't want our people, like vice-president Biden and his son, \[adding\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine".[\[238\]](#cite_note-240)

Republican senator [Ron Johnson](/wiki/Ron_Johnson "Ron Johnson")
 told _The Wall Street Journal_ in October that American ambassador [Gordon Sondland](/wiki/Gordon_Sondland "Gordon Sondland")

 Sondland told a State department diplomat in September via text message that there was no _quid pro quo_.[\[240\]](#cite_note-242)
 On October 12, however, _The Washington Post_ reported that, according to a person familiar with Sondland's testimony, Sondland plans to testify to Congress that the content of that text message "was relayed to him directly by President Trump in a phone call" and that he did not know if the claim denying _quid pro quo_ was actually true.[\[241\]](#cite_note-243)

_The Wall Street Journal_ reported on October 10 that career civil servants at the [Office of Management and Budget](/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget "Office of Management and Budget")
 were concerned about the legality of freezing the aid funds, and that the White House granted a political appointee, Michael Duffey, the authority to keep the aid on hold.[\[242\]](#cite_note-244)
 Partially redacted OMB emails released to the [Center for Public Integrity](/wiki/Center_for_Public_Integrity "Center for Public Integrity")

 Unredacted versions of the emails subsequently acquired by _Just Security_ showed that the Pentagon repeatedly pushed back against the hold, citing legal concerns, but Duffey stated, "clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold". During that trip; he pressured Zelenskyy to fire board members of [Naftogaz](/wiki/Naftogaz "Naftogaz")

The reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election underscored the extent to which Trump’s lingering fury over an inquiry he has misleadingly branded a “hoax” remains top of mind more than eight years after it began.

It also showed that Trump’s view of a war Russia launched against Ukraine three years ago is colored not only by his relationship with Putin and the alliance he believes they share but also by his fraught past with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was a central player in the first of two impeachment cases against Trump during his first four years in office.

Here’s a look at what the American president means when he says “Russia, Russia, Russia.”

Investigations tied to Putin connections
----------------------------------------

Questions over Trump’s connections to Putin followed him into his first presidency and hung over him for most of his term, spurring investigations by the Justice Department and Congress and the appointment of a special counsel who brought criminal charges against multiple Trump allies.

While running for office, Trump cast doubt on the idea that Russian government hackers had stolen the emails of Democrats, including his 2016 rival Hillary Clinton, and orchestrated their public release in an effort to boost his candidacy and harm hers.

[**READ MORE:** The full, redacted Mueller report](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-the-redacted-mueller-report)

Then, as president, he broke with his own intelligence community’s firm finding that Russia and Russia alone was to blame for the hack. But the inquiry did not find sufficient evidence to prove that the two sides had illegally colluded to tip the outcome of the election.

‘Do us a favor’
---------------

If Trump’s history with Russia appears to have contributed to his worldview of the current conflict, so too has his past with Ukraine.

He held a call in 2019 with Zelenskyy and pushed him to investigate corruption allegations against Democratic rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter ahead of the 2020 election, which Joe Biden went on to win.

The call — which included Trump’s memorable line: “I would like you to do us a favor, though” — was reported to congressional leaders and to a government watchdog by a CIA officer-turned-whistleblower who said the president appeared to be soliciting interference from a foreign country in the U.S. [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/ "PBS News")

How Trump’s history with Putin and Zelenskyy set the stage for an Oval Office blowup
====================================================================================

[Politics](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics)
 Mar 3, 2025 5:45 PM EDT

WASHINGTON (AP) — As his White House meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart devolved into a stunning blowup, President Donald Trump leaned on a familiar refrain to explain his unique kinship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

“Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump said Friday, raising his voice and gesturing with his hands as he recounted the long-since-concluded saga of a federal investigation in which both he and the Russian president played starring roles.

“He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. intelligence officials by saying, “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”

He added that “I don’t see any reason why it would be” Russia.

All the while, he memorably raged against the investigation, calling it a “hoax” and “witch hunt” and, as he did at the White House last week, repeatedly deriding all the “Russia, Russia, Russia” attention.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation wrapped up in 2019 and left no doubt that Russia had interfered in the election in sweeping and criminal fashion and that the Trump campaign had welcomed the help. election.

After Trump’s call with Zelenskyy, the White House temporarily halted U.S. During his first term, he also seemingly bought into a long-discredited conspiracy theory that connects Ukraine, not Russia, to the 2016 political interference and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and repeatedly accused the FBI of a lackluster investigation that led to the blaming of the Kremlin.

What happens next?
------------------

The long-term repercussions of the Oval Office spat, in which Trump called Zelenskyy “disrespectful” in the most hostile public exchange in memory between world leaders at the White House, remain to be seen.

But the immediate consequences are clear: Zelenskyy left Washington without signing a minerals deal that Trump said would have moved Ukraine closer to ending its war with Russia.

He’s not welcome back, Trump said on social media, until he’s “ready for Peace.” On Monday, the U.S. president again blasted the Ukrainian leader after Zelenskyy noted that a deal to end the war “is still very, very far away.”

With the U.S.-Ukraine relationship now in jeopardy, Zelenskyy has used a series of posts on X to express his thanks to the American people, Trump and Congress for “all the support.”

European leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have embraced Zelenskyy in the aftermath of the White House fight.

In Russia, officials are relishing the conflict, sensing an opportunity to move closer to the U.S. Even when he begrudgingly conceded that Russia might be responsible, he also suggested the culprit might be a “400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.”

In July 2018, while meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump appeared to embrace the Russian leader’s protestations over the conclusions of U.S. aid to the struggling ally facing hostile Russian forces at its border. The money was eventually released as Congress intervened.

Trump was subsequently impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.

The president’s skepticism of Ukraine went beyond the call."

Trump-Zelenskyy feud escalates as Republicans demand envoy’s removal

Zelenskyy’s visit to Pennsylvania weapons factory upsets speaker as Trump continues attacks on Ukrainian president

The US House speaker, [Mike Johnson](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-johnson)
, has demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington as the feud between Donald Trump and Volodymr Zelenskyy escalated and Republicans accused the Ukrainian leader of election interference.

In a public letter, [Johnson demanded that Zelenskyy fire the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova](https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1839022358360649796)
, over a visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, last week where the Ukrainian president thanked workers for providing desperately needed shells to his outgunned forces.

Johnson complained that Markarova had organised the visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant as a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats”. The event was attended by the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who has campaigned in support of Kamala Harris.

“The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because – on purpose – no [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)
 were invited,” Johnson wrote in a letter on congressional letterhead addressed to the Ukrainian embassy.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” the letter continued. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on Sunday. She should be removed from her post immediately.”

On the same day, Trump in a campaign event in North Carolina attacked Zelenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Vladimir Putin.

“The president of [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 is in our country. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”

The accusations against Zelenskyy came after a controversial interview with the New Yorker in which he questioned Trump’s plan to end Ukraine’s war with Russia and sharply criticized Republicans’ vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, as “too radical”.

Vance had earlier said a peace in Ukraine could entail Russia retaining the Ukrainian land it had occupied and the establishment a demilitarised zone with a heavily fortified frontline to prevent another Russian invasion.

“His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,” Zelenskyy said in the interview with the New Yorker. But I do not consider this concept of his a plan, in any formal sense.”

After [addressing the United Nations general assembly on Wednesday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/25/russia-ukraine-zelensky-un-speech)
, Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington to present his “victory plan” to Joe Biden at the White House.

In his letter, Johnson also referred to Ukrainian officials criticizing Trump and Vance in remarks to the media.

“Additionally, as I have clearly stated in the past, all foreign nations should avoid opining on or interfering in American domestic politics,” he said. “Support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested and needlessly tarnished when the candidates at the top of the Republican presidential ticket are targeted in the media by officials in your government.”

Other top Republicans had criticized Zelenskyy this week after his remarks about Trump and Vance were published.

“I don’t mind him going to a munitions plant thanking people for helping Ukraine. “This shortsighted and intentionally political move has caused Republicans to lose trust in Ambassador Markarova’s ability to fairly and effectively serve as a diplomat in this country."

# Your Analysis

The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US politics. One source discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including a phone call where Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, and a 2022 visit by Zelenskyy to the United States (<image:k>). Another source mentions a 2019 call where Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election (<image:k>).

A September 25, 2024, article in The Guardian discusses a visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he thanked workers. Mike Johnson claimed this event was a "partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats" and "clearly election interference." The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the event (<image:5542>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions, specifically his visit to a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and meetings with US officials. While these events occurred, there is no definitive evidence that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Kamala Harris.

 for abuse of power under the theory that he attempted to use a foreign leader—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—to benefit his 2020 presidential campaign, despite a lack of any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of President Trump," Chairman Comer wrote in a press release Wednesday.

A 30-minute phone call between then-president Trump and Zelenskyy in 2019, where the former president asked Zelenskyy to investigate the activities of his then rival President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, was [a part of the impeachment inquiry](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/12/i-would-like-you-to-do-us-a-favor-the-30-minute-phone-call-that-changed-trumps-presidency.html)

"The [Biden-Harris Administration](https://www.cnbc.com/white-house/)
 recently flew the same foreign leader—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—on an American-taxpayer-funded flight to Pennsylvania, a battleground state in the upcoming 2024 presidential election, which has been described as the 'trickiest battleground for Vice President Kamala Harris to win," Comer continued.

Comer sought more information on government resources used for and all internal and external communications regarding the trip in letters sent to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Attorney General Merrick Garland and White House Counsel Edward Siskel.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also sent a sternly worded letter about the Pennsylvania trip Wednesday. James Comer opened an investigation into Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Sunday visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania with three Democrats, two of whom are up for reelection in November.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S., September 22, 2024. 

Ukrainian Presidential Press Service | Reuters

House Oversight Chair James Comer is opening an investigation into Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.cnbc.com/id/10001247)
's Sunday visit to an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. JD Vance was "too radical" and his message "seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice," in ending the war with Russia.

When asked if Ukraine should cede land in exchange for a ceasefire with Russia in a press conference Wednesday, Vance said "everything is going to be on the table."

Comer's letter also criticized the timing of the visit with the publishing of Zelenskyy's comments regarding Trump's running mate.

The ammunition factory that Zelenskyy visited is operated by [General Dynamics](/quotes/GD/)
 and manufactures components for 155 mm artillery shells, a crucial piece of ammunition to Ukraine's battle efforts.The United States had shipped more than 3 million rounds of it to Ukraine since February 2022, according to a [Pentagon fact sheet](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jul/03/2003497646/-1/-1/1/UKRAINE-FACT-SHEET-3-JULY.PDF)
 from July 2024

On Wednesday, the Defense Department announced additional security assistance of $375 million for Ukraine, including more of the 155 mm artillery shells that the Scranton factory specializes in manufacturing.

"I began my visit to the United States by expressing my gratitude to all the employees at the plant and by reaching agreements to expand cooperation between Pennsylvania and our Zaporizhzhia," Zelenskyy wrote on X Sunday.

There, Zelenskyy also met with three Pennsylvania Democrats; Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and Rep. Comer claims that the trip was organized to campaign for Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.cnbc.com/kamala-harris/)
' bid for [presidency](https://www.cnbc.com/elections/)
, and was done using "taxpayer-funded resources."

The Republican investigation comes as the relationship between [Zelenskyy](https://www.cnbc.com/volodymyr-zelenskyy/)
 and former president Donald Trump seems to sour.

On Wednesday, Trump accused Zelenskyy of insulting him — Trump said the Ukrainian president was "making nasty little dispersions toward" him — and adding that he got along with Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.cnbc.com/vladimir-putin/)

The article also mentions that Representative James Comer is investigating the matter.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results confirm Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. AP News, Sky News, and kget.com all provide images of the visit (<image:13012>, <image:13013>, <image:13014>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This visit, along with his meetings with US officials, has been interpreted by some as a sign of support for Kamala Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. The claim relies on interpretations of his actions.

    AP QUIZZES
    
    [Test Your News I.Q. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Newsweek reports that during an Oval Office meeting, JD Vance accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, mentioning a September 2024 visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania (<image:2050>, <image:2051>, <image:2052>). The article also mentions that Representative James Comer is investigating the matter. NBC News reports on the growing partisan divide regarding Ukraine, mentioning a meeting between Zelenskyy and Harris, and that Republicans viewed Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election (<image:i>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US politics. One source discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including a phone call where Trump asked Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden, and a 2022 visit by Zelenskyy to the United States (<image:k>). Another source mentions a 2019 call where Trump pushed Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election (<image:k>).

A September 25, 2024, article in The Guardian discusses a visit by Zelenskyy to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he thanked workers. Mike Johnson claimed this event was a "partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats" and "clearly election interference." The Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, attended the event (<image:5542>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results confirm Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. AP News, Sky News, and kget.com all provide images of the visit (<image:13012>, <image:13013>, <image:13014>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms Zelenskyy's visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This visit, along with his meetings with US officials, has been interpreted by some as a sign of support for Kamala Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. The claim relies on interpretations of his actions.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there is a dispute over whether Zelenskyy engaged in election interference. Some Republicans, including JD Vance and Mike Johnson, have accused Zelenskyy of campaigning for Kamala Harris, citing his visit to a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a partisan event. However, the evidence does not provide definitive proof that Zelenskyy was explicitly campaigning for Harris. The claim is based on interpretations of Zelenskyy's actions and statements.

The evidence shows that Zelenskyy met with Harris and other lawmakers, and his visit to Pennsylvania was attended by the state's governor. These events have been interpreted by some as a sign of preference in the upcoming election.

The available information is insufficient to definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to determine Zelenskyy's intentions and whether his actions constituted election interference.

“They may have their own relations, but talking about Ukraine without us — it is dangerous for everyone,” Zelenskyy said.

He said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

“We need to work more on this,” he said, adding that Trump understandably appeared to be focused on domestic issues in the first weeks after his inauguration.

, a longstanding wish for Kyiv that Moscow has categorically rejected, is still Zelenskyy’s top choice.

NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine’s allies, and it would also strengthen Trump geopolitically, Zelenskyy argued.

“I really believe that these are the cheapest security guarantees that Ukraine can get, the cheapest for everyone,” he said.

“It will be a signal that it is not for Russia to decide who should be in NATO and who should not, but for the United States of America to decide."

The massive budget bill signed by President Donald Trump will result in sharp cuts to food benefits for the neediest Americans. [Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 said his administration has had “very serious” discussions with Russia, but he did not elaborate.

Zelenskyy said his team has been in contact with the Trump administration, but those discussions are at a “general level,” and he believes in-person meetings will take place soon to develop more detailed agreements.

A planned visit by Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellog was postponed. Zelenskyy said Putin interprets negotiating directly with Kyiv as losing.

He said Trump could bring Putin to the table through the threat of sanctions targeting Russia’s energy and banking system, as well as continued support of the Ukrainian military.

NATO is the 'cheapest' security guarantee option

Zelenskyy said NATO membership is the “cheapest” option for Ukraine's allies, and it would strengthen Trump geopolitically.

Other scenarios that involve arming and training Ukraine’s 800,000-strong army would be expensive for U.S. troops.

Approving Ukraine’s NATO bid would be “a great victory” for Trump, Zelenskyy added, in an apparent appeal to the president’s penchant for winners and business deals.

Skepticism about putting European troops in Ukraine

Zelenskyy said a French proposal to put European forces in Ukraine as a deterrent force is taking shape, but he expressed skepticism, saying many questions remained about the command-and-control structure and the number of troops and their positions.

Zelenskyy said he told both French President Emmanuel Marcon and Trump that the option of putting European troops in Ukraine was welcome, but it would not be a sufficient security guarantee alone.

He added: “Imagine, there is a contingent. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)](https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000197-b27c-d052-a3ff-b27dd7c50000/june-27-pyss-w03.jpg?update-time=1751046429007&size=responsive640)

When the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called AP’s senior producer in Kyiv, Volodymyr Yurchuk, to request a sit-down, on-camera interview within 24 hours, it marked a significant milestone. Their work has reinforced AP’s influence as a go-to news outlet for Zelenskyy’s most critical interviews.

For their tenacity, ingenuity, and hustle, the AP Kyiv team earns this week’s Best of AP — Second Winner.

AP Interview: Zelenskyy says excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia talks about war is ‘very dangerous’
===================================================================================================

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures as he speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Kyiv, Ukraine, Saturday, Feb. While the Kyiv team has tirelessly lobbied the Ukrainian government for access and interviews throughout the country’s nearly three-year conflict with Russia—and secured previous sit-downs with Zelenskyy—this was the first time his office approached AP to propose an interview.

With just hours to prepare, the entire team sprang into action. Reporter Illia Novikov provided live, simultaneous translation, longtime photographer Efrem Lukatsky captured images, and Yurchuk produced the video.

The result: an hourlong interview in which Zelenskyy warned that excluding Ukraine from U.S.-Russia war talks is “very dangerous,” called for Kyiv and Washington to develop a ceasefire plan, and outlined his latest thinking on security guarantees needed for a peace deal and NATO membership.

The judges were impressed by the team’s ability to move quickly and deliver such a polished and impactful interview under intense time constraints. 1, 2025\

Inspector General Robert P. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. 

As a result, the DoD lacks assurance that $1.1 billion of Ukraine supplemental funds were used as intended, and the DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. Without sufficient documentation to justify and verify these payments, the DoD cannot provide assurance or transparency to the public, DoD leadership, or Congress regarding using the Ukraine assistance funds. Additionally, if the DoD does not implement the recommendations in this report, the control issues identified could also apply to the more than $76 billion of additional Ukraine supplemental funding appropriated after 2022.

The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management, including that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, develop and implement guidance that requires DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funding appropriated for a specific purpose. 

An official website of the United States government

Here's how you know

**Official websites use .mil**

A **.mil** website belongs to an official U.S. Department of Defense organization in the United States.

**Secure .mil websites use HTTPS**

A **lock (lock )** or **https://** means you’ve safely connected to the .mil website. The audit also identified that the DoD Financial Management Regulation did not require DoD Components to document the justification of payments that use supplemental funds for a specific purpose, such as documentation supporting the use of the Disaster Emergency Fund Code value. The DoD OIG also recommended a review of the supporting documentation for the questioned costs to determine whether the payments were accurate and supported the Ukraine assistance mission. 

The DoD OIG will continue to monitor the DoD’s implementation of the recommendations in this report.

Content: "<image:3835>](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Claim%20-%20Fact%20US%20Ukraine%20Support%202.0_0.png)

**US aid to Ukraine does not lack oversight nor has corruption in Ukraine diverted it.**

Claim: _US aid to Ukraine lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption in Ukraine._

Fact: US oversight is extensive, and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability is extensive and growing.

*   Critics point to a recent corruption case in which a small Ukrainian defense enterprise embezzled $40 million from public ammunition procurement funds, **without noting that the Ukrainian government caught the thieves and recovered the money.****\[1\]**
*   Ukraine has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts within its government and defense industrial base enterprises as part of efforts to increase domestic defense production.\[2\]
*   President Zelensky fired the previous defense minister after domestic corruption scandals unrelated to Western assistance emerged, and his replacement, the current minister, is aggressively rooting out corruption.\[3\] The Ukrainian government is also leveraging the robust and expansive Ukrainian NGO community to assist with its anti-corruption efforts.
*   Ukrainian and DoD personnel have been working aggressively to continue to improve monitoring and tracking of US aid, and US DoD officials have stated that there is no evidence that US-provided military assistance to Ukraine has been misappropriated.\[4\]
*   84% of the funds for Ukraine in the current proposed package would go to US companies, the US military, and other allied militaries, not Ukraine, which would get hardware and training from those funds.\[5\]
*   Western-provided weapons are being used as intended.  Mountains of evidence show advanced Western systems being used against Russian forces in Ukraine.\[6\]

**America’s NATO and Asian allies and other European states have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States.**

Claim: _The United States is giving more support to Ukraine than Europe, and Europe hasn’t stepped up._

Fact: America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine, which is more than the US will have committed counting the aid package currently under consideration.

*   The EU and its member states have made available $148.5 billion (138 billion euros) - including its recently announced support package of $54 billion (50 billion euros) - to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\[7\]
*   The United Kingdom has pledged $15.1 billion (£12 billion) in overall support to Ukraine since February 2022, of which $9 billion (£7.1 billion) is for military assistance.\[8\]
*   Canada has committed $1.8 billion (over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine since February 2022.\[9\] The Canadian military has also has trained approximately 40,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel since 2015, and Canada expanded and extended this program until March 2026.
*   Norway reached a multi-year agreement with Ukraine in February 2023 for a support program that will provide Ukraine with $7 billion (75 billion Norwegian kroner) between 2023 and 2027.\[10\] Norway pledged to allocate to Ukraine around $1.4 billion (15 billion Norwegian kroner) per year and had already provided around one billion dollars (10.7 billion Norwegian kroner) to Ukraine in 2022 and about $1.9 billion (19.9 billion Norwegian kroner) in 2023.
*   NATO member Turkey is building a new drone production facility and service center in Ukraine. Turkey’s leading drone maker, Baykar, announced in September 2023 that Turkey would open a drone production facility and service center for Bayraktar TB2 drones, which reportedly will become operational by early 2025.\[11\]
*   NATO member North Macedonia has sent 10 batches of military aid to Ukraine including Soviet-era military equipment as of November 2023.\[12\] North Macedonia is also training batches of Ukrainian military personnel and pledged to continue supporting Ukraine.\[13\]
*   South Korea is expanding its production of critical 155mm artillery shells to refill Western stockpiles and support the continued provision of ammunition in Ukraine.\[14\]
*   Japan pledged $4.5 billion to Ukraine in December 2023.\[15\] Japan also pledged an additional $37 million contribution to a NATO fund to provide additional support for Ukrainian defense in January 2024.\[16\]
*   Australia provided approximately $590 million (910 million Australian dollars) in overall military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as of late October 2023.\[17\]
*   New Zealand provided Ukraine with more than $48.7 million (80 million New Zealand dollars) in military and humanitarian assistance as of July 2023.\[18\]

**Ukraine is not a “forever war” for the United States because Americans are not fighting this war.**

Claim: _Ukraine is another 'forever war' for the United States._

Fact: This is not an American war.  It’s another nation’s war against an American enemy.

*   Ukrainians are fighting this war, not Americans.
*   The US is helping Ukraine fend off the Russian attack to reduce the risk that the US will have to fight Russia in the future. 
*   A Putin victory over Ukraine would embolden him and encourage him to test America’s willingness to defend its NATO allies, increasing the risk of a US-Russia war.\[19\]
*   Russian victory would also let Russian forces move closer to current NATO borders, forcing the US to commit more troops to the defense of its NATO allies.\[20\]
*   Ukraine is building up its own military and defense industry to be able to reduce its dependence on the US and will be able to do so if the US continues its support.\[21\]
*   Ukraine already has a significant defense industry and was one of the world’s leading weapons suppliers before the Russian invasions and is investing its own money and attracting foreign investors to dramatically increase this capability.\[22\]

**Sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness and reduces the risk that the United States will have to fight Russia itself.**

Claim: _Sending military aid to Ukraine degrades America's military readiness_.

Fact: Sending military aid to Ukraine has enabled the United States to modernize its own military to be better prepared to fight the next war.

*   The US is supporting Ukraine in part so that the US won’t have to fight Russia itself.
*   The overwhelming majority of military assistance is going to build up the US defense industrial base.\[23\]  It is allowing the expansion of current production lines of essential military supplies that the US military will need in any future war.
*   The equipment the US has been giving Ukraine is mostly old and sometimes inoperable.\[24\]  The US is purchasing new systems to replace what it gives Ukraine, modernizing the American military in the process.
*   American allies are also reinvigorating their defense industries and modernizing their militaries as consequences of support to Ukraine, which benefits the US.\[25\]

**The United States is not sending Ukraine a “blank check.”**

Claim: _The United States is/was sending Ukraine a "blank check."_

Fact: The United States has not given Ukraine a blank check. <image:3836>

Content: The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine. The audit determined whether the DoD used assistance funds in accordance with the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Acts and DoD policies. The audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half that total—$1.1 billion. The DoD OIG considers them questioned costs because, at the time of the audit, the purpose and the accuracy of the costs were not supported by adequate documentation. The DoD OIG made five recommendations to DoD management. The report is from 2025.

The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of US aid received by Ukraine. The evidence does mention that America's allies have committed more than $178 billion to support Ukraine.

The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine has extensive oversight and is not being misused due to corruption.

The claim is not verifiable due to the lack of information about Zelenskyy's statement regarding the amount of US aid received.


# Your Judgement

The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) and U.S. News & World Report ([Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy)) reported on an AP interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025. Zelenskyy discussed the war in Ukraine, potential talks between the U.S. and Russia, and the need for in-person meetings to develop more detailed agreements.

The AP also published an interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025 ([Source](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/)) <image:2120>, <image:2121>, <image:2122>, <image:2123>.

The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of US aid received by Ukraine. The evidence does mention that America's allies have committed more than $178 billion to support Ukraine.

The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine has extensive oversight and is not being misused due to corruption.

The claim is not verifiable due to the lack of information about Zelenskyy's statement regarding the amount of US aid received.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump \[AFP\]

By Jeff Cercone | PolitiFact

Published On 21 Feb 202521 Feb 2025

United States President Donald Trump has made a series of claims about Ukraine and its leader as he seeks to [end](/news/2025/2/20/us-switches-stance-on-ukraine-war-seeking-500bn-in-payback)
 the country’s three-year war with Russia.

Trump’s relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soured publicly as Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and said he “started” the war with Russia, a claim PolitiFact rated [pants-on-fire false](/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims)
. A search of Google and the Nexis news database found no reports of polls showing Zelenskyy with a 4 percent approval rating.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted February 4-9, Zelenskyy had a trust rating of 57 percent among 1,000 Ukrainians surveyed. Trump’s figure nearly doubles the amount that Congress has appropriated or made available since the war began.

Ukraine Oversight – the website of the special inspector general for Operation Atlantic Resolve, which the US government created in 2014 to coordinate its military aid to Ukraine – said that as of September 30, the US had spent $183bn to help Ukraine.

Mark Cancian, a senior defence and security adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the amount the US has spent varies depending on what is being counted as “aid to Ukraine” but most estimates are in the range of $175bn to $185bn.

“No matter what you add, however, the total doesn’t get close to $350bn,” Cancian said.

The numbers cited by Trump in terms of aid to Ukraine contradict data from the US government itself. The war of words has escalated after Zelenskyy accused Trump of repeating [Russian misinformation](/news/2025/2/20/trump-vs-zelenskyy-whats-behind-escalating-war-of-words)

Trump, who sent a team to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin negotiations on ending the war that did not include Ukraine, described Zelenskyy as a “modestly successful comedian” who was only good at playing former US President Joe Biden “like a fiddle”.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. “To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.”

Putin’s false rationalisations for the war were named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year in 2022.

Claim: Zelenskyy is a dictator
------------------------------

A professor who researches democracy and dictatorships said this is a mischaracterisation.

Zelenskyy was democratically elected in March 2019 to a five-year term with more than 73 percent of the vote. “Clearly, the term dictator does not apply to Zelenskyy, just as it does not apply to Churchill.”

A spokesperson for United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War II” and Zelenskyy is Ukraine’s “democratically elected leader”.

Putin won re-election to another six-year term in March in an election the US National Security Council said was “obviously not free nor fair”.

“Trump would be correct to use the term dictator to describe Putin, who has used fake elections to remain in power for a quarter of a century,” Moghaddam said.

Claim: Zelenskyy has a 4 percent approval rating
------------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. That poll, Ukrainska Pravda said, is tied to the former chief political strategist of Ukraine’s fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, who Zelenskyy beat in 2019.

Claim: The US has spent $350bn to help Ukraine
----------------------------------------------

This is inaccurate. The official amount spent by the US on Ukraine is $183bn.

Zelenskyy wasn’t saying that the rest of the money was missing. Of $175bn appropriated by Congress, much of it was spent in the US on weapons manufacturers and US military and government operations.

Claim: Zelenskyy was ‘sleeping and unavailable’ to meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week in Kyiv
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photos show this is inaccurate."

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has clarified that of the approximately US$177 billion in aid approved by the US for Ukraine, the country has received about US$76 billion.

**Source:** Zelenskyy in an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGq6VrLtqUc)
 with Associated Press

**Quote:** "When I hear – both in the past and even now – from the US that America has provided Ukraine with hundreds of billions \[of dollars\] (177, to be precise, based on what Congress approved), as the president of a nation at war, I can tell you – we’ve received more than US$75 billion.

So, when people talk about US$177 billion or even US$200 billion, we’ve never received that. Zelenskyy stated that US military aid to Ukraine [had not been halted](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/25/7495250/)
    .
*   US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a suspension of all new foreign aid payments during this review. The order suspends foreign aid programmes for 90 days to allow for an audit.
*   However, [military aid to Ukraine](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/23/7495024/)
     is exempt from this freeze and continues to be delivered under the policies established by the previous administration of Joe Biden.

 !Zelenskyy: Ukraine received US$76 billion out of US$177 billion approved by America <image:3378>

Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We’re talking about tangible things because this aid didn’t come as cash but rather as weapons, which amounted to about US$70 billion.

But when it’s said that Ukraine received US$200 billion to support the army during the war – that’s not true. Probably, these various organisations were funded by different foundations."

**Background:**

*   In November 2024, Zelenskyy stated that [Ukraine has not received](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/11/16/7484807/)
     even half of the weapons officially allocated by the United States and that Europe has helped Ukraine just as much as the US.  
*   On his first day as president, Donald Trump signed an executive order [suspending all foreign aid programmes](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2025/01/21/7202989/)
     for 90 days to assess their alignment with his political goals. Officials and NGO representatives in Ukraine warned that without Rubio’s authorisation, essential programs, including support for schools, hospitals and efforts to develop economic and energy infrastructure, could face significant setbacks.
*   On 26 January, The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Ukraine [was ordered to suspend all projects](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2025/02/2/7496431/)
     and expenditures following a directive from the US Department of State. It’s significant aid, but it’s not US$200 billion." 

**Details:** Regarding the suspension of funding for humanitarian programmes, Zelenskyy highlighted specific cases such as a US$200 million energy-related programme and others in healthcare and border security.

**Quote:** "Those US$300-400 million are the programmes the state received."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-trump-talks-ceasefire-00af5f61f1faf41e78a3b4e072c21a14)) and U.S. News & World Report ([Source](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-02-01/takeaways-from-the-ap-interview-with-ukraines-zelenskyy)) reported on an AP interview with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025. Zelenskyy discussed the war in Ukraine, potential talks between the U.S. and Russia, and the need for in-person meetings to develop more detailed agreements.

The AP also published an interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025 ([Source](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/second-winner/2025/ap-interview-zelenskyy-says-excluding-ukraine-from-u-s-russia-talks-about-war-is-very-dangerous/)) <image:2120>, <image:2121>, <image:2122>, <image:2123>.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. <image:3835> The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine has extensive oversight and is not being misused due to corruption.

The fact sheet also claims that the US is not sending Ukraine a "blank check." <image:3836> [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation. The AP interview with Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of US aid received by Ukraine. The evidence does mention that America's allies have committed more than $178 billion to support Ukraine.

The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine has extensive oversight and is not being misused due to corruption.

The claim is not verifiable due to the lack of information about Zelenskyy's statement regarding the amount of US aid received.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview that Ukraine has received only a portion of the US aid. Multiple sources, including Izvestia, Al Jazeera, and Pravda.com.ua, report on this statement. Zelenskyy mentioned receiving over $75 billion, while the US had earmarked $177 billion or $200 billion. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

The claim is partially supported. Zelenskyy's statement confirms that Ukraine has received only a portion of the US aid. However, the evidence does not directly confirm that the US aid is a money laundering operation.

In an interview with the Associated Press, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine has received only a portion of the US aid. Izvestia reports that Zelenskyy said Kiev had only received more than $75 billion from Washington, while Al Jazeera states that Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s military has received only a portion of the billions in US aid earmarked for Ukraine’s defense against Russia, citing a total of $177bn or $200bn spent by the US. Pravda.com.ua reports that Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine has received about US$76 billion of the approximately US$177 billion in aid approved by the US. <image:3374> <image:2124> <image:3378>


## Elaboration
Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview that Ukraine has received only a portion of the US aid. Multiple sources, including Izvestia, Al Jazeera, and Pravda.com.ua, report on this statement. Zelenskyy mentioned receiving over $75 billion, while the US had earmarked $177 billion or $200 billion. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

The claim is partially supported. Zelenskyy's statement confirms that Ukraine has received only a portion of the US aid. However, the evidence does not directly confirm that the US aid is a money laundering operation.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported. Zelenskyy did state in an AP interview that Ukraine had received only a portion of the US aid. However, the evidence does not directly confirm that the US aid is a money laundering operation. The DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While Zelenskyy stated in an AP interview that Ukraine had received only a portion of the US aid, the evidence does not directly confirm that the US aid is a money laundering operation. The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion.

Multiple tweets, posted between November 12-15, 2022, claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars sourced from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party.

 and [Jack Posobiec](https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1591855516053303298)

It added that of the $60 million received through Aid For Ukraine, $54 million had been spent on "Ukraine's humanitarian and military needs." Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister Fedorov Mykhailo made the same claim on Twitter, and included what he said was a [breakdown of this spending.](https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1559923193581899777)

Everstake added that the funds received were not stored on FTX and could be "converted into fiat elsewhere if necessary."

Its CEO Sergey Vasylchuk [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/everstake_pool/status/1592622417226366977)
 as well, alleging that the claim was part of a Russian disinformation effort.

"Every time Russia is defeated on the battlefield, it starts looking for another way to cover up its military failures in the media by spreading fake news based on made-up assumptions," Vasylchuk said.

"This time, they decided to use the FTX collapse to spin yet another tale about money laundering. aid misappropriated?
-----------------------------

The claim that funds were effectively "laundered" from Ukraine via FTX back into the U.S., less so to the Democratic party coffers or Biden himself, is unevidenced.

_Newsweek_ has investigated the coverage of this claim across social media and larger media outlets and could find no transaction ID, statements, or any other tangible evidence to support the idea that U.S. government funding—under the nose of a multi-million dollar oversight process coordinated between the Office of Inspector General, the DOD and USAID—it would require a major lapse in oversight from those auditing Ukraine and a breakdown of protections in place to ensure funds could not be re-appropriated.

Furthermore, funding for Ukraine [received bipartisan support](https://www.newsweek.com/these-69-house-reps-voted-against-providing-ukraine-aid-1686658)
, meaning that both Democrats and Republicans signed off on the terms of the funding and how it would be managed.

In response to these claims Alex Bornyakov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine on IT industry development [tweeted:](https://twitter.com/abornyakov/status/1592241279051743233)
 "A fundraising crypto foundation [@\_AidForUkraine](https://twitter.com/_AidForUkraine)

Did FTX send Ukrainian crypto donations to the U.S.?
----------------------------------------------------

FTX has also played a role in providing Ukraine with the capability to receive cryptocurrency donations since Russia's invasion.

In [March 2022](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/14/ukraine-partners-with-ftx-everstake-to-launch-new-crypto-donation-website/)
, the Ukrainian government launched a crypto donations website, Aid for Ukraine, with the backing of FTX, to route donated crypto to the National Bank of Ukraine. According [to its website](https://aid-for-ukraine.io/)
, Aid for Ukraine has received more than $60 million in donations including [611 Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/357a3So9CbsNfBBgFYACGvxxS6tMaDoa1P)

, and 15,048,821 USDT (which is at least on paper supposed to be pegged to the U.S. foreign aid receives to ensure that it is spent appropriately on measures relating to Ukrainian assistance.

For example, under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act 2022, the bill behind the $40 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine, $5 million was spent on oversight of the funds alone, including by the Department of State Inspector General and the USAID Inspector General.

The Office of Inspector General Oversight in the Department of Defence (DOD OIG) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID OIG) both provide audits of the use of funding in Ukraine and investigate complaints and allegations of misuse or attempted misuse of [USAID funding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Office%20of%20Investigations%20Ukraine%20Briefing%20Sheet%20-%20Oct%2022.pdf)

CLAIM: U.S. The company filed for bankruptcy protection amid news it was short billions of dollars and may have been hacked.

The move has fueled baseless conspiracy theories on social media around the embattled former CEO’s donations, FTX, and Democrats who ran in this year’s midterm elections.

“So Biden gave loads of money to Ukraine, who gave loads of money to FTX, who gave loads of money to Democrats,” reads one tweet with over 100,000 likes.

“For an entire year Democrat law makers have stood on the House floor and demanded taxpayer $$ for Ukraine. The ministry said it “provided informational support” to the foundation, which was run by the cryptocurrency exchange Kuna and the blockchain company Everstake.

In early March, Aid For Ukraine began working with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022, according to the ministry.

Sergey Vasylchuk, the CEO of Everstake, told the AP that cryptocurrencies were an efficient way to raise funds for Ukraine to defend itself amid Russia’s invasion. The donations would then get sent to the [National Bank of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/NBUkraine/status/1502207218514604034)
 and no crypto was stored on FTX.

“It was eight months ago and the goal was that Aid for Ukraine was to supply the needs as soon as possible,” Vasylchuk said when asked about the relationship between Aid for Ukraine and FTX. FTX’s co-CEO [Ryan Salame](https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Ryan+Salame&two_year_transaction_period=2022&min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&max_date=12%2F31%2F2022)
 also donated to groups that supported Republican candidates in 2022, including the Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund and American Dream Federal Action, which he [founded](https://americandreamaction.com/adfa-founder-pandemic-prevention-one-of-best-things-we-can-do-for-future-generations/)
.

White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said any claim that U.S. officials [announced](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-congress-government-and-politics-f72e45a5229fa311819b83dcbb2e5216)
 earlier this month the country will send $400 million more in military aid to Ukraine, including funding for ammunition and air defense systems."

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden responded to Hurricane Helene. Le Monde reported that Biden pledged to aid victims. France 24 reported on Biden's defense of the government's response. The BBC article mentions misinformation about the government's response.

The evidence does not contain information about Biden announcing that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene, nor does it mention any aid for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joe Biden responded to Hurricane Helene. Le Monde reported that Biden pledged to aid victims. France 24 reported on Biden's defense of the government's response. The BBC article mentions misinformation about the government's response.

The evidence does not contain information about Biden announcing that no more aid would be provided for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene, nor does it mention any aid for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The available evidence, including reports from the BBC, Le Monde, and France 24, indicates that President Biden responded to Hurricane Helene by visiting affected areas and pledging aid. However, none of the sources support the claim that Biden announced a cessation of aid for hurricane relief or the allocation of funds to Ukraine. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

Posts shared on Facebook allege that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States “because of Trump supporters.” Though intended as satire, several users seem to have taken this seriously.

Examples of posts making this claim can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire2/posts/3020933381475578)
; , [here](https://www.facebook.com/art.jones.5/posts/3303647453036654)
 and [here](https://www.facebook.com/janyerdominguez/posts/10222928231691306)
 .

Kaepernick last played in the NFL in 2016, the year when he sparked national controversy for taking a knee during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality and police brutality in the United States. You are good for nothing!”

The post on  “America – Love It Or Leave It” includes a link to a Daily World Update article ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 ) with the headline “Colin Kaepernick Threatens To Leave America Because of Trump Supporters.” As stated in the website’s “About” section ( [dailyworldupdate.us/about/](https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/)
 ), “DailyWorldUpdate.us is a subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” It notes that “everything on this website is fiction. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.”

Text in the article itself ( [here](https://dailyworldupdate.us/colin-kaepernick-threatens-to-leave-america-because-of-trump-supporters/?fbclid=IwAR08AjXhxrjWZP2aHoDuhaORlUQrQkRXYuukngmkTvcAK3-GS2FmUXRLYbE)
 )  also suggests that the story is satirical. The claim that Colin Kaepernick has threatened to leave the United States because of Trump supporters originated in a clearly satirical article on the website DailyWorldUpdate.us.

This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team. Some fans praised Kaepernick and other players joined him in the protest, but his action was criticized by President Donald as unpatriotic.

The posts making the claim were posted on Oct. For example, it quotes a Kaepernick spokesman as saying that the former NFL player “loves America and would never think about leaving,” then adds, “not to mention no other country will have Americans because Trump screwed up so much that the world thinks we’re walking infection machines.”

VERDICT

Satire."

*   Russia's online disinformation campaign extended well beyond 2016 and focused heavily on the NFL kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to stoke racial tensions, according to a new Senate report.

    , and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
    , but the new report builds on the extent to which this occurred. 
*   The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy continued as late as March 2018, and the trolls zeroed in on Colin Kaepernick at one point.

Russia's 2016 disinformation campaign sought to leverage the NFL national anthem kneeling controversy as part of a broader effort to divide the US and inflame racial divisions, according to [the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf)
 on Russian election interference, which was released on Tuesday.

The report said that the focus on the NFL kneeling controversy went well beyond 2016 and continued as late as March 2018. 

It's been previously reported that Russian trolls [continued efforts to divide the US after Election Day 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-knowledge-oxford-reports-russia-disinformation-campaign-senate-intelligence-committee-2018-12)
, and that [the NFL has been a big target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-russian-trolls-inflamed-nfls-anthem-controversy-1540233979)
, but the second volume of the Senate Intelligence Committee report builds on the extent to which race and the national anthem kneeling debate were part of the disinformation campaign. 

"The Committee found that no single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African-Americans," the report said. "By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016."

_

The Internet Research Agency, the notorious Russian troll farm at the center of these efforts, "heavily focused on hotbutton issues with racial undertones, such as the NFL kneeling protests."

This included references to Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who garnered national attention for kneeling during the national anthem and was ostracized by the league as a result. 

"A Left Troll account, @wokeluisa, tweeted in support of Colin Kaepernick and tje NFL protests on March 13, 2018, prompting 37,000 forwarded retweets," the report said. "Simultaneous to this, and in .the direction of the ideologically opposite audience, @BarbaraForTrump, a Right Troll account, was tweeting content hostile to the protests."

The Senate Intelligence Committee "found that IRA activity on social media did not cease, but rather increased after Election Day 2016."

Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election has been among the most divisive topics in Washington since the last presidential election. An assessment from US intelligence agencies found that Russia [interfered in the election under the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14Q1T8)
 with the intention of boosting [Donald Trump's](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4)
 chances of winning by maligning former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 

Despite the intelligence community's findings and [continued warnings about the Kremlin's ongoing efforts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-officials-warn-of-pervasive-russian-efforts-to-disrupt-2018-elections-1533235652)
 to intervene in the US electoral process, Trump has expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and downplayed the issue at times. 

Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who conducted an extensive investigation on Russia's efforts and issued a 448-page report on this, concluded that Russia [sought to help Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/24/two-big-mueller-exchanges-that-capture-russia-scandal/)
 and that there ["were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election."](https://twitter.com/CNNPolitics/status/1133756208584822786)

Mueller did not, however, find sufficient evident that the Trump campaign "conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Though the former special counsel declined to reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice in the process of the inquiry, he also did not exonerate the president on the matter and outlined [11 possible instances of obstruction](https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-mueller-report-10-instances-obstruction-of-justice-press-conference-2019-4)

Since 2016, the eyes of the world have been on Colin Kaepernick. Pro-Trump accounts on Twitter helped to drive the campaign to boycott Nike once it named Kaepernick as the face of its Just Do It advertising campaign, new analysis shows.

Twitter activity around the protests also shows accounts believed to be linked to Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign helped to amplify the anti-Nike sentiment. This was followed by #nike, #colinkaepernick, #boycottnike, #kaepernick and #dumpnikestock, which all had more than 1,000 uses. A limited number of tweets led to [widespread](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/colin-kaepernick-nike-campaign-social-media-reaction)
 press coverage of protests.

The attempted boycott has worked out well for Nike. Mark Parker, the company's chief executive, said that customers responded "quite strongly" to the Kaepernick advertisement.

"Like many campaigns, it's driving a real uptick in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially," Parker was reported as saying by the [_BBC_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45643845)
.

Graphika says Russian Twitter accounts targeted the Nike boycott but did not create it. [_CNN_ has previously reported](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/08/technology/nfl-national-anthem-russia-trolls/index.html)
 on Russian links to online criticism of Kaepernick.

"Our understanding of how the Russians work – not just in the American political environment but in Europe and elsewhere – is they embed these sock puppet assets into the natural political landscape of the country they are trying to influence," Kelly says. Graphika says the online movement spread, this group grew from 18 per cent of hashtag uses to 21 per cent and largely was reacting to the pro-Trump group.

Data from analysts at [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-nike-colin-kaepernick-just-do-it-ad/)
 found that from September 2 to September 4 mentions of "Just Do It" increased by more than 3,460 per cent and Nike's overall online sentiment dropped after it released the ad. As the national anthem played, Kaepernick [remained sitting on the bench](https://www.prweek.com/article/1407098/nfl-49ers-tread-sensitive-line-kaepernick-controversy)
 in protest at the oppression of black people in the US.

The protest was the first of many, with Kaepernick and other players subsequently taking the knee. The first scan, conducted within hours after Nike named Kaepernick as the face of its new advert on September 3, found around 7,000 to 8,000 accounts using the initial hashtags calling for a boycott of Nike.

Kelly says that around 12-18 hours later when the second scan was conducted there were more than 80,000 different Twitter accounts that had posted messages with the hashtags."

Netanyahu’s Visit to the White House Highlights Critical Foreign Policy Issues
==============================================================================

! President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.
*   There have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as both countries battle for influence in Syria, although Trump suggested that he could serve as a mediator to help the two leaders move beyond their differences.
*   Hamas has been seriously degraded as a military force in Gaza but has not been destroyed, as Netanyahu promised in the opening weeks of Israel’s military campaign.
*   Trump also revealed during the White House meeting that the U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the leaders discussed a range of issues, including Trump’s tariffs, negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, and Türkiye-Israel relations, especially as tensions have escalated over each country’s role in a post-Assad Syria.** It was Netanyahu’s [second visit](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2025-february-5/)
 to Washington D.C. Netanyahu is buoyed by his recent meeting with [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2022-april-7/)
, who welcomed Netanyahu and announced that Budapest would be withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has sought indictments for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for their role in Israel’s war in Gaza. <image:2171>

**Bottom Line Up Front**

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. was engaged in “direct talks” with Iran over its nuclear program, although it is unclear whether key obstacles – such as Iranian support for its proxies or its ballistic missile program – will prove insurmountable.

**Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited U.S. Abroad, Israel has acted with free rein in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, emboldened both politically and militarily. However, there have been some questions about how Netanyahu will deal with [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-erdogan-seeks-bigger-role-for-turkey-on-world-stage-but-at-what-cost/)
 as both countries battle for influence in Syria. On trade, tariffs levied against Israel remained at 17 percent, with no progress on that front during the meeting, even as Netanyahu promised to eliminate Israel’s trade deficit with the United States and dismantle existing trade barriers.

On Gaza, where Israel restarted its military offensive against Hamas three weeks ago, Netanyahu received no pressure or pushback from the Trump administration. While some would suggest that the Biden administration gave Netanyahu a blank check on dealing with Gaza, there were the occasional lectures on human rights and warnings about mounting civilian casualties."

 four issues – March 5, 12, 19, and 26 – with covers that were entirely different from the image circulating on Facebook. The photo circulated on Facebook features a serial number of the issue – 1705, which [matches](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1705/)
 the actual issue published on March 26.

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/domenico.farina.31/posts/10223728579482001)
 claims to show a Charlie Hebdo magazine cover of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence that this image was created by the magazine. **[(RELATED: Is Elon Musk Paying The Salaries Of The Rescued Astronauts For A ‘Full Year?’)](https://checkyourfact.com/2025/03/24/fact-check-musk-paying-salaries-rescued-astronauts-full-year/)

“The political corpse emits its last gas’: a new illustration by the French political magazine Charlie Hebdo. Check Your Fact reviewed Charlie Hebdo’s magazine covers, such as the March 19 [cover](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/1704/)
. No such cover shows Zelenskyy in a coffin. ‘Ukraine is independent’, says Zelensky from his coffin in the illustration,” reads one user’s post.

This claim is false."

Pro-Russian actors routinely spread fake Charlie Hebdo editions online to discredit Ukraine and weaken the West's support for Kyiv.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An alleged front cover from the French satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo is circulating online, mocking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis.

In the picture, we can see a caricature of Zelenskyy holding up the body of the late pontiff at the Vatican bank. Please transfer all of my money to Ukraine," the cartoon Zelenskyy says.

The accounts sharing the front cover and commenting on it are critical of Zelenskyy, accusing him of demanding money from world governments and using Ukraine's defence against Russia's war as a pretext.

It's a common accusation that critics of Ukraine try to levy against the Ukrainian president in an effort to weaken support for Kyiv.

But this is all false: firstly, we can easily check whether the picture is authentic by visiting [**Charlie Hebdo's website**](https://charliehebdo.fr/editions/)
 — it's not anywhere to be found.

It was supposedly published on 23 April 2025, but checking Charlie Hebdo's list of recent publications shows us that the real 23 April edition looks completely different.

The edition number is also wrong: the real cover shows the number 1709, while the fake one is labelled 1710.

The real edition does deal with the pope's death, but instead mockingly says his successor will be "truly close to the poor" by depicting him as a rat.

The rat says: "What's more, I'm reactionary, misogynistic and homophobic."

Many of the accounts sharing the fake front cover online are pro-Russian and regular disseminators of Kremlin propaganda that attempt to discredit Ukraine.

Charlie Hebdo itself has previously [**issued a warning**](https://charliehebdo.fr/2022/09/societe/des-russes-font-des-fausses-unes-charlie/)
 that pro-Russian actors are using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

"Russian propagandists are creating fake Charlie Hebdo front pages to make it appear that the newspaper supports Putin," the magazine said.

 of false Charlie Hebdo editions that disparage Zelenskyy. In this one, Zelenskyy was depicted as Quasimodo, a character from Victor Hugo's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", again as part of an effort to demean him and wider Ukraine by extension.

It's been widely shown that Russia is attempting to damage support for Ukraine by spreading propaganda that depicts Zelenskyy as a money-grabbing opportunist who's robbing taxpayers' funds.

This particular fake Charlie Hebdo front cover is especially striking because it combines two figures who have constantly fallen victim to deepfakes over the past few years: Zelenskyy and Pope Francis.

The former has become a prime target for misinformation in general ever since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Such false narratives, such as accusing him of prolonging the war and calling his motives for financial assistance into question, are amplified when even high-profile politicians worldwide, such as US President Donald Trump, [**have labelled him a "dictator"**](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/21/fact-check-what-is-the-truth-behind-trumps-claims-on-ukraine)
.

However, Western countries are providing legitimate financial and humanitarian support to Kyiv, and surveys [**consistently show**](https://www.statista.com/chart/34068/public-support-for-ukraine-aid-in-europe/)
 that a strong majority of European citizens back this.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Euronews published an article on May 6, 2025, discussing a fake Charlie Hebdo cover that mocks Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the death of Pope Francis. The article states that pro-Russian actors are spreading fake Charlie Hebdo editions online to discredit Ukraine and weaken Western support for Kyiv. The fake cover, which was supposedly published on April 23, 2025, depicts Zelenskyy holding the body of the late Pope Francis. The article provides evidence that the cover is fake by comparing it to the real Charlie Hebdo publications. The article also mentions that Charlie Hebdo has previously warned about pro-Russian actors using its image to produce anti-Ukraine content.

Trump’s explosive clash with Zelenskyy: read the full transcript
================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

Meeting between US and Ukraine presidents descends into chaos at White House – here’s what they said, word for word

A meeting between [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
 veered sharply off track in front of the television cameras as the US president [berated his Ukrainian counterpart](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
 then abruptly called off a minerals deal with that he had said would be the first step towards a ceasefire with Russia.

Here are the highlights, word-for-word, of the conversation between Trump, Zelenskyy and Vice-President [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance)
 in the Oval Office.

**Zelenskyy**: What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you are asking about? I will say that.

**Trump, raising his voice**: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good and very strong.

_Zelenskyy tries to_ _speak._

**Trump**: You right now are not in a very good position. With us, you start having the cards.

You’re gambling with lives of millions of people, you’re gambling with world war three and what you’re doing is very disrespectful to this country.

**Vance**: Have you said thank you once?

**Zelenskyy**: A lot of times.

**Vance**: No, in this meeting, this entire meeting? Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, you think that if you will speak very loudly about the war …

**Trump**: He’s not speaking loud. Your country is in big trouble.

**Zelenskyy**: I know, I know.

**Trump**: You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK, because of us.

**Zelenskyy**: We are staying strong from the very beginning of the war, we have been alone, and we are saying, I said, thanks.

**Trump, speaking over Zelenskyy**: You haven’t been alone … We gave you military equipment. If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.

**Zelenskyy**: I heard it from Putin in three days.

**Trump**: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this.

**Vance**: Just say thank you.

**Zelenskyy**: I said it a lot of times.

**Vance**: Accept that there are disagreements and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it in the American media, when you’re wrong. What do you mean?

**Vance**: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.

**Zelenskyy**: Yes, but if you …

**Vance**: Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media."

US suspends all military aid to Ukraine in wake of Trump-Zelenskyy row
======================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

Decision affects ammunition, vehicles and other equipment including weapons in transit

*   [Europe live – latest updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/04/europe-live-news-us-military-aid-ukraine-peace-talks-russia)
    

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)
 has suspended delivery of all US military aid to Ukraine, blocking billions in crucial shipments, as the White House piles pressure on Kyiv to sue for peace with Vladimir Putin.

The decision affects deliveries of ammunition, vehicles and other equipment, including shipments agreed to when Joe Biden was president.

It comes after a dramatic blow-up in the White House on Friday during which Donald Trump, infuriated over what he claimed was the Ukrainian leader’s disrespect and ingratitude, told Volodymyr Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war)
” a third world war. Brendan Boyle​, a congressman in Pennsylvania who is a co-chair of the congressional EU caucus, ​said it was ​“reckless, indefensible and a direct threat to our national security”​.

Earlier on Monday, Trump had expressed fresh outrage at Zelenskyy for saying the end of the war could be “very, very far away”.

Trump posted a link to an [Associated Press story](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskyy-starmer-trump-b025877c40ffe0ddf2a92adad1715231)
 outlining Zelenskyy’s comments and said: “This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!

“It is what I was saying, this guy doesn’t want there to be peace as long as he has America’s backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US. What are they thinking?”

Later on Monday, Trump said Zelenskyy “won’t be around very long” unless he succumbed to pressure and made a deal on US terms.

The Trump administration was also reported to be [drawing up a plan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/trump-sanctions-russia)
 on Monday to restore ties with Russia and lift sanctions on the Kremlin.

The White House has asked the state and treasury departments to draft a list of sanctions that could be eased for US officials to discuss with Russian representatives in the coming days as part of the [administration’s broad talks with Moscow](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/28/russia-appoint-us-ambassador-diplomatic-relations-thaw)
 on improving diplomatic and economic relations, Reuters reported, citing a US official and another person familiar with the matter.

'Some random country': Vance appears to insult UK and France with Ukrainian taunt – video

In an interview recorded on Monday before the announcement of the suspension, Vance told the Fox News channel’s Hannity that giving the US an economic interest in the future of Ukraine would serve as a security guarantee – a reference to the minerals deal about which Zelenskyy had been summoned to Washington.

“If you want real security guarantees, if you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine,” Vance said.

----------- Zelenskyy was told to come back “when he is ready for peace”.

Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said on Tuesday that Kyiv still had the means to supply its frontline forces but warned thousands of lives were at risk and vital US-provided air defence systems could be affected.

“We will continue to work with the US through all available channels in a calm manner,” Shmyhal told a press conference. The Ramstein group is an alliance of 57 countries that has coordinated aid to Ukraine during the war.

The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, [announced proposals on Tuesday](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine)
 to strengthen Europe’s defence industry and increase military capabilities by mobilising close to €800bn (£661bn). The EU is holding an emergency summit on Thursday.

The White House’s decision followed a meeting that included Hegseth and the vice-president, JD Vance, along with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.

Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said Trump appeared to be pushing Ukraine towards capitulation. It looks like he is pushing us towards capitulation, meaning \[accepting\] Russia’s demands.”

Razom for Ukraine, a Ukrainian advocacy group, said: “By abruptly halting military assistance to Ukraine, President Trump is hanging Ukrainians out to dry and giving Russia the green light to continue marching west. In December, shortly before leaving office, Biden announced an additional $5.9bn in security and budget assistance.

US assistance to Ukraine includes military aid, budgetary assistance largely delivered through a World Bank trust fund, and other funds that had been delivered through the US Agency for International Development, which has been throttled by the Trump White House.

Some of the money sent by the US to Ukraine helps the country pay the salaries of teachers and doctors, and keeps the government running.

Weapons assistance from the US has been facilitated through two programmes: presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows the president to quickly transfer weapons and equipment from US stocks to foreign countries without the need for congressional approval; and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), under which military equipment is procured from the defence industry.

[Graphic shows US and European aid to Ukraine as a share of GDP and in absolute terms](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/03/ukraine_aid_ranking/giv-45591KDfLrAi6j0o)

In total, the US has pledged $31.7bn of weapons aid to Ukraine through PDA. Razom for Ukraine urges the White House to immediately reverse course, resume military aid and pressure Putin to end his horrific invasion.”

The US Congress has approved $175bn (£138bn) in total assistance for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion nearly three years ago, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump has not approved any new aid under his own presidential authority since taking office and a new congressional aid package appears unlikely, at least in the near term.

The scandal came to light when a [whistleblower](/wiki/Whistleblower "Whistleblower")

 in July 2019 to investigate [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")

 Trump acknowledged he had told Zelenskyy "we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son \[contributing\] to the corruption already in the Ukraine."[\[25\]](#cite_note-trump_acknowledges-25)
 According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President [Mike Pence](/wiki/Mike_Pence "Mike Pence")
, and Trump withholding $400 million in military aid from Ukraine.[\[26\]](#cite_note-Balsamo-190926-26)

 Giuliani said the investigations he sought would be beneficial to President Trump, his client, and that his efforts had Trump's full support.[\[91\]](#cite_note-plans_trip-91)
 Giuliani's efforts began as an attempt to provide cover for Trump to pardon Manafort, who had been [convicted of eight felony counts](/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort "Trials of Paul Manafort")

[\[94\]](#cite_note-WaPo_How_Trump_pressured-94)

 Giuliani asserted he cancelled the trip because he had been "set up" by Ukrainians who objected to his efforts, and blamed Democrats for trying to "spin" the trip. On this call, Giuliani said that if Zelenskyy were to publicly announce an investigation into Biden, it would help Zelenskyy have "a much better relationship" with Trump.[\[98\]](#cite_note-new_audio-98)

CNN  — 

President Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated [Oval Office argument](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/01/politics/inside-trump-zelensky-meeting/index.html)
 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday.

The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a [series of meetings](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-zelensky-national-security-meetings/index.html)
 with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraine’s war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.

“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” the White House official said.

After more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Monday’s pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office.

In recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putin’s hand.

The pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelensky’s bad behavior last week.

Ukraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks — perhaps until the start of the summer — before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. “Their front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse – even catastrophic – peace settlement.”

But Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces.

, which had been close to agreement before Friday’s meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday [in an interview on CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/politics/rubio-zelensky-apology-trump-cnntv/index.html)
.

The halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States’ traditional [European allies](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/europe/ukraine-russia-zelensky-starmer-summit-intl/index.html)
 like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday.

“There is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone,” one US official said.

A European official called the Trump administration’s decision to pause military aid to Ukraine “petty and wrong.”

The official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles.

“I’m beyond disappointed,” the official told CNN

Since the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes “so far,” saying, “the American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and there’s no end in sight.”

“I don’t believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, ‘Let’s bring an end to it,’” the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, “then we will.”

However, he warned if Zelensky “doesn’t want to negotiate peace, then it’s not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war.”

GOP Sen. Brian Mast told CNN he “knew it was an option” for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine.

“I think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now,” he said.

Initially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties,[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
 as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)
[\[20\]](#cite_note-23)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-24)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-25)
 Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties.[\[19\]](#cite_note-hides-22)

 stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete,[\[23\]](#cite_note-26)
 with 4,638 deaths (4,500 identified and 138 unidentified) cataloged by 1 December 2021.[\[10\]](#cite_note-memory0-11)

, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021.[\[24\]](#cite_note-27)
 Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.[\[25\]](#cite_note-28)

Faced with mounting losses in Ukraine, the Russian authorities moved quickly to decide how the deaths of soldiers would be reported. **Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona,_ in collaboration with _BBC News_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, maintains a named list of deceased Russian military personnel. Here we report what we’ve learned about the losses during this time and the events at the front that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part showcases visual representations of losses since the beginning of the war: for example, where the deceased served or in which regions they lived. These are absolute numbers, not adjusted for population or number of military units.

On the map, you can choose between total losses and losses by military branch, as well as see where the deceased mobilised soldiers were from.

In most cases, from death reports or indirect signs (uniform or sleeve patches in photos), it’s possible to determine which branch of the military the deceased served in, or how they joined the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.)

We compared these groups of servicemen on a separate graph.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. The children are too young to understand what the plaques mean, but they walk past them all the same.

What we know about losses
-------------------------

Here’s how the losses are distributed across Russian regions. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, reports of the deaths of two deputy army commanders have been officially confirmed—Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky of the 41st Army and Major General Vladimir Frolov of the 8th Army.

On May 22, 2022, fighter pilot, 63-year-old retired Major General Kanamat Botashev died; most likely, he went to war as a volunteer. This list is not exhaustive, as not every military death becomes public knowledge.

To provide a more comprehensive picture of the war’s impact, we offer a second figure: an estimate of excess mortality among men, based on Probate registry data. This method was developed in collaboration with _Meduza_, to address the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is not accurate. The Russia Matters article from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian soldiers killed or injured, with 48,000 missing. A Wikipedia article from July 2024 mentions a British Army official estimating 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. However, the claim states 1.5 million *lost* troops, which is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence provides figures for killed, injured, missing, and captured soldiers, but not a total loss figure that matches the claim.

The evidence also provides different estimates from various sources, including Meduza and Mediazona, which further complicates the verification of the claim. The Meduza estimate of over 165,000 deaths by the end of 2024 and the Mediazona data up to December 2024 do not align with the 1.5 million figure.

Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence provides estimates for casualties, but not a specific figure for total troop losses that matches the claim.

False video claims Hollywood stars were paid by USAID to visit Ukraine

A video claiming that USAID, the US government's main overseas aid agency, has paid Hollywood celebrities millions of dollars to visit Ukraine has gone viral on social media and has been amplified by high-profile accounts like Elon Musk.

However, the clip is not real and has hallmarks of a Russian disinformation operation that the BBC has previously investigated.

BBC Verify's Olga Robinson explains why.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several sources debunk a video alleging that USAID paid Hollywood celebrities to visit Ukraine. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m12wl0jwpo)) and The Hollywood Reporter ([https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/fake-online-usaid-paid-hollywood-stars-debunked-1236129713/)) identified the video as Russian disinformation. The video falsely claimed USAID paid Angelina Jolie, Sean Penn, Jean Claude Van Damme, Orlando Bloom, and Ben Stiller.

Ben Stiller denied the claims, stating he self-funded his trip, as confirmed by Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/ben-stiller-denies-elon-musks-retweet-claiming-usaid-funded-the-stars-trip-to-ukraine?srsltid=AfmBOooGw1dpqnug2OYCP6ztL_oyb-nbLtgTwlK9XIbCoPDkIdmO6uAz)).

 appears to feature an audio recording of US President Donald Trump criticising the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over aid to Ukraine, energy costs and jobs.

But the audio has been generated by AI and overlaid onto a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC5cHjcgt5g)
 Mr Trump did with podcaster Theo Von on 21 August 2024.

Neither Mr Trump or Mr Von discuss the UK or Ukraine in this video, but instead focus on US healthcare reform, border security and President Trump’s reasons for avoiding drinking and smoking.

**How did we know this was AI-generated?**

We contacted Professor **Hany Farid**, who specialises in digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is Chief Science Officer at GetReal Labs, a cybersecurity company focused on preventing malicious threats from generative AI.

He told us this is “an obvious—and not particularly well-executed—fake”...

Trump said he looked up to and admired his brother, who died in 1981, calling him an "incredible personality." He added that he's heard alcohol is "tougher to get off of than drugs," to which Von said that he himself is in recovery from drug and alcohol use.

The former president discussed a variety of other topics during the episode, including his relationship with his family, health care, lobbying, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and the 2024 presidential election.

**2024 Presidential Election:** [Donald Trump (pretty much) sticks to the script on Harris. Von said, "No, it's horrible, but you do it anyway, just like the guy you're saying with the scotch," referring to an earlier conversation about alcohol.

Trump asked Von which substance he thought was a bigger problem in the U.S.: alcohol or opioids, to which Von responded opioids.

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

[!Russian navy recruits perform with the Russian flag in St. <image:2336>](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia."

### LA fires are still raging, but forecasters expect calmer winds in the coming days

[It was another day of fierce winds gusting to 65 mph in mountainous areas of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, but weather more conducive to firefighting operations is expected soon.](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5260939/fires-los-angeles-palisades-eaton-wildfires-winds)

"It is the latest in a long string of assertions by Russian officials, media, and the pro-Kremlin online ecosystem that Ukrainian officials are corrupt and use foreign aid money to enrich themselves." Léa Ronzaud, a senior investigator at research firm Graphika, told NPR in an email.

### This is what Russian propaganda looks like in 2024

[The hallmarks of Russian-back influence are consistent: trying to erode support for Ukraine, discrediting democratic institutions and seizing on existing political divides.](https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/g-s1-2965/russia-propaganda-deepfakes-sham-websites-social-media-ukraine)

"It's just so typical of what we see from Russia, \[to\] take advantage of an ongoing crisis for their own ends," said Darren Linvill, a communications professor and co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub.

The Ukrainian general story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel four days after the fires started in Los Angeles. Some of the posts amplifying the baseless claim falsely credited it to United24 Media, a website affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation issued a [statement](https://x.com/CforCD/status/1878381491056501245)
 describing the claim as "Russian propaganda." It said it had verified with United24 Media that it did not create or share the story.

NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. 

**Transcript:**

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

And now to California, where firefighters in Los Angeles are making progress getting those massive wildfires under control. Both @OlgaBazova and Patterson's posts received user-generated community notes on X citing the Greek fact check.

The unverified claim about the alleged Ukrainian-owned mansions also appeared on other social media platforms including Tik Tok, TruthSocial and the Russian site VK, but did not gain much traction.

The story is the latest example of Russia's shift away from using fake social media profiles impersonating real people, as it did during the 2016 and 2020 U.S. Accounts tied to previous China influence operations spread false claims about the fire's origins.

While the story about Ukrainian officials got more traction than the other narratives about the fires originating from Russia-allied channels, Linvill said, it has not yet spread as widely as previous narratives linked to Russia. So this particular narrative, what it alleges is that mansions of eight Ukrainian generals were amongst the homes destroyed."

!Briefing Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Armed Forces Of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi <image:2342>

General Valerii Zaluzhnyi was among those reported to have a home in Los Angeles, even though he lives in London now as Ukraine's ambassador to the UK. The Russian propaganda effort is thus to encourage support for the war at home while making those in the West question any aid that has been sent to Kyiv.

"People predisposed to believing narratives like this will take it to be another 'false' datapoint of corruption and largesse in the Ukrainian military, and at the same time, a sweet act of karma that these imaginary mansions are burning to the ground," said Schmidt. The total value of these properties amounts to $90 million and was allegedly purchased with funds provided by the West as part of economic aid to Kyiv after the war began."

Subsequent posts [named Valerii Zaluzhnyi](https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501 "https://t.me/naspravdiinfo/104501")
, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as being among those who have lost their homes.

Satire, But Really Disinformation
---------------------------------

The initial post on Telegram did indeed include the hashtag "сатира" (Russian for satire), but subsequent reposts lacked any mention that it was made in jest. Yet, even as "satire," it isn't clear where the humor lies in the original post, except possibly to Russian audiences who might find joy that any Ukrainian would see their home burns down in the devastating California fires.

"There is zero evidence that any Ukrainian generals own any property in L.A., much less mansions," said Dr. It's not just about the misinformation – it's about how quickly it crosses platforms and gains traction."

Disinformation Fits An Existing Narrative
-----------------------------------------

All of these disinformation campaigns have a common thread – they're based on the unsubstantiated belief that Ukrainian officials are getting rich while the war continues. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

Humor likely wasn't even the point, and instead, the channels posting the claims likely wanted it to be believed as fact – much like the news last summer that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spent $15 million to [buy a Mercedes 770 automobile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/09/despite-online-claims-ukraines-zelensky-didnt-buy-hitlers-car/")
 that was previously owned by Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, or that Zelensky's wife purchased a [Bugatti sports car](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/07/02/social-media-posts-claim-zelenskys-wife-spent-millions-on-bugatti-sportscar/")

Content: "Greene's trades have often drawn red flags due to her committee roles and the timing of the trades.

Musk's comments on Congressional wealth comes after former President **Joe Biden** supported a ban on Congress trading last year.

"Nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they're in the Congress," Biden said in an interview.

Biden said he was able to live on a Congressional salary and not worry about becoming rich through playing the stock market previously.

Representative **Ro Khanna** (D-Calif.) [previously told Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/general/politics/24/05/39096827/exclusive-khanna-says-shameful-congress-members-profited-from-stocks-calls-for-trading-ban-makin?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)
 that he will continue to advocate for a vote to ban the practice.

“We should have a vote on it,” Khanna told Benzinga.

Khanna said that despite his continued speeches in the House advocating for a ban on stock trading, there is a “collective shrug” in Congress regarding the issue.

"It is shameful that over three years after the pandemic with the shenanigans from those senators who sold their stock after learning of the pandemic" there still hasn't been a vote, Khanna said.

Khanna said that people were outraged at the time when several senators sold their stocks in tourism and other sectors that would be hurt, knowing that the economy could crash from the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Senators making money when the rest of the country was suffering during the pandemic."

 in 2023 through a collaboration with Subversive. Does anyone know?" Musk tweeted.

The quoted tweet included the following members of Congress:

*   **Nancy Pelosi** (D-Calif.): Annual salary $223,000, Net worth $202 million
    
*   **Mitch McConnell** (R-Ky.): Annual salary $200,000, Net worth $95 million
    
*   **Chuck Schumer** (D-N.Y.): Annual salary $210,000, Net worth $75 million
    
*   **Elizabeth Warren** (D-Mass.): Annual salary: $285,000, Net worth $67 million
    

The replies included a post from the original poster with additional examples of politicians who have net worths of more than $50 million.

"I am not suggesting anything. While the former speaker of the house has been accused of providing insider information to her husband in the past, her husband makes investments as part of his career.

People in the comments were quick to point out inaccuracies in the net worth amounts with Warren estimated to be worth significantly less than this amount.

Story Continues

**Why It's Important:** Musk's post took aim at members of Congress regardless of their political party.

In comments made alongside **Donald Trump,** Musk said he questions how members of Congress are getting significantly wealthier while in office, while joking that maybe they're just good at investing.

"I think the reality is they're getting wealthier to taxpayer expense," Musk said.

An investigation into members of Congress and their investing activity and payments made by special interest groups while in office could reveal that members of both the Republican and Democratic parties made questionable moves to help boost their wealth.

This could be an interesting move by Musk, who is currently aligned with the Republican party and has the support of many Republican members of Congress.

The Unusual Whales congressional trading report for 2024 showed that Democrats averaged a 31.1% return in 2024 and Republicans averaged a 26.1% return versus the S&P 500 at 24.9%.

The top 10 traders in 2024 list was made up of six Republicans and four Democrats with five Congress members having returns of more than 100% in 2024.

Of the individuals listed in Musk's quoted tweet above, Pelosi ranked 10th in 2024 at +70.9%. Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk Questions Congress Members' Wealth: 'Where Did They Get All The Money?'
=================================================================================

[Chris Katje](/author/)

Thu, Feb 13, 2025, 8:00 PM 5 min read

Billionaire **Elon Musk** targeted members of Congress who enjoy rising wealth amounts while in office, which comes as retail traders place larger emphasis on politicians’ [stock and options trading activity.](https://www.benzinga.com/topic/congress-trading?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site&nid=43707262)

**What Happened:** Members of Congress can buy and sell stocks, options and cryptocurrency as long as they disclose the transactions in a timely manner.

This activity has drawn increased scrutiny in recent years as trades made by members of Congress often appear to be conflicts of interest based on non-public knowledge and can sometimes be stocks related to government-funded contracts.

     **Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.**
    

A post that discussed several prominent members of Congress with their annual salaries and net worths caught the attention of Musk, who is currently the world's richest person worth $379 billion.

"It's not like these politicians started companies or were NBA All-Stars, so where did they get all the money? Make your own conclusions," the poster tweeted.

The annual salaries in the post could include other sources of income and may not be strictly their Congressional salary.

The post also doesn't take into account how much the net worth of members of Congress was before they took office or what their spouses do.

Pelosi's husband **Paul Pelosi** is a venture capitalist who regularly buys and sells technology stocks. McConnell ranked 21st at +42.4%.

A Napa, California, home and vineyard the California Democrat owns is worth between $5 million and $25 million and generated between $100,001 and $1 million in income from grape sales, according to her 2019 report.

The couple also own several commercial properties that generate rental income in that same range and hold investments in undeveloped real estate.

While assets listed on the form total between $57 million and $271 million, liabilities range from $20 million to $97 million. Liabilities include multimillion-dollar mortgages on several properties and equity credit lines.

Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The claim: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has amassed more than $196 million in wealth working on a congressional salary of $193,400
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is one of the richest members of Congress, but a social media post circulating about the wealth she has built while earning a congressional salary is wrong about her net worth.

The post claims Pelosi has been in office for 28 years, during which she earned $193,400 per year. <image:1238>

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021, in Washington.

Fact check: No, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't worth $196 million

1 of 2

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gavels in the final vote of the impeachment of President Donald Trump, for his role in inciting an angry mob to storm the Congress last week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. That’s about $90 million less than the figure cited in the meme.

Where is all that money coming from?

Pelosi has been in Congress since 1987, when [members were paid $89,500.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1011.pdf)
 Today, as [speaker, Pelosi earns $223,500.](https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries)
 As minority leader, Pelosi would have earned the $193,400 spelled out in the meme.

But her salary from a 34-year career in Congress, including 18 years as minority leader and speaker, doesn’t tell the whole story about the personal wealth she and her husband have built.

 out on July 3, 2024 – both taken after last Thursday’s presidential debate – show that more voters are now supporting former President Donald Trump over President Joe Biden. Biden, 81, [is the first octogenarian to occupy](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/politics/joe-biden-80th-birthday/index.html)
 the Oval Office – and his main rival, former President Donald Trump, is 78.

I [first wrote about most](https://theconversation.com/why-are-us-politicians-so-old-and-why-do-they-want-to-stay-in-office-217024)
 voters’ concerns about the presidential candidates’ ages in the fall of 2023 – and since then, those concerns have only grown. It’s a bipartisan trend: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, is 72, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is 81. Bernie Sanders is 81 and hasn’t mentioned retirement at all.

In the House, California Democrat and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at age 84, is running for reelection for her 19th [full term in office](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-house-speaker-pelosi-seek-re-election-reversing-earlier-plan-2022-01-25/)

 that leading Democrats are questioning Biden’s abilities and stamina because of his age. In February, special counsel Robert Hur [declined to charge Biden with mishandling classified](https://apnews.com/article/biden-memory-age-special-counsel-report-doj-f4232bc8316e556ed467185b67c3e0a8)

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

Senator releases FBI source's claim of Biden bribes from Ukraine

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

 on Thursday. <image:13142>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:13151>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)

Conspirators
------------

The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament,[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)
 right-wing media supportive of Trump,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 and members of the Trump campaign, such as [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and [Steve Bannon](/wiki/Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon")
.[\[43\]](#cite_note-43)

### Russian involvement

Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 lieutenant general [Vladimir Alekseyevin](/wiki/Vladimir_Alekseyev_(general) "Vladimir Alekseyev (general)")
, his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov.[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)
 They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers [Oleksandr Dubinsky](/wiki/Oleksandr_Dubinsky "Oleksandr Dubinsky")
 and [Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
, Prosecutor [Kostiantyn Kulyk](/wiki/Kostiantyn_Kulyk "Kostiantyn Kulyk")
 and businessmen [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 and [Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The three were given ten million dollars[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)
 and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
 Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine.[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)

Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 He also met with [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube")
 channel shutdown. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy.[\[58\]](#cite_note-facing_scrutiny-58)

Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

#### Dmytro Firtash

[Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 was a middleman for [Gazprom](/wiki/Gazprom "Gazprom")
 and connected to the Ukrainian government.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)
 He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by [Russian mob](/wiki/Russian_mob "Russian mob")
 boss [Semion Mogilevich](/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich "Semion Mogilevich")
.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")
 (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections.[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")
,[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)
 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)
 [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")
,[\[69\]](#cite_note-Vicens-2021-69)
 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
, editor-at-large at _[Breitbart News](/wiki/Breitbart_News "Breitbart News")
_ and president of the conservative [Government Accountability Institute](/wiki/Government_Accountability_Institute "Government Accountability Institute")
, was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires".[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets.[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)
 This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine[\[73\]](#cite_note-73)
 and Congress to promote the lie.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)

#### John Solomon

_[Washington Post](/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")
_ attributes [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
, formerly of _[The Hill](/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper) "The Hill (newspaper)")
_, the most responsibility[\[75\]](#cite_note-Farhi-2019-75)
 for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. An internal review by the Hill found "serious doubts about the credibility of Solomon’s Ukrainian sources".[\[77\]](#cite_note-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-78)
 In testimony before Congress, [Alexander Vindman](/wiki/Alexander_Vindman "Alexander Vindman")
 said Solomon's claims were "entirely made up in full cloth".[\[79\]](#cite_note-79)

[Media Matters](/wiki/Media_Matters "Media Matters")
 reported in September 2023 that the previous month Solomon published a State Department briefing memo prepared for Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Ukraine."

US President Donald Trump is focused on peace and has made unprecedented progress in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV in an exclusive conversation today.

Here are the top 10 quotes by Tulsi Gabbard:
--------------------------------------------

1. "Trump remains very committed to combating and defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism. "Trump is also taking action where the previous administration failed. So, President Trump has taken a decisive action for our own safety, security, and prosperity."
    

8. "President Trump is seeing this ongoing conflict with very clear eyes. "Under the previous administration, there was no effort at all towards peace or direct dialogue with Putin to bring an end to this war. So, in a very short period of time, Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any other previous effort. The talks are just beginning between Trump's incoming cabinet and the Bangladesh government, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern."

Newsweek AI is in beta. So already in a very short period of time, President Trump has made much more progress towards peace than any effort that has occurred by anyone, previously.

"I'm sure that President Trump will have a very productive conversation with Putin, once again, rooted in his unwavering commitment to peace."

In the same interview, **Gabbard** also hailed Trump's relationship with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/narendra-modi)
: "With President Trump's leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests."

What Happens Next
-----------------

Trump and Putin are slated to speak over the phone on Tuesday.

_Correction 3/18/25, 8:43 a.m. ET: This article was updated to delete erroneous Associated Press reporting and clarify comments Tulsi Gabbard made about the relationship between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi._

_Update 3/17/25, 6:41 p.m. Her visit to India holds special significance: Gabbard, a veteran, was the first Hindu elected to [Congress](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress)
 when she served as a representative from Hawaii.

What To Know
------------

Gabbard criticized former President [Joe Biden](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden)
's handling of the war in Ukraine and said Trump's push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an "unwavering commitment to peace."

!Trump and Putin <image:1416>

U.S. That prompted Zelensky to say he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal that the Trump administration has pushed for in exchange for continued aid to Ukraine.

Last week, Ukraine agreed to the U.S.'s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, subject to the Kremlin's agreement.

Gabbard criticized former President Joe Biden’s handling of the [war in Ukraine](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 and said Trump’s push for both sides to agree to a ceasefire comes from an “unwavering commitment to peace.”

“Under the previous administration, during which this war began, there was no effort, there was no effort at all towards peace.

Her trip also includes stops in Japan and Thailand.

In the interview with NDTV, Gabbard hailed the relationship between Trump and Indian [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](https://apnews.com/hub/narendra-modi)

“With President Trump’s leadership in the United States, of course Prime Minister Modi’s longstanding leadership here in India, we have two leaders of our two great countries who are very good friends and who are very focused on how we can strengthen those shared objectives and those shared interests.”

Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'
====================================================================

Kyiv (AFP) – France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power".

 ![Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden brands Putin 'butcher'](https://s.france24.com/media/display/99f8a93a-e6c1-11ee-9116-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/img-default-F24.jpg)

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober".

'Going to die anyway'
---------------------

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

In Kharkiv, where authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.

Anna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they do not even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.

"If a bomb drops, we're going to die anyway," she told AFP. Like a volcano is exploding, as if the earth explodes," she said as she rested on a chair at an evacuation centre on the outskirts of Kyiv.

"I write poems and when there are explosions I feel great inspiration."

Bombardments continued over the last 24 hours in Irpin, as well as other cities around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

With the conflict now into a second month, Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military Aleksey Filippov AFP

Ukraine's determined fighters continue to hold back Russia's far-bigger military on the frontlines, and some units are beginning to snatch back control.

Two people were killed by shelling in the village of Stanislav, close to the city of Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have mounted a counter-offensive.

In an update early Sunday, the Ukrainian General Staff said "the allied forces repulsed seven attacks" and destroyed eight tanks in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas of the Donbas.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border that was one of the first to fall under Moscow's control.

Images published by the ministry showed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

Elsewhere, Russian forces took control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, Ukrainian authorities said.

Residents of the town protested, prompting the Russians to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd, they added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was "closely monitoring the situation" and was concerned about the ability of employees at Chernobyl to rotate and return to their homes to rest.

'One percent'
-------------

"There has been no staff rotation at the NPP for nearly a week now," the IAEA said.

Russia's army, which Western analysts said appeared bogged down by tactical, communications and logistics problems, had suggested on Friday it would shift its concentration to eastern Ukraine.

But Biden had cast doubt, saying he was "not sure" Moscow has indeed changed its objectives.

Biden, who was winding up a whirlwind visit to Poland after holding a series of urgent summits in Brussels with Western allies, met key Ukrainian cabinet ministers on Saturday.

In a possible shift on a plan to transfer Soviet-era fighter jets from Poland to Kyiv to boost Ukraine's firepower in the skies -- rejected last month by the Pentagon as too "high risk" -- Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the United States now did not object.

"As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side," Kuleba said in written comments to AFP after the meeting.

In a video address, Zelensky reiterated a call for planes while urging allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons.

"During the meeting..."

**What was claimed:** A video shows the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, calling Vladimir Putin a “butcher” and commenting on his “war crimes” during a press conference with US president Donald Trump.

**Our verdict:** This isn’t quite right. Mr Macron referred to killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and mentioned war crimes, but did not describe President Putin as a “butcher”.

French President Emmanuel Macron Olivier Hoslet / Pool / EPA / TASS

France's President Emmanuel Macron warned Sunday against a verbal "escalation" of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a "butcher" who "cannot remain in power."

The Kremlin had reacted in fury over Biden's comments which it said narrows the window for bilateral relations, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now into a second month.

Macron said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organize the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

The French leader told broadcaster France 3 that he saw his task as "achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means."

"If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions."

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out of the city on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by cars or on evacuation buses, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several attempts at establishing safe routes for civilians to flee have collapsed as both sides trade blame for violating temporary ceasefires.

Mariupol, in the region of Donetsk, has borne the brunt of Russia's assaults, and residents who managed to flee have recounted harrowing scenes of death and destruction.

About 170,000 people remain trapped in the besieged city and authorities have said they fear some 300 civilians may have died in a Russian strike on March 17 that hit a theatre being used as a bomb shelter.

In an impassioned speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden blasted Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power," the US leader said, before the White House clarified that Washington was not seeking regime change.

The Kremlin snapped back, saying "a head of state should stay sober."

### **“Going to die anyway”**

Personal attacks, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, were "narrowing down the window of opportunity" for bilateral relations.

"Biden is weak, sick and unhappy," said Vyacheslav Volodin, president of the lower house of parliament.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country's military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and it has hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools in increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

CNN  — 

Vice President JD Vance warned on Thursday that the United States could hit Russia with economic and military “tools of leverage” if Russian leader Vladimir Putin doesn’t negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Vance said the option of sending US troops to Ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee Kyiv’s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper.

His comments strike a different tone from other recent statements from the White House – including from US President Donald Trump who [suggested this week](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/europe/ukraine-russia-trump-zelensky-intl/index.html)
 that Ukraine “may be Russian someday,” shortly before announcing that peace negotiations would begin immediately after holding a phone call with Putin.

Vance’s statement also contrasts with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has said the US would no longer prioritize European and Ukrainian security. (AP Photo/Alex Babenko)\

The Wall Street Journal interview was published before Vance was set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the high-level Munich Security Conference in Germany.

On arrival in Munich Vance said NATO remains an important alliance for the United States.

“Europe is of course a very important ally to the United States, NATO is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure NATO is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden-sharing in Europe so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia,” Vance said, speaking to reporters beside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

An air of uncertainty and anxiety that has enveloped Europe in the past week, after Trump’s announcement [sparked fears that a “dirty deal”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/europe/europe-dirty-deal-trump-putin-ukraine-deal-intl/index.html)
 may be struck with Putin to end the war on terms favorable to Moscow without Kyiv’s involvement.

Many in Europe were shocked Trump appeared to make key concessions to Moscow before even agreeing to peace talks. [](#maincontent)

Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. This week, he told NATO allies that European and non-European troops – but not Americans – would have to police any agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.

[![Volodymyr Zelenskyy, president of Ukraine speaks to the press during a media briefing on the territory of Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, Thursday, Feb. His and Hegseth’s comments also threw into question the future of NATO’s future unity, resources and funding, a cornerstone of European security since the Second World War.

There was also surprise that Trump spoke to Putin before speaking to Zelensky, with European leaders on Thursday scrambling to make clear any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine at the heart of negotiations.

After Trump’s announcement of the peace deal negotiations, French President Emmanuel Macron also described his return to the White House as an “electroshock” for Europe in an interview with the Financial Times.

Macron underlined the need for Europe to strengthen its economy and defenses, agreeing with Trump’s stance that Ukraine’s security was a European responsibility. 13, 2025. 13, 2025. But he also emphasized that only Ukraine could negotiate for itself, and that any peace that was a “capitulation” would be bad news for everyone.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance visits Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site in Dachau, Germany February 13, 2025. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told [Ukraine's military allies](/world/europe/us-defense-chief-hegseth-says-return-ukraines-pre-2014-borders-not-realistic-2025-02-12/)
 in Brussels that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders - before Russia annexed Crimea - was unrealistic and that the U.S. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything is on the table, let’s make a deal.’”

Vance also agreed that Trump might change his mind depending on how the negotiations unfold.

“President Trump could say, look, we don’t want this thing, we might not like this thing, but we’re willing to put it back on the table if the Russians aren’t being good negotiating partners, or there are things that are very important to Ukrainians that we might want to take off the table,” he said.

Feb 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance said the U.S. does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution.

Ukrainians on Thursday worried that Trump was preparing to sell out their country following his phone call Putin.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that Ukraine would be involved in [peace talks with Russia](/world/eu-warns-against-dirty-deal-ukraine-after-trump-putin-phone-call-2025-02-13/)
. He told reporters at the White House that Ukraine would have a seat at the table during any peace negotiations with Russia over ending the war.

Kyiv said it would be premature to speak with Moscow at a security conference on Friday.

“I think there is a deal that is going to come out of this that’s going to shock a lot of people,” the newspaper quoted Vance as saying.

"The president is not going to go in this with blinders on,” Vance said."

The diplomat noted that in 2023, Washington restricted imports of products from several Chinese companies in an attempt to exclude goods allegedly produced with the help of Uygur forced labor from the US supply chain.

"This raises a logical question: will Congress draft a bill imposing sanctions on California authorities, private companies, and ordinary Americans for using prison labor to put out fires?" she wondered. "We are so sick of this hypocrisy!" Zakharova added.

Wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7."

Did Russia offer sanctuary to California residents who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires? A viral X [post](https://x.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1879042008465183185)
 by Jackson Hinkle—a [regular purveyor](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/11/business/media/jackson-hinkle-israel-gaza-misinformation.html)
 of Russia-related misinformation—claims so.

“BREAKING: RUSSIA has offered shelter & sanctuary to Californians whose livelihoods were DESTROYED in the LA wildfires,” reads the post, which had more than 500,000 views on X as of January 15.

Assessing Claims That Russia Offered Sanctuary to California Fire Victims
=========================================================================

One Russian governor did make an offer, but there are some caveats.

! A single Russian governor said that he would welcome California fire victims to the region of occupied Ukraine he oversees, but only if they don’t support the government in Kyiv.

On Monday, Vladimir Saldo, the governor of the Russian-occupied Kherson oblast region of Ukraine, [told](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/22867057)
 _TASS_—a Russian state-controlled media outlet—that the region would accept any Americans who lost their homes in this month’s California fires. “Despite the ongoing, blatantly anti-Russian policy of the United States, we fully understand that natural disasters don’t care who you are or what you do,” Saldo said, [according to](https://www.rt.com/russia/610836-california-fires-sanctuary-kherson/)
 Russia Today, a Russian state-controlled network that translated the statement into English. Therefore, our region is ready to welcome any American citizen who has lost their home and livelihood.”

That offer comes with a caveat, applying only to Californians who haven’t supported Ukraine since Russia invaded its borders in February 2022. Sutton")

Other Russian Telegram channels are also spreading false or unverified narratives about the southern California fires and the government's response, as well as amplifying critiques from Americans including the president-elect's son, Donald Trump, Jr., Andy Carvin of the Atlantic Council's DFRLab told NPR in an email.

"Over the last week, Pravda has published at least 350 stories of this type \[based on Telegram messages about the fires\], based on our initial content analysis of the site," Carvin said.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Tasnim News Agency published an article on January 12, 2025, discussing Russia's comments on the California wildfires, including comments from Maria Zakharova. The article mentions that wildfires began to spread across Los Angeles County on January 7. ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/01/12/3236714/russia-notes-us-hypocrisy-in-california-fire-case)) <image:4830>, <image:4831>

The Dispatch published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing claims that Russia offered sanctuary to California fire victims. Vladimir Saldo offered to accept Americans who lost their homes in the California fires, but only those who haven't supported Ukraine since February 2022. ([https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/](https://thedispatch.com/article/assessing-claims-that-russia-offered-sanctuary-to-california-fire-victims/)) <image:4838>

An NPR article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses how pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a narrative about the Los Angeles wildfires. The article states that Russian news sites are spreading false or unverified narratives about the California fires. ([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) <image:4849>, <image:4853>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.

[Print Article](/download/article/23979)

Last week, devastating wildfires ignited across Los Angeles County in what is one of the most destructive natural disasters in US history. But as firefighters continue to battle the flames, false and misleading information about the disaster [has spread](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/10/rightwing-misinformation-los-angeles-fire)
 just as quickly on social media. While much of the false information seemingly originated from users in the United States, Russian state-affiliated accounts also leveraged the California wildfires and narratives reverberating among certain segments of the US public to sow division, undermine trust in relief efforts, and reduce public support for Ukraine.  

**Diverting Resources to Ukraine** 

Amid the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, Russian government officials and state-affiliated media have propagated narratives critical of the Biden administration and other Democratic leaders to aggravate political division, particularly on Ukraine, and to denigrate the United States. Russian-state controlled outlet Sputnik further [mocked](https://x.com/Sputnik_India/status/1879127371049001320)
 Biden’s emergency relief payments to victims of the wildfires, claiming that they receive less daily per capita than people in Ukraine and Israel.  

Russian state-controlled media outlets further [honed in](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
 [on reports](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877282105815597399)
 that the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) donated surplus equipment to Ukraine in 2022 [to suggest](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877345987468882396)
 that those donations [created a lack of](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877126472915128820)
 resources to fight fires. Additionally, Russian state media seized on the fires to fuel divides on other partisan policy issues, linking the fires to the “[green lobby](https://sputnikglobe.com/20250109/california-wildfires-unexpected-links-to-us-green-lobby-and-ukraine-1121391704.html)
” and [blaming](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1877151147703562608)
 the firefighter shortage on COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

**Amplifying** **AI-Generated Content**

In at least one case, Russian state media amplified a misleading image generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Other Russian-language media outlets subsequently spread the image. 

**Conclusion** 

Kremlin-affiliated accounts have leveraged the California wildfires to further advance Russia’s geopolitical agenda. In a press conference on January 14, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov [claimed](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1879100711361016212)
 the estimated $250 billion worth of damage sustained from the California fires is comparable to the amount Washington “pumped into Ukraine”. Russia’s messaging on the wildfires further underlines a trend of autocratic states [exploiting natural disasters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/russia-china-cuba-amplified-falsehoods-recent-hurricanes-us-official-s-rcna177672)
 to advance their geopolitical goals. This approach keeps with Russia’s now [longstanding strategy](https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/a-year-of-disinformation-russia-and-chinas-influence-campaigns-during-the-war-in-ukraine/)
 to dent US support for Ukraine by playing to pocketbook issues and perceptions that domestic issues have received less attention than foreign ones. 

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/rt%201.png)

**Blaming DEI**

Accounts affiliated with Russia echoed narratives prominent among American audiences that claim diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives hindered wildfire recovery efforts. Russian state-controlled media outlet RT [accused](https://x.com/RT_com/status/1876870822637248582)
 LAFD Chief Kristen Crowly—the first woman and openly gay person to serve in the role—of prioritizing DEI initiatives at the expense of preventing fires. Sputnik also [posted](https://x.com/SputnikInt/status/1877278684240859332)
 a local news clip of a California resident who claimed that “gay people” were the cause of the fires."

**Communities in Los Angeles continue to grapple with the lasting effects of the devastating Palisades and Eaton wildfires, which destroyed more than 16,000 structures and displaced tens of thousands of residents.**

Following emergency distributions of **hygiene supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), re-entry kits, and other items,** Project HOPE’s Emergency Response Team is now focusing on filling the existing service gap in mental health and resilience programming for children, parents, teachers, and social workers who are processing the trauma and devastation of the wildfires.

### How is Project HOPE responding to the wildfires in Los Angeles?

  
**Project HOPE has reached over 16,000 fire-affected community members since the beginning of our response.** This support includes health consultations (provided through local partners) and distributions of air purifiers, air filters, PPE, re-entry kits, dignity products, clean water, over-the-counter medicines, and Psychological First Aid items for children. 

**Project HOPE has developed a comprehensive mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) program to strengthen the capacity of frontline workers and meet the urgent mental health needs of children.** Beginning with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, Project HOPE will be supporting direct engagement with children impacted by the fires, including those displaced and those who have lost their homes.

### **What are the greatest health needs following the wildfires?**  

![firefighter gathering gear to handle fire in the background](/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/0014_USA_CaliforniaFire_RVeliu_01_2025.webp)

The health impacts of wildfires are expected to be severe, especially for marginalized communities and people with pre-existing health conditions. While wildfires differ from hurricanes and the scales of devastation are different, we know that mental health issues are likely to skyrocket following this disaster. 

“I’ve faced crises and emergencies across the country and around the world, but the apocalyptic conditions unfolding here in my own community of Los Angeles are unlike anything I’ve ever experienced,” said Chessa Latifi, Deputy Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response for Project HOPE. Project HOPE is on the ground in Los Angeles providing long-term support following the devastating wildfires.

([https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine)) <image:4849>, <image:4853>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Russia commented on the California wildfires and that Vladimir Saldo offered sanctuary to fire victims. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Russia offered assistance for the California wildfires.

The NPR article suggests that Russian news sites spread false or unverified narratives about the fires. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, information about any specific offers of assistance from Russia would be needed.

Senate Leaders Finalize Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress
====================================================================

[Back to Blog](https://www.acec.org/news/blog-last-word/)

![Washington DC, US Capitol Building](https://www.acec.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/AdobeStock_904736501-1200x800-landscape-6c888ef13f0fe19ac1b3fb6c4a765b28-ra284zgqv9t1.jpeg "Washington DC, US Capitol Building")

Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have announced committee assignments for the new Congress, including appointments for newly elected members.

On the Finance Committee, which will take the lead in crafting an extension and modification of the 2017 tax law, Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) is the only new Republican addition to this key committee. He will be joined by fellow freshmen senators Adam Schiff (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

The Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee, with responsibility for aviation and surface transportation policy, will include Senators Bernie Moreno (R-OH), Tim Sheehy (R-MT), and Curtis. There was significant turnover on the Democratic side, with senators Sanders (I-VT), Smith (D-MN), Lujan (D-NM), Warnock (D-GA), and Welch (D-VT) replacing departing members.

Newly elected John Curtis (R-UT) will be joining the Environment & Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal highway, water, and environmental infrastructure programs. On the Democratic side, the committee adds newly elected senators Andy Kim (D-NJ) and Blunt Rochester.

Senators Jim Justice (R-WV) and Dave McCormack (R-PA) will join the Energy Committee on the majority side, along with Senator Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) on the minority.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For a few gripping minutes, Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment prosecutor against President Donald Trump, had made the restless Senate snap to attention.

Voice cracking as he spoke, Schiff made an impassioned plea late Thursday for removing Trump from office, framing the choice in moral terms."

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results show that both John Thune and Adam Schiff have committee assignments, but there is no evidence that Thune blocked Schiff's assignments. The provided evidence does not support the claim.

From [Source](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/senate-republicans-unforced-error-on-the-capitol-riot-commission/): 
Content: "Adam Schiff and some of the other Democrats Pelosi picked on the panel will wear out the carpet between the committee room and the TV live-shot locations during the hearings, but now Republicans won’t have their wrecking crew there to discredit the proceedings. John Thune, part of the Republican leadership team that helped defeat the measure, said that an independent commission would be a distraction from the GOP’s “midterm message.” “Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections,” Thune told CNN, “is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us and the Democrats’ very radical left-wing agenda.” Plus, Thune fretted, the commission’s findings could be “weaponized politically and drug into next year.” Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, one of just six Republicans to support the creation of the commission, seemed to agree with Thune’s premise as she lamented “a decision for the short-term political gain.”

But what if there is no gain?

Senate Republicans managed to kill an independent commission of experts chosen on a bipartisan basis that was required to finish its work by the end of the year. It looks quite the opposite today.

Members like Thune and Blunt knew that if they defeated the commission, Pelosi would make good on her threat to empanel a special select committee to take up the probe. The pressure is on McCarthy now to punish Cheney and Kinzinger with some kind of official opprobrium, like stripping them of their committee assignments, for accepting Pelosi’s appointments. In its place, they will now have a committee of politicians selected entirely by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The committee will have no deadline, but will still retain at least a veneer of bipartisanship thanks to Pelosi’s inclusion of two Republican members, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Even better for Democrats, the committee itself is a powerful tool to divide and distract Republicans. But the select committee’s work, which will begin on Tuesday, will have significant consequences for Senate Republicans’ hopes of regaining the majority next year.

Let’s stipulate here that most of the Senate Republicans who voted against the commission either genuinely oppose additional inquest into the attack or are too scared of a primary challenge to say otherwise. But they also would have expected that the committee would quickly devolve into partisan farce, much as much of the committee work in the House does these days."

**Thune Previews Plans for 2025 Reconciliation Bills** – Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) stated in a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans last week that he will seek to pass a budget reconciliation bill within the first 30-days of the new Trump administration that focuses on border security, defense, and energy. While Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has already been selected by Republicans as their nominee, he will need to be elected speaker by a majority of the chamber come January.

Incoming Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has also posted the Senate’s [calendar](https://x.com/SenJohnThune/status/1864741224663425087) for 2025. John Duarte’s (R-Calif.) loss to former state assemblyman Adam Gray (D). Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Andy Kim (D-N.J.) resigned from the House of Representatives and will be sworn in on Monday as members of the U.S. Thune then plans to work to pass a second reconciliation bill later in the year to deal with extending the 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Thune’s agenda is at odds with the goals of some Republicans in the House of Representatives, who are aiming to pass a tax bill within President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office.

**Lawmakers Continue Negotiations on Year-End Package, Health Extenders** – Members of Congress continue to negotiate a year-end funding package that could include health care related extenders. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will serve as chair of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, replacing retiring Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) will chair the Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) to continue to serve as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee."

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.

| Member of the [U.S. The fact that we have questions about this is in itself harmful".[\[84\]](#cite_note-84)
 The next morning on Twitter, Trump called Schiff "Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into 'Russia'" and called the Russian collusion investigation "the Dem loss excuse".[\[85\]](#cite_note-85)
 Schiff responded on Twitter that the president's "comments and actions are beneath the dignity of the office".[\[86\]](#cite_note-86)

In December 2018, Schiff suggested that Trump associate [Roger Stone](/wiki/Roger_Stone "Roger Stone")
 might have lied to Congress, and said the transcript of his testimony should be forwarded to the Special Counsel.[\[87\]](#cite_note-87)
 In November 2019, Stone was convicted of lying to Congress.[\[88\]](#cite_note-88)

When he became chair of the House Intelligence Committee in 2019, Schiff embarked on a personal mission to investigate Trump's connections to Russia, separate from the Special Counsel investigation.[\[89\]](#cite_note-89)
 He came under fire when he demurred when asked if he would accept it if the Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Trump had not colluded with Russia, saying that he had great confidence in Mueller but that "there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt", as is needed for a criminal conviction.[\[90\]](#cite_note-90)

On March 28, 2019, the nine Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee officially called for Schiff to resign due to his allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russians in the 2016 election.[\[91\]](#cite_note-91)
 Schiff responded by accusing the Republican members of tolerating "immoral" and "corrupt" conduct by Trump campaign members and administration appointees.[\[92\]](#cite_note-92)
[\[93\]](#cite_note-93)

 but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a [separatist war](/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_conflict "Nagorno-Karabakh conflict")
 in 1994.[\[121\]](#cite_note-121)
 He reiterated that call in April 2023.[\[122\]](#cite_note-122)

On July 1, 2021, Pelosi appointed nine members (seven Democrats and two Republicans) to the [Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol](/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack")
, which included Schiff.

On June 21, 2022, Schiff led Day 4 of the committee's [public hearings](/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack_public_hearings "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack public hearings")
, which included testimony from three Republican officials to whom Trump reached out after the election: Georgia secretary of state [Brad Raffensperger](/wiki/Brad_Raffensperger "Brad Raffensperger")
, his deputy Gabe Sterling, and Arizona House of Representatives speaker [Rusty Bowers](/wiki/Rusty_Bowers "Rusty Bowers")
.[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)
 The second half of the hearing focused on Trump supporters' harassment of and threats to Georgia poll worker [Wandrea' ArShaye Moss](/wiki/Wandrea%27_ArShaye_Moss "Wandrea' ArShaye Moss")
 and her family, which led her to quit her job and go into hiding.[\[124\]](#cite_note-124)

Schiff was interviewed after the hearing by reporters and called the testimony "enormously powerful".[\[125\]](#cite_note-125)
 He added, "The lie lives on, and with it so does the danger."

#### Ban on stock trading

Schiff supports a ban on stock trading by members of Congress.[\[126\]](#cite_note-126)

In April 2018, when asked whether he thought Trump deserved at least partial credit for North Korea's involvement in talks with the U.S., Schiff replied: "I think it's more than fair to say that the combination of the president's unpredictability and indeed his bellicosity had something to do with the North Koreans deciding to come to the negotiating table".[\[99\]](#cite_note-99)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from ACEC.org discusses the Senate committee assignments for the 119th Congress, mentioning that Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) was assigned to the Finance Committee and that Senate Republican Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced the committee assignments. [<image:2574>] and [<image:1>] The document from torreydc.com lists the Senate Committee Assignments for the 119th Congress, with Adam Schiff (D-CA) assigned to several committees and John Thune (R-SD) assigned to others. The document does not mention any blocking of committee assignments. The document from hklaw.com lists the committee assignments for the House of Representatives and the Senate for the 118th Congress. Adam Schiff is listed as a member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, and John Thune is listed as a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ap-top-news-ca-state-wire-adam-schiff-politics-3eec3ea9be5c07a9c297bad439f8f3e8): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about Adam Schiff, mentioning his role as the lead impeachment prosecutor against Donald Trump. <image:i> The article states that Schiff has been a frequent target of conservatives since the then GOP-led House Intelligence Committee started investigating Trump’s ties to Russia in the 2016 election.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation. The search results mention committee assignments for both senators but do not indicate any blocking. One article mentions Schiff's role in the Russia investigation, but it does not link this to any action by Thune regarding committee assignments.

The provided evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether Thune took any action to block Schiff's committee assignments and the reasons behind such actions.


## Actions
```
web_search("John Thune statement Adam Schiff committee assignments")
web_search("Adam Schiff committee assignments blocked John Thune reason")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results do not provide any information about John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. One article discusses John Thune's concerns about a commission and another mentions Thune's plans as Senate Majority Leader, but neither mentions any action related to Schiff's committee assignments.

## Elaboration
The evidence continues to lack information to support the claim. The search results do not mention John Thune blocking Adam Schiff's committee assignments. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

Sen. John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, speaks during a press conference inside the U.S. John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, speaks during a press conference inside the U.S. Senate Friday under the new leadership of South Dakota’s John Thune, who promised to keep intact the body’s legislative filibuster — the 60-vote threshold for major legislation that some Democrats had targeted for elimination.

Thune follows in the footsteps of the longest-serving Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and takes the reins as Republicans prepare to control the Senate, House and White House once President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan.

Still, Thune hammered in his opening remarks at the start of the 119th Congress that the Senate must remain the “more stable, more thoughtful, more deliberative” body.

“Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives,” Thune said on the floor.

“And that,” he continued, “is not what our founders intended or what our country needs. Adam Schiff of California and New Jersey’s Andy Kim took their oaths in December.

[!Sen. 20.

In his first opening remarks as leader, Thune said he would restore the upper chamber as “a place of discussion and deliberation” as the body pursues an aggressive agenda to overhaul immigration and extend 2017 tax cuts — not to mention actually funding the government, albeit months late, once temporary measures expire in March.

The evidence does not support the claim that John Thune blocked Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation.

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)
, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. In February, the US [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/mike-turner-national-security-threat)
 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. Only a limited number of hard copies have been distributed to select national security officials and Pentagon leaders, the newspaper reported.

The newspaper added, however, that in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the change prior to a more comprehensive and unclassified update to Congress that is anticipated before Biden's term concludes.

The Pentagon believes that China’s nuclear arsenal will rival the size and diversity of US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade, the Times reported.

“The president recently released updated guidance for nuclear weapons employment to address the presence of multiple nuclear-armed adversaries,” the newspaper cited Vipin Narang, a nuclear strategist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who previously worked at the Pentagon, as saying earlier this month before returning to academia.

He further noted that this guidance specifically considers “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal, it added.

In June, the National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, Pranay Vaddi, said Biden "recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance, which takes into account the realities of a new nuclear era."

"It emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity of the PRC’s nuclear arsenal—and the need to deter Russia, the PRC and North Korea simultaneously," he added, referring to the People’s Republic of China, China’s official name.

White House National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett told Anadolu that the US nuclear policy is updated regularly as part of their efforts to "reduce nuclear risks and maintain stable deterrence.”

"This administration—like the four administrations before it—issued a Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning Guidance. 30, 2025](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/morning-briefing-aug-30-2025/3673279)

Russia repeatedly stated that arms supplies to Ukraine hinder the settlement and directly involve NATO countries in the conflict. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the United States and NATO were directly involved in the conflict not only by providing weapons but also by training Ukrainian personnel in European countries.

Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed in the Zaporozhye direction. Russian Defence Ministry / TASS

Moscow said Tuesday that it had captured several German Leopard tanks and U.S. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, releasing footage showing Russian troops surveying the equipment supplied to Ukraine by Western countries.

"Leopard tanks and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. These are our trophies. Equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces in the Zaporizhzhia region," the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.

"Servicemen of the Vostok group inspect enemy tanks and infantry fighting vehicles captured in battle."

Kyiv has appealed to its allies in the West to deliver a broad range of modern military equipment to help Ukrainian forces recapture large swathes of territory controlled by Russian forces.

The Defense Ministry said several of the captured vehicles had working engines, suggesting that the battles they were involved in had been short and that Ukrainian troops had "fled" their offensive positions.

**(DEFENCE SECURITY ASIA) — During the week of May 11 to 17, Russian military claimed to have successfully destroyed five Leopard 2A1 tanks, manufactured by the German company Krauss-Maffei but donated to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help the Eastern Europe country in its armed conflict with Russia.**

**In addition to the Leopard tanks, the Russian Ministry of Defense also alleged that 13 armored vehicles, 55 various vehicles, “Grad” multiple rocket launcher systems, and 47 artillery units—22 of which were supplied by foreign countries—were destroyed during this period.**

**Moreover, four Mi-24 helicopters and 40 unmanned boats belonging to the Ukrainian military were reportedly destroyed by Russia in the same timeframe.**

**Among the foreign-supplied armored vehicles to Ukraine, the Leopard tanks have been the most frequently supplied to Kyiv compared to other models such as the American-made Abrams and the British-made Challengers.**

**Since last year, countries such as Germany and several other European nations have supplied between 100-200 Leopard tanks to Ukraine for use in a spring counteroffensive against Russian positions.**

**“Russian Soldiers Pose in Front of Captured Leopard 2A6 Tank”**

**Line of Leopard tanks and Bradley armoured infantry fighting vehicle were destroyed in Zaphorizia, southern Ukraine.**

**Although the Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023 initially started well, it faced increasingly formidable opposition from Russian forces who began altering their tactics and strategies.**

**These changes in strategy and tactics by the Russian forces led to the destruction of many of the Ukrainian tanks that had been supplied by donor countries like Germany, other European nations, the United States, and Britain.**

**However, to date, no one knows exactly how many Leopard tanks have been destroyed by Russia.**

**Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly stated to his country’s war correspondents that Ukraine has lost more than 160 tanks supplied by foreign countries.**

**Given the high volume of Leopard tanks supplied to Ukraine, it is logical to conclude that many of the tanks destroyed by Russia were Leopard models.**

**Regarding the Abrams tanks, the Russian military stated that of the 31 American-made tanks supplied to Ukraine, more than five of the tanks have been destroyed by Russian forces.**

**A charred M1A1 Abrams main battle tank being transported to Moscow to participate in an exhibition at Victory Park.**

 **As a result of the destruction of five Abrams tanks, the United States has reportedly “withdrawn” these tanks from the Ukrainian battlefield, likely in an effort to “preserve its reputation.”**

**Following the destruction experienced by Leopard tanks supplied by Germany and other European countries, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andii Melnyk has requested that Kiev be supplied with more Leopard tanks, including the latest variant, the Leopard 2A6.**

 **However, the newest Leopard 2A6 variant supplied to Ukraine has met the same fate.**

**The Russian military reported capturing the most powerful tank in the Ukrainian arsenal, the German-made Leopard 2A6, after intense fighting in Avdiivka, Ukraine, last April.**

**It is believed that Ukraine possesses 21 Leopard 2A6 tanks, with 18 of these tanks developed by the companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall being donated by Germany, while the remainder were provided by Portugal.**

**However, most of these Leopard 2A6 tanks donated to the Ukrainian military could not be used after failing to be properly maintained and remained inoperable as claimed by a senior German politician last January.**

**An Abrams tank caught fire after being struck by a Lancet kamikaze drone and an RPG from Russian forces.**

**According to Russian military sources, after capturing and removing the tank from the combat area, Russian forces transported the tank and sent it to Moscow, possibly for research purposes.**

**The Leopard 2A6 was successfully captured after a Russian platoon executed an ambush that caused the Ukrainian tank crew to abandon the German-made vehicle.**

**The Leopard 2A6 represents an upgrade from the Leopard 2A5, incorporating enhanced armor protection, firepower, and electronic warfare capabilities.**

**The tank measures 9.97 meters in length and weighs 62.3 tons, making it one of the heaviest main battle tanks ever deployed, with an engine power of 1,500 horsepower.**

**Capable of speeds up to 75 km/h and with an operational range of 500 km, it is equipped with a Rheinmetall 120 mm L/55 cannon, allowing it to fire all standard NATO ammunition types, including APFSDS, HEAT, and multi-purpose shells.**

**The Leopard 2A6 also features dual 7.62 mm MG3A1 machine guns and an advanced fire control system including a laser rangefinder, thermal imaging, and a ballistic computer. — DSA**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that his forces had advanced up to 3 kilometres (1.86 miles) in Russia's Kursk region, taking control of two more settlements there.

Russia said it had struck Ukraine's 22nd and 115th Mechanized Brigades, the 82nd Airborne Assault Brigade, and a Guard and Support Brigade in at least 12 different places with air strikes, artillery and infantry.

Moscow said it had also repelled attacks at seven additional places in Kursk and had struck Ukrainian forces at 16 other locations in Ukraine's neighbouring Sumy region.

"Units of the northern group of forces, with the support of army aviation and artillery fire, repelled attacks by enemy assault groups in the direction of the settlements of Kremyanoye, Malaya Loknya and Nechayev," Russia's defence ministry said in a statement.

It said Russian forces had also "thwarted attempts to attack in the direction of Komarovka, Spalnoye, Korenevo, Pogrebky and Olgovka."

The ministry said it was seeking to identify and destroy Ukrainian sabotage units which had hidden in the forests in an attempt to penetrate deeper into Russian sovereign territory.

While the Kursk incursion has grabbed headlines, Russian officials say the attack will fail to draw Russian forces away from the east of Ukraine where they are still advancing. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports from either side.

Russia also gave estimates for Ukrainian losses in Kursk, but Reuters does not publish combatant estimates from either side.

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

Taking the fight to Russia
--------------------------

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

![INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_28-1724833592](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-ATTACK_ON_KURSK_AUG_20-1724833592.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

![INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN SOUTHERN UKRAINE-1724833604](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-SOUTHERN-UKRAINE-1724833604.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. “I reiterate that lifting restrictions on the use of capabilities against the Russian military involved in aggression against Ukraine, in accordance with international law, would strengthen Ukrainian self-defence, save lives and reduce destruction in Ukraine,” he said on Monday.

Russian officials bared their teeth against any such decision and hit out against the fact that both Brussels and Washington have allowed the use of US and European equipment in Ukraine’s Kursk offensive.

“The West does not want to avoid escalation."
