## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. While the BBC and Journal of Democracy articles discuss Putin's actions and policies, including his hostility towards the United States, they do not mention a declaration of war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from Fact Crescendo directly refutes the claim, stating that there has been no declaration of war. The other sources discuss related topics but do not support the claim. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

According to [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/did-russia-declare-war-against-the-usa/), there has been no official declaration of war. While other sources discuss Putin's actions and policies, they do not support the claim.
