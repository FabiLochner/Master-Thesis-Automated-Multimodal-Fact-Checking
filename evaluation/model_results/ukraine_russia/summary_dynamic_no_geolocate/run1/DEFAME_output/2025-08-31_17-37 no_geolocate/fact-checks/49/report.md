According to the Eurovision News | Spotlight ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)), the video shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs, not Israeli bombs. Zelenskyy wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on the shells, referencing Ukraine's war with Russia.

The images show Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. ![image 16](media/49.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image shows Zelenskyy signing munitions at a U.S. munitions factory in support of Ukraine's defense needs, not Israeli bombs. The munitions were artillery shells, and Zelenskyy wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on them.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing munitions at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. This event was part of his visit to support Ukraine's defense, as reported by the Eurovision News | Spotlight ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)) and confirmed by other sources like Fox News and Caliber.Az.
