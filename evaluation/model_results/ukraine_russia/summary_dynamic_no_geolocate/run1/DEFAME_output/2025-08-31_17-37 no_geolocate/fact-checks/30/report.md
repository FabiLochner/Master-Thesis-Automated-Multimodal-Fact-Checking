## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 21, 2025, discussing Donald Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war, including a meeting with Zelenskyy on August 18, 2025, and a planned trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy (![image 4898](media/2025-08-28_15-35-1756395339-850858.jpg)). Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations, mentioning events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, including a meeting between Trump, Macron, and Zelenskyy in December 2024, and Trump's push for peace negotiations after winning the election. A CNN article from August 19, 2025, discusses the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal, mentioning Trump's support for a peace deal and Ukraine's preference for a ceasefire (<image:0>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/3.jpg), ![image 3](media/4.jpg), ![image 4](media/5.jpg)).

The CNN article also states that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be illegal under the UN Charter.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that while peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, a peace deal had not yet been reached in early 2025. The Guardian and CNN articles from August 2025 discuss ongoing efforts and differing views on a peace deal versus a ceasefire. The Wikipedia entry mentions events up to December 2024 and a timeline for 2025, including meetings and negotiations, but does not confirm a deal was reached in early 2025.

The CNN article highlights the complexities of reaching a peace deal, particularly the legal implications of any agreement that would cede Ukrainian territory. This suggests that negotiations were difficult and that a deal was not easily attainable.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that peace negotiations were ongoing in 2025, but there is no evidence to confirm that a peace deal was reached in early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing efforts and differing views on a peace deal versus a ceasefire.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence from news articles, such as those from The Guardian and CNN, indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing efforts and differing views on a peace deal versus a ceasefire, and the CNN article highlights the complexities of reaching a peace deal, particularly the legal implications of any agreement that would cede Ukrainian territory.
