## Claim
Claim: "![image 22](media/73.jpg) This image shows a Ukrainian F-16 fighter jet which was shot down by Russia as part of the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 22](media/73.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 22](media/73.jpg)) shows the wreckage of an F-16 that crashed into a warehouse in May 2019 due to improperly installed parts or hydraulic failure. The crash occurred near March Air Reserve Base. The pilot ejected and survived. The missiles on board did not explode because they were not armed.

## Elaboration
The image depicts the wreckage of an F-16 fighter jet that crashed in May 2019 near March Air Reserve Base due to mechanical failure, not as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The pilot ejected and survived.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because the image shows a crash that occurred in 2019 due to mechanical failure, not as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
