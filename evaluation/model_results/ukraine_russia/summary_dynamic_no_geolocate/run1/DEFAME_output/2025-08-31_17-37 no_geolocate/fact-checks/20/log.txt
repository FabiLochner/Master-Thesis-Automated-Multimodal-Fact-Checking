Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us): 
Content: Euronews published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that claims circulated on social media that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, threatened to expel the US from the alliance if Donald Trump "surrenders Ukraine to Putin" are false. The article mentions that NATO does not have a specific mechanism to suspend or expel a member and that a spokesperson called the claim "bogus". The article also includes Rutte's statements about working closely with Trump and his acknowledgment of Trump's role in increasing NATO defense spending.

The claim 'After Donald Trump won the US presidential election in 2024, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that ‘If Trump surrenders Ukraine to Putin, he will personally expel the United States from the alliance’.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. A Euronews article ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us)) explicitly states that the quote attributed to Mark Rutte is false and that a NATO spokesperson called the claim "bogus."

So, the overall veracity is: false
