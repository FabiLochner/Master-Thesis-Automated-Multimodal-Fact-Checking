## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us): 
Content: Euronews published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that claims circulated on social media that Mark Rutte, secretary-general of NATO, threatened to expel the US from the alliance if Donald Trump "surrenders Ukraine to Putin" are false. The article mentions that NATO does not have a specific mechanism to suspend or expel a member and that a spokesperson called the claim "bogus". The article also includes Rutte's statements about working closely with Trump and his acknowledgment of Trump's role in increasing NATO defense spending.


## Elaboration
The new evidence directly contradicts the claim. Euronews reported that the quote attributed to Mark Rutte is false and that a NATO spokesperson called the claim "bogus."


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed meetings between Trump and Rutte regarding Ukraine, but did not contain the specific quote. The subsequent search found a Euronews article explicitly debunking the claim, stating that the quote is false and that a NATO spokesperson called it "bogus."

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A Euronews article ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/20/no-natos-chief-has-not-threatened-to-expel-us)) explicitly states that the quote attributed to Mark Rutte is false and that a NATO spokesperson called the claim "bogus."
