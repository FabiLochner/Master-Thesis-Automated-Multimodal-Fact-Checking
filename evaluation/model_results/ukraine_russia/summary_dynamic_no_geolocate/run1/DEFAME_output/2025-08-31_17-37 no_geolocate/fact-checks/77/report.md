## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade showcased various military hardware, including tanks. The parade was part of a four-day celebration from August 14 to 17.

The claim that the image shows a military parade on August 14, 2024, is partially correct, as the celebrations started on that day. However, the main parade took place on August 15, 2024.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the parade was a preparation for war with Russia, although it does mention the event was an expression of strength in the face of threats from the East. Therefore, the claim's assertion about preparing for war is not directly supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which started on August 14. The parade showcased military hardware. However, the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence.

The claim is partially accurate regarding the date and the nature of the event, but the assertion about preparing for war is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`
