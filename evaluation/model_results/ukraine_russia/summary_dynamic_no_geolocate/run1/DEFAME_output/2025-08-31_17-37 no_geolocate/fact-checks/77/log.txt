The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Polish military parade that took place on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and the Polish Ministry of Defence ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)). While the parade showcased military equipment, the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia is not directly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
