Useful result: From [Source](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case): 
Content: Meduza, November 26, 2024, reports that Nikita Zhuravel, convicted in February for burning a Quran, received an additional 13.5 years in prison. He will spend 14 years incarcerated. Zhuravel was arrested in May 2023 for burning a Quran. In October 2024, he was charged with collaborating with Ukraine's security services.

The claim 'In November 2024 Russia sentenced a man to 14 years in prison for burning the Quran.' is false.
Justification: In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison, as reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/)), but this sentence was for treason, not for burning the Quran. He was previously sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran, and later received an additional 13.5 years for treason, according to The Moscow Times ([https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123)) and Meduza ([https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case)).
