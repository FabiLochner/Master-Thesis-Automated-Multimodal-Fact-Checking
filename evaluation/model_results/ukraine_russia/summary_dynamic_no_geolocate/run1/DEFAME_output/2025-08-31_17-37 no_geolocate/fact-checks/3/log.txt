Useful result: From [Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/economist-not-published-apocalypse-cover-154559076.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the image of The Economist cover featuring Trump and Putin with the word "Apocalypse" is not genuine. The article mentions that the image was shared on social media and a Telegram post. The Economist did publish a cover featuring Putin and Trump in February 2024, but it was a different illustration. The article also mentions that Full Fact has contacted The Economist for comment. <image:12888>, <image:12896>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic cover of the magazine The Economist from the end of 2024 illustrating Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin and warning of an apocalypse.' is false.
Justification: The image of The Economist cover depicting Trump and Putin with the word "Apocalypse" is a fabrication. Multiple fact-checking sources, including AAP FactCheck, Ukrinform.net, and Yahoo News, have confirmed its inauthenticity, pointing out grammatical errors and the cover's origin in Russian propaganda. The actual cover of The Economist from November 16, 2024, features a golf club hitting a globe.

So, the overall veracity is: false
