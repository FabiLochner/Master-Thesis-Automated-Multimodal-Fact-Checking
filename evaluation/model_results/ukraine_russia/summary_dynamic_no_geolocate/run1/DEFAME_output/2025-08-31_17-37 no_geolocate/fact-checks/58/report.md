## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Pro-Kremlin social media accounts spread a baseless narrative that mansions belonging to Ukrainian military officials burned down in the Los Angeles wildfires in January 2025. This claim was debunked by fact-checkers from Greece and the United States. The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation described the claim as "Russian propaganda." NPR has not obtained evidence that any Ukrainian generals owned homes in Los Angeles that were destroyed by the fires. The story first emerged on a pro-Russian Telegram channel. The Forbes article states that there is zero evidence to support this claim and that the original post on Telegram was satire, but subsequent reposts lacked any mention of it being a joke. The article mentions Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former Ukrainian four-star general and current ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, as one of the individuals named in the claims. ![image 2335](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598606-937437.jpg), ![image 2342](media/2025-08-07_20-30-1754598640-955496.jpg)

The claim was reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/los-angeles-california-fires-russia-ukraine), [Houston Public Media](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/npr/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5259842/russia-tried-to-use-the-l-a-wildfires-to-spread-anti-ukraine-propaganda/), and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2025/01/13/satire-or-disinformation-ukrainian-generals-lost-homes-in-la-fires/).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Fact-checkers from the United States and Greece debunked the claim. The story originated on a pro-Russian Telegram channel and was described as Russian propaganda by the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council's Center for Countering Disinformation. NPR has not found any evidence to support the claim. Forbes also stated that there is zero evidence to support the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including NPR and Forbes, have debunked the claim, stating there is no evidence to support it. The claim originated from a pro-Russian source and was identified as propaganda.

`false`
