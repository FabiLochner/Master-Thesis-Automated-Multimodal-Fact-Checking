## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Economic Forum published an article about Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address at the Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from January 15â€“19, 2024, where he called on business leaders to invest in Ukraine. The article includes an image of Zelenskyy addressing participants at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024 ![image 10](media/13.jpg).

Yahoo News states that the photo of Zelenskyy and Schwab in suits was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has stopped wearing suits publicly ![image 1763](media/2025-08-07_19-06-1754593598-169511.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image shows Zelenskyy and Schwab at the World Economic Forum. However, the evidence indicates that the photo was taken in January 2020, before the Russian invasion. Since the invasion, Zelenskyy has not worn suits publicly.
