## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Reuters reports that he was sentenced to 14 years for treason, with the court finding him guilty of corresponding online with a member of the Security Service of Ukraine and for acts "directed against the security of the Russian Federation" and was previously serving a sentence for burning a copy of the Quran. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/)) ![image 1874](media/2025-08-07_19-13-1754594007-532509.jpg)

The Moscow Times reports that Zhuravel was sentenced to an additional 13 years and six months in prison for treason. He was previously sentenced to three and a half years in prison for burning the Quran.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters article states that the 14-year sentence was for treason, not for burning the Quran. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/))

Zhuravel was previously sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times and Meduza report that he received an additional sentence of 13.5 years for treason. ([https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123), [https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case))


## Final Judgement
Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced in November 2024. He received a 14-year sentence for treason, not for burning the Quran. He was previously sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran and received an additional 13.5 years for treason.

The claim is partially inaccurate because the 14-year sentence was for treason, not for burning the Quran. The claim is misleading because it does not specify the charges for which the sentences were given. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
In November 2024, Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison, as reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-man-jailed-burning-koran-sentenced-14-years-separate-ukraine-treason-2024-11-25/)), but this sentence was for treason, not for burning the Quran. He was previously sentenced to 3.5 years for burning the Quran, and later received an additional 13.5 years for treason, according to The Moscow Times ([https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2024/11/25/russian-man-jailed-for-quran-burning-sentenced-to-135-more-years-in-prison-for-treason-a87123)) and Meduza ([https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case](https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/11/26/man-beaten-in-police-custody-for-burning-quran-gets-13-5-years-for-treason-against-russia-in-separate-case)).
