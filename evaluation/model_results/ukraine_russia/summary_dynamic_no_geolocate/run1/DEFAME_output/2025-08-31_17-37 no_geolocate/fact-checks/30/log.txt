Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine): 
Content: The search result from Wikipedia discusses peace negotiations in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/europe/ukraine-ceasefire-peace-deal-difference-analysis-latam-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article on August 19, 2025, discussing the difference between a ceasefire and a peace deal in the context of the war between Ukraine and Russia. <image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>. The article mentions that Donald Trump supports a peace deal, while Ukraine wants a ceasefire. The article also states that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be illegal under the UN Charter.

The claim 'In early 2025, Ukraine and Russia had reached a peace deal in their years-long war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence from news articles, such as those from The Guardian and CNN, indicates that while peace negotiations were underway in 2025, a peace deal had not been reached in early 2025. The articles discuss ongoing efforts and differing views on a peace deal versus a ceasefire, and the CNN article highlights the complexities of reaching a peace deal, particularly the legal implications of any agreement that would cede Ukrainian territory.

So, the overall veracity is: false
