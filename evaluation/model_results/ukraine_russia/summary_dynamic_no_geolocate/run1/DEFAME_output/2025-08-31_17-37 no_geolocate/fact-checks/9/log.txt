Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803): Found exact image on website with title: Ukraine war latest news: Zelensky visits troops in Kharkiv region - BBC
Content: The BBC article, published on May 29, 2022, reports that Volodymyr Zelensky visited troops in the Kharkiv region. The article includes several images of Zelensky with soldiers, but none of them are in the Sudzha of Kursk region. <image:1645>, <image:1649>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://telegrafi.com/en/zelensky-on-a-rare-trip-outside-kiev-visited-the-front-line-where-he-met-ukrainian-troops/): Found exact image on website with title: Zelensky, on a rare trip outside Kiev, visited the front line where he ...
Content: The image is found on a website called Telegrafi. The article is about Zelensky's visit to the front line in the Kharkiv region. The article was published 3 years ago. The image is also used in the article. The article also contains other images of Zelensky. <image:1659>, <image:1660>, <image:1661>, <image:1662>, <image:1663>. The image in the claim is included in the article.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While Ukrainian forces did advance into the Kursk region, including Sudzha, in August 2024, the image provided in the claim is from a visit by Zelensky to the Kharkiv region in May 2022, as confirmed by a reverse image search.

So, the overall veracity is: false
