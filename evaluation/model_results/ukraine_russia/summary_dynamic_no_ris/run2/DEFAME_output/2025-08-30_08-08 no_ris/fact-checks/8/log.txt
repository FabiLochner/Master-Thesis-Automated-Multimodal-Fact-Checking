Useful result: From [Source](https://www.economist.com/china/2025/04/10/why-are-chinese-soldiers-fighting-in-ukraine): 
Content: The Economist published an article on April 10, 2025, discussing why Chinese soldiers are fighting in Ukraine. <image:8059>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that the Red Cross Society of China has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts Chinese Red Cross troops setting off to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories. The provided sources show China's humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Chinese soldiers fighting in Ukraine, but not the specific scenario described in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
