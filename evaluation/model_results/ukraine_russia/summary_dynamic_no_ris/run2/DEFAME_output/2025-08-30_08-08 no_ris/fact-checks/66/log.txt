Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945, a key event in the Sovietâ€“Japanese War. It details the Soviet Union's entry into the Pacific Theater, the objectives of the 2nd Far Eastern Front, and the involvement of various Soviet and Mongolian units. The invasion led to the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. The article also mentions the transfer of territories to the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet occupation of Manchuria and North Korea. It also mentions war crimes committed by Soviet soldiers, including killings, rapes, and looting of Japanese and Korean civilians. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchuria/Manchuria-since-c-1900): 
Content: The Britannica website discusses the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, where Japan and Russia fought for control of Manchuria. <image:k> shows a Japanese warship in action during the Russo-Japanese War. The article also mentions the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. The article was last updated on August 14, 2025, and was written by The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/3/china-and-russia-begin-joint-military-drills-in-sea-of-japan): 
Content: Al Jazeera published on August 3, 2025, that China and Russia have begun joint naval drills in the Sea of Japan. <image:1> The drills are near Vladivostok and will last for three days. <image:2> The exercises are not directed against other countries. Japan's Ministry of Defence warned that China's growing military cooperation with Russia poses serious security concerns.

The claim 'China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.' is false.
Justification: The evidence, including historical conflicts like the Soviet invasion of Manchuria ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) and the Russo-Japanese War, along with current joint military drills between China and Russia ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/3/china-and-russia-begin-joint-military-drills-in-sea-of-japan)), does not support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade the Russian Federation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
