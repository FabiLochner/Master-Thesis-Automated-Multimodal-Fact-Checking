## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump and Putin discussed a possible settlement in Ukraine during their phone call on February 12, 2025. Following the call, Trump ordered U.S. officials to begin talks on ending the war. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Trump announced he had reached an agreement to end the war.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. While the call and subsequent actions align with the claim, the evidence does not confirm that Trump announced an agreement.

The claim is missing information about whether Trump announced an agreement.
