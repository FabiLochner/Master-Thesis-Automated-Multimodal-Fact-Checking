## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations ([https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)) states that Ukraine is the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. The article mentions a $20 billion loan provided to the Ukrainian government in late 2024. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war)) reports that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022, and President Trump announced a new arrangement to send weapons last month. ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)

CSIS ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine](https://www.csis.org/analysis/trump-administration-boosts-immediate-military-aid-deliveries-ukraine)) discusses the Trump administration's military aid to Ukraine, including weapons sales totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million approved in May. The policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years. ![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not support the specific amount of $350 billion as of February 2025. NPR states that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance since the full-scale invasion in 2022. The CSIS article mentions weapons sales and aid packages, but not the total amount.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The exact amount of military aid provided by the U.S. to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Final Judgement
The provided sources do not confirm the claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025. While the evidence confirms that the U.S. has provided significant military aid, the specific amount mentioned in the claim is not supported.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has provided substantial military aid to Ukraine, the provided sources, including the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/g-s1-81084/europe-us-weapons-ukraine-russia-war), do not mention the specific amount of $350 billion as of February 2025.
