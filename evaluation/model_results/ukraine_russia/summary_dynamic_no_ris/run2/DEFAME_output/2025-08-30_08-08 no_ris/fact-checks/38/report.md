House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars.

NBC News reports that Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which some Republicans viewed as a signal of which way he wants the November election to go. Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy at the White House.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and met with Kamala Harris. Some Republicans, including JD Vance, have suggested that these actions constitute campaigning for Harris. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Zelenskyy was campaigning for Harris. It only mentions that some viewed his actions as a signal of his preference in the upcoming election.

The evidence also mentions that House Republicans are investigating whether Zelensky's appearance was an improper use of tax dollars. This suggests that there is a debate over the nature of Zelenskyy's actions and whether they constitute election interference.

To fully verify the claim, more information is needed. Specifically, it would be helpful to know the details of Zelenskyy's statements and actions during his visit to Pennsylvania and his meeting with Harris. It would also be helpful to know the outcome of the House Republicans' investigation.
