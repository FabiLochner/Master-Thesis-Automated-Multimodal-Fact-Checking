POLITICO ([https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/)) reported that Olaf Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine, publishing the article on February 23, 2024. Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) published a fact-check on February 19, 2025, stating that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency.

FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250213-ukraine-europe-must-be-involved-peace-talks-say-nato-european-members-russia-trump-rutte](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250213-ukraine-europe-must-be-involved-peace-talks-say-nato-european-members-russia-trump-rutte)) reported on February 13, 2025, that Scholz warned against a "dictated peace" regarding negotiations between Trump and Putin. <image:k>


## Elaboration
1.  The Euronews fact-check from February 19, 2025, explicitly states that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency.
2.  POLITICO's article from February 23, 2024, indicates Scholz was unaware of Trump's peace plan.
3.  FRANCE 24 reported on February 13, 2025, that Scholz warned against a "dictated peace" in the context of Trump and Putin's negotiations.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Olaf Scholz did not declare a state of emergency in Germany in February 2025. Multiple sources confirm this, and one source indicates Scholz was unaware of Trump's peace plan.

The claim is demonstrably false as it is disproven by evidence from multiple reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A fact-check by Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) explicitly states that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency.
