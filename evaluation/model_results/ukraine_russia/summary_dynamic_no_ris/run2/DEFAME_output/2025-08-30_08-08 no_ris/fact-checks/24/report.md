## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has provided significant aid to Ukraine. The foundation has provided $520 million in humanitarian aid, and is on track to donate $1 billion in aid this year.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has donated over $500 million to Ukraine. The foundation has provided $520 million in humanitarian aid and is on track to donate $1 billion.

The claim is false because it attributes the donations to the wrong person. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Howard Buffett's foundation has provided substantial aid to Ukraine, with approximately $800 million already given and a goal of $1 billion, the claim incorrectly attributes these donations to Warren Buffett. Sources like _Alliance_ magazine ([https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/](https://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/howard-buffett-maintains-ukraine-philanthropy-despite-deteriorating-us-support/)) and Fortune ([https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/)) confirm Howard Buffett's involvement.
