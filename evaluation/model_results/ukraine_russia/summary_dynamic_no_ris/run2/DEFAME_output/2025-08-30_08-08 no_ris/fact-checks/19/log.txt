The claim 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: There is no evidence to support the claim that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni condemned the US-Ukrainian bombing of Russia at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024. While Meloni attended the summit ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_G20_Rio_de_Janeiro_summit)) and commented on the US's position on Ukraine's use of long-range missiles ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/italian-premier-says-she-understands-us-response-to-russia-but-rome-makes-a-different-choice/3398224)), searches did not yield any information about her condemning the bombing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
