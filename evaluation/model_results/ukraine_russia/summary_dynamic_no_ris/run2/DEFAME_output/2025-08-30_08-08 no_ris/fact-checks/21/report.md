### Evidence from `web_search`

One article from MSNBC ([Source](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-fentanyl-response-rcna182496)) mentions her response to Donald Trump's claims about Mexico's role in the fentanyl crisis and her statements on immigration. Another article from workers.org ([Source](https://www.workers.org/2025/02/83990/)) discusses Sheinbaum's statements regarding drug trafficking and the United States' role in it.

Mexico News Daily ([Source](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/trump-sheinbaum-us-anti-drug-campaign/)) reports on Donald Trump thanking Sheinbaum for inspiring a US anti-drug campaign and mentions her statement that the use of fentanyl "is not really a problem" in Mexico. ![image 8114](media/2025-08-30_08-17-1756541878-617411.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation from Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Ukraine. However, the provided sources do not contain the quote attributed to her in the claim. The search results do provide information about Sheinbaum's statements on drug trafficking and the fentanyl crisis, but not the specific quote.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence supporting the alleged quote.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Claudia Sheinbaum declined an invitation to visit Ukraine. However, there is no evidence to support the quote attributed to her in the claim. Since the quote cannot be verified, the claim is considered false. `false`
