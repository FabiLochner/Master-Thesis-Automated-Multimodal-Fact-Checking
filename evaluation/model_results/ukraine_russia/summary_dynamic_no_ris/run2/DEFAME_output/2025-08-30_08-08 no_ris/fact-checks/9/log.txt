Content: The Los Angeles Times published an article on August 22, 2024, stating that Zelensky visited the northeastern Ukrainian border area from which Ukrainian forces launched their offensive into Russia. The article mentions that Zelensky said Ukrainian forces have taken control of another village in the Russian Kursk region. The article also references a previous article from August 15, 2024, where Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had taken full control of the Russian town of Sudzha. The article includes images of Zelensky.

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/russia-belgorod-state-of-emergency-b7fb57c21a43f0f06bf79a4477eb62e9): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article stating that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Ukrainian troops had taken full control of Sudzha. The article mentions that Sudzha is the administrative center for the border area of Russiaâ€™s Kursk region. The article was published on August 15, 2024.

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Ukrainian forces captured Sudzha in August 2024, and Zelensky stated that Ukrainian forces had taken control of Sudzha, there is no evidence to confirm that Zelensky visited Sudzha or met with representatives there.

So, the overall veracity is: false
