## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025, discussing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and ceasefire talks. ![image 5555](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495042-263232.jpg), ![image 5553](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495040-802178.jpg) The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/07/trump-presidency-news/)) also mentions a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at the White House, where Netanyahu commended Trump's partnership, and Trump mentioned the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. <image:k>

The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et)) reports on a meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and US lawmakers at the Capitol, mentioning a plan by Donald Trump for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, which was rejected by Palestinians and leaders around the world. ![image 5568](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495074-188662.jpg) The article also mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu met with President Trump at the White House in April 2025, as stated in the claim. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Netanyahu to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC article mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination countries.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Netanyahu announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria during his visit.

### Evidence from `web_search`
StopFake.org ([Source](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)) states that the claim is a fake, and that social media users misinterpreted a statement made by Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on April 7, 2025. Netanyahu was comparing the situation of Gaza people to those in other war zones, including Ukraine and Syria, where people could leave the country. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/middleeast/israel-palestinians-gaza-displaced-intl)) reports that in August 2025, Netanyahu said that Israel is in talks with several countries about taking in Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza, but does not mention Ukraine or Syria. The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-august-28-2025/)) reports on a meeting at the White House where Ron Dermer stated that Israel does not want to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip or deport Gazaâ€™s residents. ![image 5312](media/2025-08-29_10-05-1756461908-583993.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence clarifies the situation. StopFake.org explicitly labels the claim as false, stating that the original statement was misinterpreted. Netanyahu did not announce plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. Instead, he compared the situation in Gaza to other war zones, including Ukraine and Syria, where people could leave the country. CNN reports that Israel was in talks with other countries about taking in displaced Palestinians, but not Ukraine or Syria.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence shows that the claim misrepresents Netanyahu's statements. He did not announce plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. Instead, he compared the situation in Gaza to other war zones, including Ukraine and Syria, where people could leave the country.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While Benjamin Netanyahu did meet with President Trump at the White House in April 2025, as reported by [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/), he did not announce plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. According to [StopFake.org](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/), the claim is a misinterpretation of his statements.
