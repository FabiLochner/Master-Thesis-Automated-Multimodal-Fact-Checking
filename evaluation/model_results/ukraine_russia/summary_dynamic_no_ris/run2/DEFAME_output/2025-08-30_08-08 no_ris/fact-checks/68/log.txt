The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including ACEC.org and Holland & Knight LLP, indicates that Adam Schiff was assigned to various committees in both the 118th and 119th Congresses, and John Thune was also assigned to committees during the same periods.
