The claim '<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While the web search confirms a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024, the image search did not find the image of destroyed tanks in any of the provided sources, including articles from NBC News.

So, the overall veracity is: false
