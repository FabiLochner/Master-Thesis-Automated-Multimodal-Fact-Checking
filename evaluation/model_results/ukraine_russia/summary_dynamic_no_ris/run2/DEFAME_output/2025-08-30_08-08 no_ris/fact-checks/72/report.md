## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Pete Hegseth, not the US Secretary of Defense, called Putin a "war criminal" on Fox News in March 2022. The evidence also shows that Hegseth has since been more cautious in his statements.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because it misidentifies Pete Hegseth's role. The evidence confirms that Pete Hegseth, not the US Secretary of Defense, made the statement.
