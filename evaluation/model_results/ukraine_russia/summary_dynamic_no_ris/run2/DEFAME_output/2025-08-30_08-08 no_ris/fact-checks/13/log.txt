Useful result: From [Source](https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldeconomicforum/49425251332): 
Content: The World Economic Forum published an image of Volodymyr Zelensky and Klaus Schwab. <image:8089>

The claim '<image:10> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wearing a suit after the large-scale Russian invasion in Ukraine: in a talk with Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum, but the photo was taken on January 22, 2020, in Davos, as confirmed by image search results ([https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukraine_President_Volodymyr_Zelenskyy_and_Klaus_Schwab_at_the_World_Economic_Forum_in_Davos,_22_January_2020.jpg)), which is before the large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.

So, the overall veracity is: false
