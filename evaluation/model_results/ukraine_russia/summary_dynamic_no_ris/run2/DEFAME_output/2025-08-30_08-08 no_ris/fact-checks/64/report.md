France 24 ([Source](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220327-macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher)) reported on March 27, 2022, that Macron warned against escalating the situation after Joe Biden called Putin a "butcher" <image:i>. The Moscow Times ([Source](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/27/macron-warns-against-escalation-after-biden-brands-putin-butcher-a77097)) also reported on the same date about Macron's warning.

Yahoo News UK ([Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/macron-didn-t-call-putin-113000978.html)) states that Macron did not call Putin a "butcher" during a press conference with Donald Trump on February 24, 2025. Instead, Macron referred to the killings of Ukrainian civilians in Bucha in 2022. The Moscow Times also published articles about Trump and Putin on August 6, 2025 ![image 1437](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-322359.jpg), ![image 1438](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-485300.jpg), ![image 1439](media/2025-08-06_19-35-1754508925-668467.jpg).
