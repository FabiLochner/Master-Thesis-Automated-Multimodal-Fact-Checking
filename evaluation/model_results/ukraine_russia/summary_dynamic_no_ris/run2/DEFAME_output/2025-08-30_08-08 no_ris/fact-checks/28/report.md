The evidence confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Donald Trump in March 2025. The letter criticized Trump's treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, the evidence does not mention the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine.

The claim is partially supported, as the letter was written in March 2025. However, the claim's assertion about the letter's content is not fully supported by the evidence.

The information about the suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In March 2025, NPR reported that President Trump paused military aid to Ukraine after a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 8149](media/2025-08-30_08-19-1756541957-269419.jpg)). The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) stated that Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025 and then lifted the freeze shortly after cease-fire talks in Saudi Arabia.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published an analysis on July 25, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's military aid deliveries to Ukraine, including weapons sales and the continuation of aid committed under the Biden administration (![image 8146](media/2025-08-30_08-19-1756541944-677280.jpg), ![image 8147](media/2025-08-30_08-19-1756541945-646677.jpg), ![image 8144](media/2025-08-30_08-19-1756541942-666952.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump paused military aid to Ukraine in March 2025. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) states that Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025.

The claim is supported, as the evidence confirms that Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine in March 2025. The evidence also confirms that Lech Wałęsa wrote a letter to Trump in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Wałęsa's letter criticized Trump's decision to suspend the aid.

The claim is likely true, but it cannot be fully verified without additional information.
