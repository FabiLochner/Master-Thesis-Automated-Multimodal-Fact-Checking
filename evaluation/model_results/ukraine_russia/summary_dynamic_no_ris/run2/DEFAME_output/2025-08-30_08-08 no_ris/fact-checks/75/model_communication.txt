# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Experts told _Newsweek_ that, even if an American PMC were operational in Kursk, it would not equate to Ukraine's raid being conducted under the direction or patronage of the Biden administration, as alleged by the Foreign Ministry.

Helene Olsen, a lecturer in defense studies at King's College London and an expert in the usa of mercenaries and other forms of private contractors in conflict, told _Newsweek_ that it is in the nature of PMCs to "go where the money is."

"While American PMCs traditionally have worked closely with the US Gov and many American PMCs have interests that align with the US Gov, PMCs, irrespective of origin, are ultimately businesses," Olsen said, adding that Russia "would benefit from making up these allegations considering the stigma connected with the private military industry."

According to a release on its website, the ministry expressed its "strong protest" to Holmes "in connection with provocative actions of American reporters who illegally infiltrated Kursk Oblast for propagandist reporting of crimes of Kyiv's regime."

The ministry also claimed to have seen evidence "of the participation of an American \[private military company\] on the side of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the invasion of the territory of the Russian Federation."

 declining to say more than that the operation was "creating a real dilemma for Putin."

According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, however, the involvement of an American PMC in these operations ran "counter to the Biden administration's assertions that it was allegedly not involved in the attack by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on Russia" and that this proved "the United States, as a direct participant in the conflict, is involved in Vladimir Zelensky's malicious plans."

The ministry went on to say that an investigation would be launched into the "American citizens involved in these crimes." It added that those who cross over into Russian territory "automatically become a legitimate military target for the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."

Eugenio Cusumano, associate professor of political science at the University of Messina, Italy, believes that Russia's allegations of American PMC presence in Kursk is "rather unlikely."

"Russia has repeatedly stated [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato)
 soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, German tanks with German crews were captured, a NATO biolab was found under Mariupol, all with no evidence," Cusumano told _Newsweek_.

Even if proven true, he added that the "the scale and impact of US contractors' involvement is most likely minimal," and that the presence of "a private firm serving private objectives" would not constitute America's direct involvement in Kursk.

Keir Giles, senior research fellow at Chatham House's Russia & Eurasia Program, was less skeptical of the Foreign Ministry's claim, given that "large numbers of foreign volunteers are fighting alongside and supporting Ukrainian forces, Americans among them."

However, Giles agreed that PMCs acting under the direction of the U.S. News Reporter

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

*   Russian Foreign Ministry summons US Charge d'affaires in Moscow Stephanie Holmes to convey strong protest against 'provocative actions of American reporters' and 'participation of the American PMCs'   

**MOSCOW** 

Russia protested on Tuesday that US private military companies (PMCs) are fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, while reporters from several major American media outlets illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement that soldiers from US private military companies are fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, and journalists illegally entered Russian territory to cover the incursion.

US Charge d'affaires Stephanie Holmes was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow to convey strong protest against the "provocative actions of American reporters" and "participation of the American PMCs on the side of Ukraine's armed forces during their invasion" of Russia, it said.

"Such actions are contradicting statements by Joe Biden administration about non-involvement in Ukraine's neo-Nazi attack against Russia, proving with all clarity US involvement as a direct participant of the conflict in (Ukraine's President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy's malicious intentions," the ministry stressed.

The ministry warned that Russian law enforcement will investigate US citizens’ actions and take necessary measures to bring them to justice.

"All foreign 'specialists' and mercenaries illegally crossing the border of our country automatically become a legitimate military target for the armed forces of the Russian Federation," it said.

Kyiv's incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6, when Ukrainian forces entered near Sudzha. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

The image search results show that the incursion began on the night of August 5-6. The image shows soldiers with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the U.S. denied these claims.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on March 13, 2025, about Russian forces recapturing Kursk. [<image:2749>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/russian-forces-recapture-kursk-raising-questions-about-us-ukraine-cutoff) The BBC News website contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers.

The Telegraph published an article on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region, including a photograph of Ukrainian servicemen near the Russian border. [<image:2751>](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region)


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Russia claimed American mercenaries participated in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024, and the image shows soldiers with American flags. However, the U.S. denied these claims. Therefore, the claim is not definitively proven.

Arria-formula Meeting on Ukraine
================================

Tomorrow morning (5 August), Russia will convene an [Arria-formula meeting](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-security-council-working-methods/arria-formula-meetings.php)
 titled “The Armed Forces of Ukraine Military Debacle in the Kursk Region: Preliminary Assessment”. Russian officials also [confirmed](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/russia-confirms-north-korean-troops-kursk-rcna203137)
 for the first time in April that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) had provided support for Russia’s war against Ukraine, including the deployment of troops, after the two countries signed a [mutual defence treaty](https://dprknotes.home.blog/2024/06/20/dprk-russia-treaty-on-comprehensive-strategic-partnership-2024-6-19/)
 in June 2024. On 7 July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy [said](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/krok-za-krokom-zakrivayemo-deficit-finansuvannya-na-virobnic-98885)
 that Ukrainian military operations there were still ongoing.

According to the [concept note](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/un-documents/document/arria-formula-meeting-the-armed-forces-of-ukraine-military-debacle-in-the-kursk-region-preliminary-assessment.php)
 prepared by Russia, tomorrow’s meeting is intended to offer member states an opportunity to examine the “political and humanitarian consequences” of Ukraine’s Kursk incursion. The concept note claims that Ukraine’s incursion was assisted by “foreign mercenaries” and involved “severe violations of international law, including the summary execution of civilians, attacks on ambulances and looting”. Russia may reiterate its allegations that Ukrainian soldiers and foreign mercenaries have committed war crimes in its Kursk region. Maxim Grigoriev, a member of the Russian Civic Chamber and Chairman of the International Public Tribunal on Ukraine, which was established by the Russian Civic Chamber in March 2022, is expected to brief. OHCHR has noted that Ukrainian and Russian authorities confirmed that thousands of people had been evacuated on both sides of the border due to escalating hostilities in the area.

In late April, Russian authorities [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx26166ngpdo)
 that their forces had regained full control of the Kursk region, a claim that Kyiv has rejected. In January, Ukrainian and US officials [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/world/europe/north-korea-troops-ukraine-russia.html)
 the New York Times that DPRK troops “have been pulled off the front lines after suffering heavy casualties”, while noting the possibility that they may return in the future after receiving additional training."

* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:24> This image shows American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:24>)
image_search("American mercenaries Ukraine Russia Kursk Oblast")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Ukraine': 0.69, 'Russia': 0.26, 'Estonia': 0.02, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on March 13, 2025, about Russian forces recapturing Kursk. [<image:2749>](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/13/russian-forces-recapture-kursk-raising-questions-about-us-ukraine-cutoff) The BBC News website contains an image of Ukrainian soldiers. [<image:2750>](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984g10e22lo)

The Telegraph published an article on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region, including a photograph of Ukrainian servicemen near the Russian border. [<image:2751>](https://www.ukrainianphotographers.com/en/news-articles/foreign-mercenaries-in-the-kursk-region)


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it was most likely taken in Ukraine or Russia. The image search results provide context, including an article from The Telegraph on August 14, 2024, about Ukraine seizing land in the border region. This aligns with the claim's timeframe of August 2024. The presence of an American flag on the soldiers' uniforms, as seen in the image, supports the claim of American involvement.

However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the individuals in the image are mercenaries. The Telegraph article mentions Ukrainian servicemen, but it does not specify their nationality. Further information is needed to confirm the claim that the individuals are American mercenaries.

The evidence does not provide information about the incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reported on August 16, 2024, about Russia's claims of American soldiers and mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region. [<image:3404>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3401>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) [<image:3403>](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-protests-american-soldiers-kursk-1942273) The Russian Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. and claimed to have evidence of American PMC involvement, which the U.S. denied. Anadolu Agency reported on August 20, 2024, that Russia protested the presence of US mercenaries fighting alongside Ukraine in the Kursk region, with the Russian Foreign Ministry claiming US private military companies (PMCs) were fighting alongside Ukrainian troops. [<image:2749>](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russia-formally-protests-us-mercenaries-joining-ukrainian-soldiers-in-kursk-region-/3308755) The incursion into the Kursk region began on the night of August 5-6.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Newsweek and Anadolu Agency reported on Russian claims of American mercenaries participating in Ukraine's incursion into the Kursk region in August 2024. The image search results show that the incursion began on the night of August 5-6. The image shows soldiers with American flags on their uniforms, which aligns with the claim. However, the U.S. denied these claims.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

web_search("New Zealand Food Bill gardening ban")
```

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
geolocate(<image:26>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.

Geolocated footage confirmed that Ukrainian forces had advanced at least 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) across the Russian border, having penetrated at least two Russian defensive lines and a stronghold. She said that Ukraine would be conducting humanitarian operations in the area, that international humanitarian organizations would be allowed to enter, and that [safe corridors](/wiki/Humanitarian_corridor "Humanitarian corridor")
 would be opened for civilians to evacuate toward Ukraine or to other parts of Russia.[\[330\]](#cite_note-332)

On 7 September, [Kyrylo Budanov](/wiki/Kyrylo_Budanov "Kyrylo Budanov")
 noted that the offensive into Kursk had impacted and "complicated" Russian plans for an offensive in the upcoming winter.[\[331\]](#cite_note-ISW_September_7-333)

On 13 September, Zelenskyy acknowledged the Russian counter-attack but claimed there had been "no serious (Russian) success", adding that "It gave the results that, frankly speaking, we counted on" and reiterated claims that it had adversely affected Russian operations in Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts.[\[332\]](#cite_note-334)
[\[333\]](#cite_note-335)
[\[187\]](#cite_note-ISW_2024_09_13-189)

 to inspect areas of Kursk Oblast that were under its control.[\[334\]](#cite_note-336)

### United States

The [White House](/wiki/White_House "White House")
 said that it was seeking an understanding from Ukraine regarding the incursion, adding that it had no advance knowledge of the attack.[\[52\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera_Third_Day-54)
 On 8 August, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary [Sabrina Singh](/wiki/Sabrina_Singh "Sabrina Singh")
 stated that the incursion is consistent with the US policy on the use of weapons.[\[335\]](#cite_note-politico_20240809-337)
 On 12 August, [US National Security Council](/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council "United States National Security Council")
 spokesperson [John Kirby](/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral) "John Kirby (admiral)")
 called on Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine if he "doesn't like" the Ukrainian incursion in Kursk Oblast.[\[336\]](#cite_note-338)
 On 13 August, President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
 said that the Ukrainian incursion was "creating a real dilemma" for Putin.[\[337\]](#cite_note-339)

### Germany

In response to the Kursk offensive, the German Foreign Ministry stated on 9 August that weapons transferred from Germany to Ukraine become the property of Ukraine and can be used by its armed forces as they deem necessary and correct. Finally, on the strategic level, to slow Russia's offensive momentum, to shift the narrative and counter Russian talking points about their inevitable victory, and also to boost Ukrainian morale.[\[355\]](#cite_note-357)

Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 (RUSI), said that the Ukrainian incursion into Russia was "the first on this scale with conventional forces, rather than proxies \[or\] 'resistance' groups." He also assessed that [earlier raids into Kursk and Belgorod](/wiki/March_2024_western_Russia_incursion "March 2024 western Russia incursion")
 were designed to probe for Russian weak spots, and that the overall goal of the raid is to dismantle Russia's ability to funnel more troops into the [Kharkiv front](/wiki/2024_Kharkiv_offensive "2024 Kharkiv offensive")
 and that "It's unlikely that the plan is to seriously take Kursk itself, or to try and hold vast swathes of Russian territory."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 BBC journalists noted the overall decrease of Russian attacks on the Ukrainian frontline at around 15–17% after the beginning of Kursk raids, which could be the sign of Russia taking forces from the frontline into Kursk Oblast.[\[356\]](#cite_note-358)

[Nico Lange](/wiki/Nico_Lange "Nico Lange")
, former chief of staff at the German [Federal Ministry of Defence](/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_Defence_(Germany) "Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)")
, stated that the incursion was likely "to establish a [negotiating position](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 and provide relief on other front lines" and that it is unlikely that Ukrainian forces would hold territory in Kursk for long periods of time.[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)
 Retired Polish General and former commander of special forces, [Roman Polko](/wiki/Roman_Polko "Roman Polko")
, stated that "It's good that Ukraine is taking actions that surprise the Russians," and that "Ukraine is in a defensive position and is unable to conduct an operation to push Russia from the occupied regions, but Ukraine is defending itself in an active way," and that "One can't allow the Russians to comfortably prepare new attacks."[\[79\]](#cite_note-Politico_August_8-81)

Political analyst [Andreas Umland](/wiki/Andreas_Umland "Andreas Umland")
 suggested that the offensive could bring a quicker end to the war. For other attacks by Ukraine-aligned forces, see [Attacks in Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine](/wiki/Attacks_in_Russia_during_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Attacks in Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine")

Revealed: Russia anticipated Kursk incursion months in advance, seized papers show
==================================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

**Exclusive:** Documents contain months of warnings about possible Ukrainian advance and also reveal concerns about morale

Russia’s military command had anticipated Ukraine’s incursion into its Kursk region and had been making plans to prevent it for several months, according to a cache of documents that the Ukrainian army said it had seized from abandoned Russian positions in the region.

The disclosure makes the disarray among Russian forces after Ukraine’s attack in early August all the more embarrassing. The earliest entries are dated late in 2023, while the most recent documents are from just six weeks before Ukraine launched its incursion into the Kursk region on 6 August.

The documents mostly come from units of Russia’s 488th Guards Motorised Rifle Regiment, and in particular the second company of its 17th Battalion.

Ukraine’s incursion into Kursk took Kyiv’s western partners and many in the Ukrainian elite by surprise, as planning had been restricted to a very small number of people. But Russian military documents contain months of warnings about a possible incursion into the area and an attempt to occupy Sudzha, a town of 5,000 residents that has now been [under Ukrainian occupation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/07/ukraine-sudzha-russian-town-kursk-region)
 for more than a month.

An entry from 4 January spoke of the “potential for a breakthrough at the state border” by Ukrainian armed groups and ordered increased training to prepare to repel any attack. It recounts an incident that reportedly took place on 20 January this year, when a conscript soldier entered the summer washing area at a guard post and shot himself in the abdomen.

“The investigation into the incident determined that the cause of the suicide and death was a nervous and psychological breakdown, caused by his prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army,” reads the handwritten report of the incident.

To prevent further such incidents, unit commanders are instructed to identify soldiers who “are mentally unprepared to fulfil their duties or prone to deviant behaviour, and organise their reassignment and transfer to military medical facilities”.

Further instructions on keeping up morale come in an undated, typed document that explains that soldiers should get 5-10 minutes a day as well as an hour once a week of political instruction, “aimed at maintaining and raising the political, moral and psychological condition of the personnel”.

A Ukrainian armoured personnel carrier in the Sumy region, near the border with Russia’s Kursk region, on 17 August. On 19 February, unit commanders were warned of Ukrainian plans for “a rapid push from the Sumy region into Russian territory, up to a depth of 80km \[50 miles\], to establish a four-day ‘corridor’ ahead of the arrival of the main Ukrainian army units on armoured vehicles”.

In mid-March, units at the border were ordered to boost defensive lines and “organise additional exercises for the leadership of units and strongpoints regarding the proper organisation of defences” in preparation for a Ukrainian cross-border attack.

In mid-June, there was a more specific warning of Ukrainian plans “in the direction Yunakivka-Sudzha, with the goal of taking Sudzha under control”, which did indeed happen in August. The June document complained that Russian units stationed at the front “are filled only 60-70% on average, and primarily made up of reserves with weak training”.

When the Ukrainian attack came on 6 August, many Russian soldiers abandoned their positions, and within a week Ukraine had taken full control of Sudzha. The parents of one conscript soldier from the second company, featured in the documents, recorded a [tearful video appeal](https://t.me/mobilizationnews/19909)
 in August, identifying him as their 22-year-old son Vadim Kopylov, saying he had been taken prisoner near Sudzha and calling on Russian authorities to exchange him.

The documents give an insight into Russian tactics over the past year, in one case speaking of the need to create decoy trenches and positions to confuse Ukrainian reconnaissance drones."

No effect on the Pokrovsk front
-------------------------------

There was also increasing evidence that Moscow was having trouble stopping the Ukrainian counterinvasion in Kursk and was increasingly tapping elite units to do so.

Russian military reporters and geolocated footage have revealed that elements of the 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades, the 11th Airborne Brigade, and the 51st and 56th airborne regiments were redeployed to fight in Kursk.

The 810th and 155th naval infantry brigades had been fighting in Kharkiv, where Russia launched a new incursion in May. Sarantsev admitted that the Kursk action had had no effect on the Pokrovsk front.

Published On 29 Aug 202429 Aug 2024

Ukraine’s deep strikes against Russian military targets and its three-week-old ground offensive inside Russian territory have appeared to be yielding military and political results during the past week.

Russia was reported to be moving its aircraft back from airfields near the Ukrainian border while glide bomb attacks inside Ukraine were reported to have decreased. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week said it was a preemptive defence to prevent another Kharkiv-type invasion in the north.

But he also told Ukrainians it was “a way to compensate for the deficit in long-range capabilities”.

For months, Zelenskyy has implored the United States to allow Ukraine to use the [ATACMS long-range rocket artillery](/news/2024/8/23/which-countries-weapons-is-ukraine-using-in-russia-incursion)
 it provides to strike airfields deep inside Russia. He also wants the US to release Britain and France, for whose Storm Shadow missiles the US provides components, to authorise their use in the same way.

Currently, the US allows Ukraine to use its weapons to counter battery fire within a limited range across the border but not to hit Russian airfields because it is afraid that this could draw the US into the war.

(Al Jazeera)

In a recent analysis, the ISW identified that “at least 209 of 245 (more than 85 percent) known Russian military objects in range of ATACMS are not air bases” but ammunition depots, communications centres, army bases and command centres.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Monday that restrictions on the use of long-range weapons remain in place but “we’ll keep the conversations with the Ukrainians going” to potentially revise them.

The European Commission, which does not command military assets, has openly supported a lifting of restrictions.

The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, [repeated that support](/news/2024/8/29/eus-borrell-urges-ukraine-backers-to-lift-curbs-on-arms-use-inside-russia)
 on Monday and Thursday. He also wants to bind EU allies closer in a joint air defence, a defensive measure that wouldn’t provoke Russia, he said, and has already been implemented in protecting Israel from a massive Iranian missile and drone attack on [April 13-14](/news/2024/4/14/iran-attacks-israel-with-over-300-drones-missiles-what-you-need-to-know)
.

After Russia fired 127 missiles and launched 109 Shahed drones into Ukraine on Monday, one of its largest ever aerial attacks targeting energy and civilian infrastructure, Zelenskyy said: “We must finally come to the joint shooting-down of Russian missiles and drones. Life has the same value everywhere.”

Zelenskyy said he had discussed such a joint aerial defence with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrid Shimonite and Polish President Andrej Duda in Kyiv on August 24.

While Ukraine seeks expanded authority and cooperation from its allies, it is also going its own way. It is believed prototypes of this missile may have been used against Russian-occupied Crimea in August 2023 to [destroy two S-400](/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit)
 air defence systems. Evidence that Moscow was scrambling elite units from Ukraine to defend home turf also mounted during the week.

An unnamed White House official told the Politico news website that “90 percent of the planes that launch glide bombs” against Ukrainian front-line positions had been moved back inside Russia.

(Al Jazeera)

The independent analysis website Frontelligence agreed that “between the second half of June and mid-July, Russian forces relocated many valuable assets away from the Ukrainian border,” including planes and helicopters.

Ukrainian Colonel Vitaly Sarantsev told a joint news telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels that the Kursk offensive had greatly reduced Russia’s use of aviation against northeastern Ukraine.

“We felt relief in tactical aviation,” he said on Sunday. If so, that would be a significant proportion of the more than 700,000 soldiers Russia is estimated to have in Ukraine.

The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank, estimated that Russia would need 60,000 soldiers to win back territory in Kursk once Ukrainian defences were dug."

## Claim
Claim: "<image:26> This image shows destroyed Ukrainian tanks during Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed Ukrainian tanks Kursk Oblast August 2024")
geolocate(<image:26>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) published an article about the second battle of Kursk, including an image of a tank (<image:6630>). Al Jazeera published an article on August 16, 2024, about Russia eliminating a Ukrainian unit, also including an image of a tank (<image:6631>). NBC News published an article about the evacuation of Belgorod and Kursk, which also contains an image of a tank (<image:6632>).

The provided sources do not contain the image of destroyed Ukrainian tanks (<image:26>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.08, 'Turkey': 0.08, 'Bhutan': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.06, 'Ukraine': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Colombia': 0.04, 'Montenegro': 0.04}

## Elaboration
The image search did not find the image in question. The geolocation search suggests that the image could have been taken in Russia, but the probability is low.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the context of the destroyed tanks.
