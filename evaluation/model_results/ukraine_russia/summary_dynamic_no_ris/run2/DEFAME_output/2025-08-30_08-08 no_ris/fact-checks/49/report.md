## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A video and still images falsely claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs. The video was published in September 2024, and Zelenskyy's handwritten messages on the shells reference Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza. Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania and signed some of the shells. ![image 16](media/49.jpg)

The Fox News article discusses Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing a missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in President Bidenâ€™s hometown. Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz was also present. The article also mentions that the missile was signed with Josh Shapiro. ![image 966](media/2025-08-06_18-19-1754504384-791630.jpg) ![image 992](media/2025-08-06_18-19-1754504395-425717.jpg)
