## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Howard Buffett's foundation, not Warren Buffett, has provided significant aid to Ukraine. The foundation aims to surpass $1 billion in giving this year, with approximately $800 million already contributed since the full-scale invasion, according to a report from April 7, 2025, published by Fortune ([https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/](https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/warren-buffetts-son-is-on-track-to-donate-1-billion-in-aid-to-ukraine-this-year-and-pledges-to-continue-despite-trumps-shaky-relations/)).
