### Evidence from `web_search`
CBS News ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-netanyahu-meeting-dc-israel-hamas-war-gaza-ceasefire/)) reports on a meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House in April 2025, discussing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and ceasefire talks. ![image 5555](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495042-263232.jpg), ![image 5553](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495040-802178.jpg) The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/07/07/trump-presidency-news/)) also discusses a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, mentioning the U.S. pushing for a ceasefire deal in Gaza. <image:k>

The BBC ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg4zwwez9et)) reports on Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with US lawmakers at the Capitol. The BBC also mentions Donald Trump's plan for a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, and John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza. ![image 5568](media/2025-08-29_19-17-1756495074-188662.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Benjamin Netanyahu visited the White House in April 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention any plans by Netanyahu to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. The BBC mentions John Bolton suggesting the possibility of resettlement for Palestinians in Gaza, but it does not specify the destination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Netanyahu announced plans for the resettlement of Palestinians to Ukraine and Syria.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
StopFake.org states that the claim that Benjamin Netanyahu proposed to resettle Gaza residents to Ukraine and Syria is a fake, explaining that Netanyahu's statement was misinterpreted, comparing the situation of Gaza people to those in war zones like Ukraine and Syria, where people could leave the country ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)). ![image 5312](media/2025-08-29_10-05-1756461908-583993.jpg)

CNN reports that Netanyahu is in talks with several countries about taking in displaced Palestinians, including South Sudan, Somaliland, Ethiopia, Libya, and Indonesia, but not Ukraine or Syria ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/middleeast/israel-palestinians-gaza-displaced-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/middleeast/israel-palestinians-gaza-displaced-intl)). <image:k> The Times of Israel reports on a meeting at the White House regarding the future of Gaza, where Ron Dermer stated that Israel does not want to permanently occupy Gaza or deport its residents ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-august-28-2025/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-august-28-2025/)). <image:k> The Times of Israel also mentions Netanyahu meeting with Druze leaders and discussing military actions in Syria, and that Netanyahu told WFP chief McCain that Israel will redouble efforts to boost Gaza aid. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly labels the claim as a fake, stating that Netanyahu's statement was misinterpreted. CNN reports that Netanyahu was in talks with other countries about taking in displaced Palestinians, but not Ukraine or Syria. The Times of Israel also confirms that Israel does not want to deport Gaza residents.


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed that Netanyahu did visit the White House in April 2025, but did not provide any information about the claim. The second search provided evidence from StopFake.org, CNN, and The Times of Israel, which all indicate that the claim is false. StopFake.org explicitly states that the claim is a fake, and CNN reports that Netanyahu was in talks with other countries about taking in displaced Palestinians, but not Ukraine or Syria.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Benjamin Netanyahu did visit the White House in April 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that he announced plans to resettle Palestinians in Gaza to Ukraine and Syria. In fact, sources like StopFake.org ([https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/](https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-proposed-to-resettle-gaza-residents-to-ukraine-and-syria/)) explicitly debunk the claim, and CNN reports that Netanyahu was in talks with other countries, but not Ukraine or Syria, regarding the resettlement of displaced Palestinians.
