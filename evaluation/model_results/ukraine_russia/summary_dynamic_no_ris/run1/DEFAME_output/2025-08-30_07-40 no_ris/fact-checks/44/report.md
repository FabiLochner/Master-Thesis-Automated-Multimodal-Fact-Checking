## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that President Biden made remarks regarding Hurricane Helene on September 30, 2024, and that he visited North Carolina. However, the provided sources do not mention any announcements about stopping aid for the affected areas or providing additional aid to Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Biden made the specific announcements mentioned in the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html): 
Content: The Yahoo News article, published on October 10, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Biden said no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. The article states that Biden did not say this and that he later said more aid would be forthcoming. The article references a White House transcript of Biden's remarks on September 30, 2024, where he said he would be asking Congress for a supplemental aid bill. The article also mentions an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine announced on September 26, 2024. ![image 7608](media/2025-08-30_07-51-1756540269-908843.jpg), ![image 7616](media/2025-08-30_07-51-1756540278-862729.jpg)


## Elaboration
The Yahoo News article fact-checks the claim and states that Biden did not say no more aid would be given to Hurricane Helene victims. Instead, he said more aid would be forthcoming and would ask Congress for a supplemental aid bill. The article also mentions an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine announced on September 26, 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that President Biden did not announce that no more aid would be provided for areas affected by Hurricane Helene. Instead, he stated that more aid would be forthcoming and that he would ask Congress for a supplemental aid bill. The evidence also mentions an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine announced on September 26, 2024, but this does not align with the claim's specific details.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Based on the fact-check, the claim is false. President Biden did not announce a halt to aid for Hurricane Helene victims; instead, he stated that more aid would be provided and requested a supplemental aid bill. While an $8 billion military aid package for Ukraine was announced on September 26, 2024, this does not support the specific details of the claim. The [Yahoo News article](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-biden-didnt-hes-done-162918340.html) confirms this.
