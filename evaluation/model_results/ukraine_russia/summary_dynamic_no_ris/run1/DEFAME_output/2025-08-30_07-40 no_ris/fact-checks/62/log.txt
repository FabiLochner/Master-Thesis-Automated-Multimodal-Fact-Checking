The claim '<image:20> This image shows a US drone which was shot down in March 2025 by the Houthis using Russian missiles.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not verifiable. While the Houthis have shot down US drones using Russian-made missiles, the image's geolocation suggests it was taken in Israel, and there is no evidence to link the image to a specific drone downing incident by the Houthis.

So, the overall veracity is: false
