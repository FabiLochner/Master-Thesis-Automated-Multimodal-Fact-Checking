## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations states that Ukraine has become the top recipient of U.S. aid since the Russian invasion in February 2022. In late 2024, the United States provided the Ukrainian government with a $20 billion loan. President Donald Trump froze all military aid to Ukraine in early March 2025, and then lifted the freeze shortly after. The article does not mention the total amount of military aid provided to Ukraine as of February 2025. [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine)

NPR reported on August 5, 2025, that the U.S. has provided around $75 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in 2022 (![image 494](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502171-020535.jpg), ![image 496](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502173-562939.jpg), ![image 497](media/2025-08-06_17-42-1754502174-952586.jpg)). The CSIS published an article on February 11, 2025, discussing the Trump administration's boost to military aid deliveries to Ukraine (![image 503](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502186-411462.jpg), ![image 502](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502185-652269.jpg), ![image 501](media/2025-08-06_17-43-1754502184-885543.jpg)). The article mentions the administration's announcement of weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a BBC article published on November 15, 2024, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025, according to the Kiel Institute. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate. ![image 3178](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853512-728986.jpg), ![image 3180](media/2025-08-22_09-05-1755853514-364342.jpg)

USAFacts reported that the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. The BBC reported that the US had spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense stated that $184.8 billion had been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. Furthermore, the BBC Verify concluded that Donald Trump's claim of over $300 billion spent was inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is inaccurate. Multiple sources provide figures for military aid to Ukraine that are significantly lower than $350 billion as of February 2025. The BBC and USAFacts provide figures that contradict the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the BBC and USAFacts indicates that the total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine was significantly less than $350 billion as of February 2025. The BBC reported that the US had spent $130.6 billion between January 2022 and June 2025, and the US Department of Defense stated that $184.8 billion had been "appropriated" as of March 2025. Furthermore, the BBC Verify concluded that a claim of over $300 billion spent was inaccurate.
