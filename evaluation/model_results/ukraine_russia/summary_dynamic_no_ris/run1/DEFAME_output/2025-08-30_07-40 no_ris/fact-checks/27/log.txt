Content: The OCCRP published an article on October 3, 2021, revealing that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his inner circle were beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies. The Pandora Papers show that Zelensky and his partners in comedy production owned a network of offshore companies related to their business based in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize. Zelensky handed his shares in a key offshore company over to Serhiy Shefir around the time of his 2019 election, but the two appear to have made an arrangement for Zelenskyâ€™s family to continue receiving money from the offshore. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/much-volodymyr-zelenskyy-worth-160047933.html): 
Content: The article, published on April 24, 2022, by AOL, discusses Volodymyr Zelenskyy's net worth. It states that Zelenskyy's financial disclosure from 2018 listed total assets worth 37 million hryvnias. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Zelenskyy is worth roughly $1.5 million, not $1.5 billion. Zelenskyy's monthly income as president is $930. <image:1936>

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy owns 15 homes including a $35 million home in Florida, has $1.2 billion in an overseas bank account, owns 15 homes, three private planes and has a monthly income of $11 million.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checks from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-facts-behind-resurfaced-231800640.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/change-during-the-russia-ukraine-war/) show that Zelenskyy's assets and income are significantly lower than what the claim states. His real estate holdings are worth around $4 million, and his net worth is less than $30 million.

So, the overall veracity is: false
