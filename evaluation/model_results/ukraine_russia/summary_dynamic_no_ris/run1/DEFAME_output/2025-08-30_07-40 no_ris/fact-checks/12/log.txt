The claim '<image:9> This is an authentic image of world leaders taking off their suits to symbolically support Ukraine at the London summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the London Summit on Ukraine on March 2, 2025, did occur, images from Reuters, Al Jazeera, and Le Monde show that the European leaders were wearing suits, not taking them off as the claim suggests.

So, the overall veracity is: false
