## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss historical conflicts involving Japan, Russia, and China. One article from Wikipedia ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria)) details the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945, including the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party and war crimes committed by Soviet soldiers. Another article from Britannica ([Source](https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchuria/Manchuria-since-c-1900)) discusses the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) and the imperialist expansion in Manchuria.

A Warfare History Network article ([Source](https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/the-soviet-invasion-of-manchuria-led-to-japans-greatest-defeat/)) focuses on the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945, which led to Japan's defeat, and mentions the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union in 1938. <image:k>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 7767](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540751-778728.jpg), ![image 7765](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540750-666785.jpg)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Kremlin's website ([Source](http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/77864)) highlights the strong relationship between Russia and China, emphasizing historical friendship and cooperation. Kyodo News ([Source](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/05/2273370ce1bc-china-russia-leaders-statement-avoided-wording-that-could-irk-japan.html?phrase=Germany&words=)) discusses a joint statement between China and Russia that avoided wording that could "irk Japan," and mentions Japan's concerns over joint military exercises between China and Russia. RFE/RL ([Source](https://www.rferl.org/a/military-exercise-japan-taiwan-navy-china-russia-partnership/33491860.html)) reports on joint naval exercises between China and Russia, and Japan's concerns about growing tensions. ![image 7795](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540798-101220.jpg), ![image 7796](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540798-359031.jpg), ![image 7800](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540799-667943.jpg), ![image 7801](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540799-817708.jpg), ![image 7794](media/2025-08-30_07-59-1756540797-914908.jpg), ![image 7810](media/2025-08-30_08-00-1756540803-435991.jpg), ![image 7811](media/2025-08-30_08-00-1756540807-618273.jpg)


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates a strong relationship between China and Russia, with the Kremlin emphasizing historical friendship and cooperation ([Source](http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/77864)). Joint statements between China and Russia have been carefully worded to avoid upsetting Japan ([Source](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/05/2273370ce1bc-china-russia-leaders-statement-avoided-wording-that-could-irk-japan.html?phrase=Germany&words=)). Japan has expressed concerns about joint military exercises between China and Russia ([Source](https://www.rferl.org/a/military-exercise-japan-taiwan-navy-china-russia-partnership/33491860.html)).

The evidence suggests that China and Russia are strengthening their relationship, which causes concern for Japan. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade Russia.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results reveal historical conflicts and current geopolitical dynamics. While there is evidence of a strong relationship between China and Russia, and Japan's concerns about this relationship, there is no evidence to support the claim that China and Japan plan to invade Russia.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals historical conflicts between Japan, China, and Russia, but the evidence does not support the claim. Current reports highlight a strong relationship between China and Russia, causing concern for Japan, but there is no evidence of a planned invasion.
