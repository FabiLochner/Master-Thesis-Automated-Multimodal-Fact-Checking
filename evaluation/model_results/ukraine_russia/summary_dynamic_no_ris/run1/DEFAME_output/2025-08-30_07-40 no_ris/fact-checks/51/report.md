## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
POLITICO reports that Olaf Scholz was unaware of Donald Trump's peace plan for Ukraine before its announcement. ([https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/)) Euronews fact-checked claims that Scholz declared a state of emergency, stating that he referred to an urgent situation ("Notlage") and not a state of emergency ("Notstand"). ([https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/19/fact-check-scholz-did-not-call-for-german-state-of-emergency-over-russia-us-peace-talks)) FRANCE 24 reported on European leaders' reactions to Trump's negotiations with Putin, with Scholz warning against a "dictated peace."

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Euronews fact-checked the claim and found that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency ("Notstand"). Instead, he referred to an urgent situation ("Notlage"). Furthermore, POLITICO reports that Scholz was unaware of Trump's peace plan before its announcement.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources confirm that Scholz did not declare a state of emergency and was unaware of Trump's peace plan. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
