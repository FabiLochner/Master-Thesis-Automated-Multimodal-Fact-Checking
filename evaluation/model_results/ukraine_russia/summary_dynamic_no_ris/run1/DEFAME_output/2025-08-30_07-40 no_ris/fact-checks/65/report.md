Content: CNN reports that US Vice President J.D. Vance said the US could use economic and military "tools of leverage" against Russia if they don't negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, published on February 14, 2025, US Vice President J.D. Vance discussed potential US actions against Russia. However, the evidence specifies that Vance mentioned the use of economic and military "tools of leverage" rather than explicitly stating that military action was available.

The CNN report, written by Jessie Yeung, indicates that Vance's statements were related to the possibility of using leverage if Russia did not negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine in good faith. The evidence does not provide the exact wording Vance used regarding military action.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that J.D. Vance made statements about potential US actions against Russia in a Wall Street Journal interview published on February 14, 2025. The evidence suggests that Vance mentioned the use of economic and military "tools of leverage" rather than explicitly stating that military action was available.
