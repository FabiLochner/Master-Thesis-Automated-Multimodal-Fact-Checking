### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/europe/poland-military-parade-europe-clout-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/europe/poland-military-parade-europe-clout-intl)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/16/poland-holds-huge-military-parade-as-war-rages-in-neighbouring-ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/16/poland-holds-huge-military-parade-as-war-rages-in-neighbouring-ukraine)) reported on a military parade in Poland. The Al Jazeera article was published on August 16, 2023.

The BBC also published an image of a military parade in Poland ([https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-66515585](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-66515585)). The CNN article includes an image of tanks ![image 7957](media/2025-08-30_08-05-1756541111-855264.jpg), and Al Jazeera also shows an image of tanks ![image 7958](media/2025-08-30_08-05-1756541112-353764.jpg). The BBC also published an image of the parade ![image 7959](media/2025-08-30_08-05-1756541112-557920.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a military parade in Poland on August 14, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm that Poland held a military parade on August 15, 2024, as part of Armed Forces Day celebrations, which began on August 14. The image search results show that tanks were part of the parade.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state the purpose of the parade was to prepare for war with Russia. The parade is described as an expression of strength and a celebration of Armed Forces Day.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a military parade in Poland, which took place on August 15, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations. The parade included tanks and other military hardware. However, the claim that the parade was preparing for war with Russia is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a military parade in Poland on August 15, 2024, as part of the Armed Forces Day celebrations, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and Polish Radio ([https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade](https://www.polskieradio.pl/395/7784/artykul/3413138,poland-set-for-massive-military-parade)). While the parade included military hardware, the claim that it was preparing for war with Russia is not supported by the evidence.
