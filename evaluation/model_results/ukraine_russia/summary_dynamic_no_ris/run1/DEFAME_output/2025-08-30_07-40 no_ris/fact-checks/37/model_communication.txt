The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.

In short:
---------

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris welcomed the three Americans released in the prison swap as their plane touched down in Maryland. 

Mr Biden thanked the collective effort of the countries involved in the major international swap. 

What's next?
------------

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

US President Joe Biden has welcomed home the three Americans who were sentenced to years in Russian penal colonies after secret "sham" trials and now free under a major East-West prisoner swap. 

Mr Biden and Kamala Harris met the plane carrying detainees that landed in the United States on Thursday, local time, in Maryland. 

The president stressed the importance of diplomacy and praised the collective effort of Washington's allies in the multinational deal.

"Alliances make a difference," he said. 

"They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.

"I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia," Mr Biden said. 

Vice-President Harris said it was "an extraordinary day".

"You can see it in the families, in their eyes and in their cries."

They were both serving sentences on spying charges that the US says were false.

Also released was Alsu Kurmasheva, a reporter for a US-funded radio network in Europe, who was last month jailed for six and a half years for "spreading false information" about the Russian military.

British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize winner who had written for the Washington Post, was also freed. He said Buenos Nochas."

Earlier on Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the prisoner exchange, said that traitors to his country should rot and die in prison, but that it was more useful for Moscow to get its own people home.

"And let the traitors now feverishly adopt new names and actively disguise themselves under witness protection programmes," Mr Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

Six countries release at least one prisoner 
--------------------------------------------

Russia also received three men charged by federal authorities in the US, including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. 

Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being in a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges.

"Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world," Mr Biden said earlier.

All told, six countries released at least one prisoner.

The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the US to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offences. 

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing in a letter: "We know the US government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice."

Though she called for a change to the dynamic, "for now," she wrote, "we are celebrating the return of Evan."

The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The swap was coordinated by Türkiye, its intelligence agency said, and the American and German prisoners were taken to its capital, Ankara, before they were able to return home.

Eight Russians — who were being held in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia — were released too. I will see you again, we will talk about your future." 

On Friday, the Kremlin said Vadim Krasikov was an employee of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and had served in Alpha Group, the FSB's special forces unit.

Among those also released to Moscow was a Russian family, the Dultsevs and their two children, whom a court in Slovenia convicted of pretending to be Argentinians in order to spy on the EU and NATO member state.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the couple were "illegals" — deep-cover agents trained to impersonate foreigners, who spend years living abroad in their cover identities.

"The children of the 'illegal' intelligence agents who flew in yesterday only learnt that they were Russian after the plane took off (for Moscow) from Ankara," Mr Peskov told reporters.

"Before that, they didn't know that they were Russian and that they had anything to do with our country. And you probably saw that when the children came down the plane's steps that they don't speak Russian and that Putin greeted them in Spanish."

### Evidence from `web_search`
On August 1, 2024, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed three Americans freed by Russia at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, as reported by CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-prisoner-swap-biden-harris-welcome-paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-prisoner-swap-biden-harris-welcome-paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/)) <image:7512>, <image:7513>. ABC News also reported on August 2, 2024, that Biden welcomed home the three Americans released in a prisoner swap with Russia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-02/biden-meets-with-freed-americans-in-major-russia-prisoner-swap/104174404](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-02/biden-meets-with-freed-americans-in-major-russia-prisoner-swap/104174404)) <image:7525>, <image:7526>, <image:7527>.

The U.S. Air Force also provided photos of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris welcoming the three Americans at Joint Base Andrews on August 1, 2024 ([https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3860680/americans-released-from-russian-custody-arrive-at-joint-base-andrews/](https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3860680/americans-released-from-russian-custody-arrive-at-joint-base-andrews/)) <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that on August 1, 2024, President Biden welcomed the freed Americans upon their arrival. The Times of India reported that Biden entered an empty plane after the arrival of the freed Americans on August 3, 2024, but the White House clarified that he did so to thank the flight crew.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate as multiple sources confirm that President Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans arrived. `true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is accurate. Multiple sources, including The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-joe-biden-enter-empty-plane-carrying-russian-prisoners-white-house-clarifies/articleshow/112249634.cms)), reported that President Biden boarded a plane after the arrival of freed Americans.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/20/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-its-war-with-russia-as-trump-claims): 
Content: "You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. ![Donald Trump](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-20T032938Z_1960498084_RC22YCAIM23O_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1740037743.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

“I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it’s going very well,” [Trump said](/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)
, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the US, the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world’s third-largest, for security guarantees.

But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.

Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally number two but was widely considered the country’s ultimate centre of power.

He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.

As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W Bush that “Ukraine is not a country”."

### Invasion plans

The [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 reported that Russia's plan involved defeating Ukraine within ten days and capturing or killing its government, followed by ["mopping up" operations](/wiki/Zachistka "Zachistka")
; establishing [filtration camps for Ukrainians](/wiki/Russian_filtration_camps_for_Ukrainians "Russian filtration camps for Ukrainians")
; setting up occupation regimes; executing people involved in the Revolution of Dignity; and lastly annexation.[\[107\]](#cite_note-RUSI_invasion_plan-110)
[\[108\]](#cite_note-KyivPost_invasion_plan-111)

 [Sergei Shoigu](/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu "Sergei Shoigu")

After the start of the invasion, Ukrainian and Western analysts tentatively assessed that Putin seemed to have assumed that the Russian Armed Forces would be capable of capturing the Ukrainian capital city of [Kyiv](/wiki/Kyiv "Kyiv")
 within days. Briefings from Western officials had also become more pessimistic about Ukraine's military situation.[\[344\]](#cite_note-telegraph-20241030-347)

Russia’s UK ambassador falsely claims Zelenskyy started Russia-Ukraine war

#### Andrei Kelin

Russian Ambassador to the UK

"Zelenskyy said he would quickly make peace with Russia, but instead, he started a war."

[Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gve08si3Oaw&t=989s "Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025")

False

On Feb. By 2019, when Zelenskyy won the presidency, the war had been ongoing for five years.

**Key events:**

*   **2014:** Russia annexed Crimea, and covert Russian forces seized government buildings in Donbas, escalating tensions.

*   **2015:** Putin signed the Minsk agreements, which were designed to solidify Russian control over eastern Ukraine.

*   **2019:** Zelenskyy was elected president, vowing to end the war but refusing to concede to Russia's demands.

*   **2022:** Putin launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. <image:2119>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference after the "Support Ukraine" summit, marking the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Feb. 24, following months of disinformation campaign and military buildup, dismissing global warnings.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Russia controlled parts of eastern Ukraine as early as May 2014.

**Conclusion:** Russia, not Ukraine, initiated the conflict, which escalated significantly in 2022 with Putin’s full-scale invasion.

From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025): 
Content: "Russia has leveled some Ukrainian cities as it has attacked and occupied them, such as Mariupol.\[4\] Cities throughout the 80 percent of Ukraine that Russian forces have not occupied have remained largely intact during Russia's invasion, apart from deliberate Russian strikes against critical and civilian infrastructure.\[5\]

**Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections in wartime (unlike the US Constitution, which requires it).**

Ukraine's Constitution prevents the Ukrainian government from holding elections or amending the constitution in times of martial law.\[6\]

Russia triggered Ukraine's martial law provisions when it launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government cannot constitutionally suspend martial law while Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition politicians, including those who have historically run against Zelensky, have stated that holding elections under martial law would be both illegal and immoral.\[7\]

**Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses.**

Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses by any reliable estimate, either in terms of civilian or military casualties.

Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion, and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action.\[8\]

US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000, but no reputable source places casualty estimates near or in the millions.\[9\]

The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.\[10\]

**Europe provides about as much direct aid to Ukraine as the United States.**

Europe (including European Union \[EU\] members and EU institutions plus Norway and the UK) has overtaken the United States in terms of cumulative direct (military and non-military) aid allocations to Ukraine (not counting the costs of US forces forward-deployed in Eastern Europe).\[11\]

*   Europe has provided Ukraine with a total of $166 billion in cumulative aid and pledged an additional $34.7 billion to be allocated through 2030.\[12\]
*   Europe has provided and pledged approximately $204.1 billion in all — over $174 billion from the EU, $13.9 billion from Norway, and $16.2 billion from the UK — compared to America's $183 billion.\[13\]
*   These figures do not include the EU and G7 commitments to provide loans to Ukraine financed by income generated from frozen Russian assets.

**European loans to Ukraine are backed by income from frozen Russian assets, not Ukraine.**

The EU is contributing $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that are backed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not Ukraine.\[14\]

*   The EU holds approximately $220.5 billion in Russian frozen assets.\[15\]
*   The EU has already made available $1.6 billion for Ukraine from immobilized Russian assets and disbursed $3.2 billion in loans in January 2025.

**Ukraine did not misuse or lose half of the aid the United States has provided.**

The majority of the funds the United States has allocated for Ukraine stays in the United States to fund domestic defense industrial base and replenish US stockpiles.\[16\]

US government agencies closely oversee the remaining US aid, which is directly issued to Ukraine. <image:3606>**](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UKR%20support%20fact%20sheet%2C%20February%2021%2C%202025%20PDF%201.pdf)

**Zelensky does not imminently risk losing all of Ukraine.**

Russian forces currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukraine, leaving the remaining 80 percent of the country under Ukraine's sovereign control.

At the current rate of advance, it would take Russian forces over 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine, assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely.

Russia's rate of advance on the frontline has slowed significantly over the past three months.\[1\]

Russian forces are making small territorial gains at the cost of massive personnel losses.\[2\]

Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 27.94 square kilometers per day in November 2024, 18.1 square kilometers per day in December 2024, and 16.1 square kilometers per day in January 2025.\[3\]

**Most Ukrainian cities have not been destroyed.**

Many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa, have avoided destruction and continue to function. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Office of the Inspector General reported on January 11, 2024, that it had found no evidence of misappropriated aid.\[17\]

**Ukraine repeatedly invited Putin to negotiate in early 2022.**

Zelensky proposed to meet with Putin on February 19, 2022 — just five days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\[18\] Putin ignored this request and invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\[19\]

Zelensky called for direct talks with Putin "in any format" in March 2022 and offered to compromise on Ukraine's accession into NATO.\[20\] The Russians demanded the full surrender and demilitarization of Ukraine.\[21\]

Zelensky also expressed openness to discussing the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on the condition that the Ukrainian people would ratify any deal through a referendum.\[22\] Putin rejected that offer as well.

From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: "More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.

Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.

Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

> Increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.

Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. The first examines Russian objectives and the Russian way of war in Ukraine. 
 

**The Russian Way of War**
--------------------------

Vladimir Putin’s primary objective is likely to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence, either directly by militarily conquering and annexing Ukraine or indirectly by installing a Russian ally in Kyiv."

Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Of course, this list is not exhaustive, as not every death is publicly reported.

To build a more complete picture of the war’s true toll, we have developed an estimate based on excess male mortality, using data from the national Probate Registry. The data from the very end of the year sits on the edge of where our model’s accuracy begins to decrease.

However, this surge is clear to see in a reliable indicator: the ratio of probate cases opened for men compared to those for women, as female mortality has not been affected by the war.

! They are, however, visible in the mortality estimate.

By the start of August, Russian courts had received **around 50,000 such** **military-related claims**."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting estimates regarding Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war as of February 2025. While some sources suggest figures around the claimed 1.5 million, others provide significantly lower numbers. The term "lost" is also ambiguous, as it could refer to killed, wounded, or missing. Due to the lack of a definitive figure for February 2025 and the conflicting information, the claim cannot be fully verified. `not enough information`

Mediazona ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), in an article updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also notes a peak in male mortality in November 2024, with approximately 3,000 deaths per week.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties to control four regions of Ukraine ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). However, the Russia Matters report card from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured as of January 2025.

Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 were killed by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The Center for Strategic and International Studies indicates that Russian fatalities are extraordinarily high, exceeding those of previous conflicts ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)).

The claim's veracity depends on whether "lost" refers to casualties (killed, wounded, missing) or only killed. The evidence provides different estimates, and the exact number of losses as of February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

### Evidence from `web_search`
As of August 21, 2025, the Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)) states that a British Army official estimated that Russia would suffer 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions of Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine War Report Card from Russia Matters, dated February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured as of January 2025, with 48,000 missing (<image:k>).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). The fact sheet mentions that Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. The fact sheet is available for download (<image:3605>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025.

Mediazona's estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)) is significantly lower. The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.

The claim's accuracy depends on the definition of "lost" (killed, wounded, missing) and the specific timeframe. The available data does not provide a definitive answer.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.
