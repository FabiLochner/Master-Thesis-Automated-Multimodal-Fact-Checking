###### [Ukraine’s F-16 jets intercept Russian missiles in apparent first](/global/europe/2024/08/27/ukraines-f-16-jets-intercept-russian-missiles-in-apparent-first/)

###### Russia fired dozens of missiles and drones across Ukraine on Tuesday, including some that officials said were shot down by Western-supplied F-16 jets.

The Defense Ministry has opened an investigation into the crash.

Earlier Thursday, Russia conducted a heavy aerial attack on Ukraine for the third time in four days, again launching missiles and scores of drones that mostly were intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said.

Russian forces fired five missiles and 74 Shahed drones at Ukrainian targets, an air force statement said. Four of those Russian missiles were shot down by F-16s, the statement said.

The crash was the first reported loss of an F-16 in Ukraine, where they arrived at the end of last month. The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces destroyed three Ukrainian [sea drones](https://www.militarytimes.com/unmanned/2024/03/06/the-sea-drone-thats-lifting-ukraine-morale-as-it-hunts-russian-ships/)
 aimed at the Black Sea peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

The Russia-installed governor of Sevastopol Mikhail Razvozhayev added that four Ukrainian aerial drones and three sea drones were destroyed “at a significant distance” from the peninsula’s shore.

In the meantime, Ukraine’s Army General Staff acknowledged Thursday Ukraine’s involvement in strikes this week on oil depots deep inside Russia, where blazes broke out.

The attacks in the Rostov and Kirov regions were part of Ukraine’s effort to disrupt logistical infrastructure supporting Russia’s war machine.

Ukraine F-16 jet crashes during Russian attack, killing pilot
=============================================================

By Illia Novikov, The Associated Press

 Aug 29, 2024

! officials told The Associated Press at the end of last month that the first of a batch of F-16s promised by European countries [had arrived](https://www.militarytimes.com/global/2024/08/01/first-group-of-us-made-f-16-jets-arrive-in-ukraine-officials-say/)
 in Ukraine.

KYIV, Ukraine — One of the handful of F-16 warplanes that Ukraine has received from its Western partners to help fight Russia’s invasion has crashed, Ukraine’s Army General Staff said Thursday. The pilot died.

The fighter jet went down Monday, when Russia launched a major missile and drone barrage at Ukraine, a military statement posted on Facebook said. That number is dwarfed by the Russian jet fighter fleet, which is around 10 times larger.

Ukraine [needs at least 130](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-offensive-aid-16e276766b7100485fe97b674700ac6c)
 F-16 fighter jets to neutralize Russian air power, Kyiv officials say.

U.S. But Ukrainian officials welcomed them as offering an opportunity to hit back at Russia’s air superiority.

Ukraine has until now been using Soviet-era warplanes, and its pilots underwent intense training on the F-16s in the West for months."

. While it may have been a crewed fighter, the Ukrainian Air Force is also responsible for long-range surface-to-air missiles that have previously taken a toll on Russian aircraft operating in their own airspace.

According to unverified claims, which appear to have first been published in the German newspaper _Bild_, the Su-35S was shot down by an F-16. <image:2865>

*   Ukrainian drones set several oil tanks on fire at the **Glubokinskaya oil depot in the Kamensky district of Russia’s Rostov region**, several Russian Telegram channels monitored by Reuters reported on Wednesday. Russian officials regularly say damage was **caused by debris** from a drone that was shot down, **rather than admitting** that the drone hit its target.
    
*   The governor of Russia’s **Belgorod** region – which **borders Ukraine and partly Ukrainian-occupied Kursk** – said he was aware of reports that the Ukrainian army had tried to cross the border. He claimed Russian forces had redeployed about 30,000 troops because of the Kursk incursion, and that Ukraine had taken **594** **PoWs** there, [write Luke Harding and Pjotr Sauer](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/27/russia-ukraine-war-kryvyi-rih-zaporizhzhia-strikes-blackouts)

*   The **Kursk nuclear plant** is especially vulnerable because it **does not have a good enough roof over its reactor**, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday. Rostov’s governor, Vasily Golubev, said several Ukraine-launched drones were destroyed over the region, which lies across the border from Ukraine’s Luhansk oblast. The Baza channel, which is close to Russia’s security services, said **three tanks were burning after strikes by two drones**.
    
*   The attack came while tanks were still on fire at another Rostov oil depot, in the Proletarsk district, 10 days after the depot was attacked, Russian Telegram channels report."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Defense News reports that a Ukrainian F-16 jet crashed during a Russian attack in August 2024, killing the pilot. The War Zone discusses claims about a Ukrainian F-16 shooting down a Russian Su-35S Flanker, mentioning the death of Ukrainian F-16 pilot Oleksiy Mes during a Russian aerial barrage in August 2024. The Guardian published an article on August 28, 2024, discussing the Ukraine war, mentioning that Volodymyr Zelenskiy stated that F-16s were used to shoot down Russian missiles.

The articles include images of F-16s <image:2853>, <image:2852>, <image:2865>, and <image:2868>, and a downed Su-35 <image:2862>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that F-16s have been involved in the conflict in Ukraine, with at least one Ukrainian F-16 crashing in August 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the image shows a US F-16 shot down over the Black Sea after refusing Russian orders. The evidence mentions Ukrainian F-16s, not US ones. The image itself is not identified in the evidence.

The claim is therefore not supported by the evidence.

The claim is missing information about the origin of the F-16 in the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Russian Federation’s Attack on Ukrainian Children’s Hospital ‘Not Only a War Crime’ but ‘Far Beyond the Limits of Humanity’, Medical Director Tells Security Council
====================================================================================================================================================================

‘There Has Been No Respite for Civilians in Ukraine’, Says Humanitarian Official

Amid a wave of the Russian Federation’s deadly missile attacks, targeting multiple cities across Ukraine on 8 July — including a strike that hit the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in Kyiv — the United Nations top humanitarian official warned against a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health-care and other civilian infrastructure.

“There has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine”, said Joyce Msuya, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, adding that she was “shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”.  In Kyiv, the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital were severely damaged, and its toxicology department — where children receive dialysis — was destroyed.  “Russia started this war and Russia can end it at any time”, she underscored, reaffirming support for Ukraine.

The representative of the United Kingdom said that, in its repeated attacks against Ukraine since 23 February 2022, the Russian Federation has killed, maimed and abducted Ukrainian children.  Further, on 8 July, it attacked a children’s hospital. “This is cowardly depravity, and this must stop”, she underscored, stating that the intentional direction of attacks against civilian populations and objects constitutes a war crime. Stressing that Moscow’s conduct “is a disgrace to the Security Council and, especially, to the President’s seat”, she urged those present to jointly condemn the Russian Federation’s actions. For its part, the United Kingdom and its partners “will continue to ensure Ukraine is able to defend itself from these barbaric acts of violence” and — at the ongoing summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — “will demonstrate our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes”.  Moscow must end its aggression against Ukraine and withdraw its forces.  “And stop killing Ukrainian children”, she added.

The representative of Japan lamented that the Council met “once again to confront the grim reality” caused by the Russian Federation’s escalating attacks across Ukraine, including a barrage of missiles that caused serious damage and many casualties at a pediatric hospital in Kyiv.  She wished that the children there would get prompt and appropriate care.  The Office for the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) is verifying figures while rescue workers, hospital staff and volunteers continue to clear rubble in search of people trapped under debris. Health officials report that what remains of the children’s hospital is without electricity, preventing the use of ventilators and other urgent care.  UN Human Rights staff has helped move child patients to other facilities while providing psychosocial support and assisting with other urgent needs. She also highlighted “a massive outpouring of solidarity” from local residents, who rushed to the scene to help remove rubble and provide blankets, water and food for patients and medical staff. Furthermore, at least seven civilians were killed at the ISIDA medical centre in Kyiv — one of Ukraine’s largest women’s health and family planning centres — when debris from an intercepted missile hit the facility.

“Intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”, she asserted, adding that these incidents are part of a deeply concerning pattern of systematic attacks harming health care and other civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. Attacks have intensified since the spring of 2024.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022.  Multilateral efforts that preserve diplomatic frameworks are the best way to achieve concrete solutions, he said.

The representative of Malta, noting that the Okhmatdyt National Children’s Specialized Hospital is a beneficiary of the technical cooperation programme run by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that the missile attack against it “not only endangers lives, but also constitutes a violation of IAEA’s core principles and values”.  Health and educational facilities “must always be protected” to ensure uninterrupted delivery of their services to all people in Ukraine, she stressed, calling for the immediate cessation of all attacks against hospitals, residential buildings and critical infrastructure in Ukraine and on all parties to adhere to their obligations under international law.  The attacks on 8 July took place amidst Moscow’s new military offensive in the Kharkiv region, but attacks throughout 2024 have endangered the lives of thousands of children, health-care workers and civilians. Against that backdrop, she stressed: “The perpetrators of these actions must be held accountable for the damage done.”

The representative of Mozambique said that civilian deaths, both intentional and incidental, must not be condoned, urging warring parties to exercise maximum restraint and avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  The respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law must be upheld under any circumstance.  Okhmatdyt Hospital was just one of many targets in the heavy missile strike which hit Kyiv and other cities on 8 July, he said, noting that the Russian Federation launched 38 missiles, attacking almost 100 civilian sites.  Noting that the World Health Organization (WHO) has verified 1,878 attacks affecting health-care facilities, personnel, transport, supplies and patients since February 2022, she asserted that “intentionally directing attacks against a protected hospital is a war crime, and perpetrators must be held to account”.

Describing the 8 July attack on the children’s hospital, Volodymyr Zhovnir, the Director of Okhmatdyt, said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  “At 10:42 a.m.  Describing the 8 July attack on the facility, he said that at 9:52 a.m., when air raid sirens sounded, the hospital staff began evacuating patients to the bombshell shelter.  Noting ongoing negotiations regarding Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee deep in children's blood in the chair’s seat here?”  The representative of the Russian Federation will bypass purgatory and end up in hell forever, he said, calling on the Council to respond to that country’s aggression and war crimes as well as address the issue of its presence in the permanent seat of the Soviet Union.

The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that the Russian Federation’s recent large-scale missile attacks are “a stark reminder” of why the Russian Federation Armed Forces are listed by the UN as a perpetrator of grave violations against children.  He stressed: “By targeting Okhmatdyt — a symbol of Ukraine’s childcare medicine — Russia once again demonstrates its cruelty and its utter insincerity about peace talks.”  Further, he pointed to the “striking paradox” of a Member State currently holding the presidency of the Council — the organ responsible for maintaining peace and security — while intensifying, “as we speak”, attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  Citing an OHCHR report documenting Moscow’s targeting of energy infrastructure and use of “double-tap” strikes, he stressed:  “These are the facts.”

Against that backdrop, he underscored that the Russian Federation and its leadership must be held fully accountable for waging a war of aggression and for other serious international crimes — “as well as for the massive damage caused by their war”.  The General Assembly will soon vote on a resolution regarding the threats posed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, as this marks the first time in history that a nuclear power plant — Europe’s largest — has been illegally seized by a foreign aggressor.  “History matters here”, he stressed, stating that history — including the 1986 Chernobyl disaster — teaches the existential importance of nuclear safety and security. “Russia’s irresponsible actions place all of us at risk, and that is why we hope — and expect — that all UN Member States will support this initiative”, he urged.

The representative of Poland said that the Russian Federation forces have targeted the largest Ukrainian nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia, the largest Ukrainian water dam in Khakovka and now Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in Kyiv.  He cited estimates by media experts that the Kremlin spent as much as $250 million on Monday’s missile barrage against targets in several Ukrainian cities.  Instead of using the money to treat their own children, Moscow “prefers to spend hundreds of millions on killing children in Ukraine”.  “We must move from the logic of domination and force to the logic of diplomacy and the peaceful solution of the conflict”, he said.

Along similar lines, the speaker for Sierra Leone underlined that the devastating impact of the reported overnight missile strikes on civilians is a stark reminder of the urgent need for the violence to end and a renewed commitment to protecting civilian lives and infrastructure in conflict zones.  “It also begs for independent investigations”, he said, urging the involved parties to “choose and prioritize peace”.

On 8 July, Moscow deliberately targeted “perhaps the most vulnerable and defenceless group in any society — children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses”, said Ukraine’s delegate.  Holding up images of the missile’s flight trajectory, as well as pictures of missile fragments retrieved from under the hospital, he said the footage shows that the hospital was a deliberate target.  Turning to ongoing negotiations regarding the Summit of the Future, he asked:  “What kind of future are we talking about if the murderer is sitting knee-deep in children’s blood in the Chair’s seat here?”

Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, Council President for July, spoke in his national capacity to counter that a missile from the Ukrainian air defence hit the children’s hospital in an attempt to intercept a Russian missile that was meant to hit a factory.  He pointed out that this tragedy — which falls within the pattern of Ukrainian and Western propaganda — occurred on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit.  “If this was a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building and all the children would have been killed and not wounded”, he said, emphasizing that Moscow does not strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Briefings

JOYCE MSUYA, Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said that, since June, “there has been no respite for civilians in Ukraine” amid continuing waves of attacks across the entire country.  “I was particularly shocked by yesterday’s deadly missile strikes on Kyiv, Kryvi Rih, Pokrovsk, Dnipro and other urban centres”, she stated.  These attacks struck vital energy infrastructure, as well as two of the country’s leading specialist hospitals for children and women."

A massive [missile](/wiki/Missile "Missile")
 attack on Ukraine occurred on 8 July 2024 during the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")

 came under fire from more than forty missiles of the [Russian military](/wiki/Russian_military "Russian military")
.[\[8\]](#cite_note-FT07082024-8)
 In total, at least 47 people were killed and about 170 were injured.[\[9\]](#cite_note-BBC_cd162vj804go-9)
[\[10\]](#cite_note-kyiv_independent_200-10)
 In Kyiv, strikes damaged residential buildings and infrastructure, notably including the [Okhmatdyt](/wiki/Okhmatdyt "Okhmatdyt")
 children's hospital, the country's largest, which killed two adults.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

 The international community condemned the attacks. Presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
 stated that calls for an "immediate ceasefire" by [Hungary](/wiki/Hungary "Hungary")
 and [China](/wiki/China "China")

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The attack resulted in severe damage and casualties. The provided image shows a scene of destruction, with rubble and what appears to be children's toys.

The claim suggests that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as forensic analysis of the image or eyewitness accounts.

The articles can be found here: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/kyiv-children-hospital-hit-as-russia-fires-barrage-of-missiles-on-ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/kyiv-children-hospital-hit-as-russia-fires-barrage-of-missiles-on-ukraine).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The attack resulted in severe damage and casualties. The provided image shows a scene of destruction, with rubble and what appears to be children's toys.

The claim suggests that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as forensic analysis of the image or eyewitness accounts.

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour published an article about a Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital (<image:7435>). Al Jazeera also reported on the Kyiv children's hospital attack on July 8, 2024 (<image:7436>).

The articles can be found here: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-missile-attack-hits-ukrainian-childrens-hospital-amid-bombardment-dozens-killed) and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/kyiv-children-hospital-hit-as-russia-fires-barrage-of-missiles-on-ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/kyiv-children-hospital-hit-as-russia-fires-barrage-of-missiles-on-ukraine).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The attack resulted in severe damage and casualties. The provided image shows a scene of destruction, with rubble and what appears to be children's toys.

The claim suggests that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as forensic analysis of the image or eyewitness accounts.

Remarks
=======

by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the President of the United States of America, Donald J. Which is totally logical, and this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO Summit, the 5% but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.

  
So based on that, that was Europe stepping up. So if I was Vladimir Putin today, and are you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days, and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. Trump at the White House
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   14 Jul. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you do want Europeans to pay for it. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada: They all want to be part of this.

And this is only the first wave. There will be more.

So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need. So if we can make packages, of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the US will keep on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country, that's absolutely clear.

But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc, etc. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them.

So I really want to thank you for that, and it means Europeans paying for it.

And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the US later, backfilling it, because speed is of the essence here.

So really, thank you this is important.

MOSCOW and KYIV — President Trump on Monday threatened to punish Russia with heavy tariffs on countries that trade with Moscow if the Kremlin fails to reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine by September, while promising Kyiv billions of dollars worth of military equipment.

"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days," Trump said during a White House meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. "Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs."

It was his latest warning against Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Trump becomes increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin leader over his continued war in Ukraine.

President Trump explained that NATO countries would acquire U.S.-made weapons, including Patriot air defense missile systems, and that those countries would provide them to Ukraine.

Speaking Sunday to reporters ahead of the meeting with Rutte, Trump cast the weapons deals as a direct rebuke to Putin. <image:1883>

 a sanctions on/off switch to use as snap leverage with Moscow.

Collectively, the moves cap a stark turnaround in Trump's approach toward President Putin over the Ukraine issue. Trump's frustrations with Russia today might be directed at Ukraine tomorrow.

"Why should they ruin relations completely?" Sergey Poletaev, of the Moscow-based Vatfor analytical platform, said in an interview with NPR.

"In another six months or so, the pendulum could swing back the other way."

"The fact remains that the supply of weapons, ammunition and military equipment from the United States continued and continues to Ukraine," Peskov told reporters.

Russia's main market index jumped on the news that Trump would delay additional sanctions for at least 50 days, during which Trump said he expected Russia to negotiate a peace deal.

Yet several prominent Russian nationalists seized on that timeframe, saying it provided Russia a new deadline for a battlefield victory.

Still, political observers in Moscow recalled the Kremlin is dealing with a mercurial American president. Trump has gone from initially promising he could leverage his personal relationship with Putin to negotiate a quick peace agreement, to now openly criticizing the Kremlin leader as unserious in negotiations to end the war.

While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. leader announcing plans to sell NATO allies weapons that it can pass on to Ukraine.

In a statement, NATO said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.

[! Trump teased last week that he would make a "major statement" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces. 

The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after [pausing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-halting-some-weapons-shipments-ukraine/)
 some weapons shipments.

"We're going to send some more weapons. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine." 

Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.

Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for "congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer" that will "go after" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and "all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine."

"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine," Graham said. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.

The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine."

This has been a familiar dynamic for the administration; in early July, the White House announced it would freeze the delivery of some weapons intended for Ukraine. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-nato "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)")
 and European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government has received most, but not all, of the funding in the five U.S. supplemental appropriations bills passed since the invasion.

A large share of the money in the aid bills has been spent in the United States, paying for American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or that replenish the U.S. cities.

While much is unclear about the new policy, it appears NATO member states will send weapons from their stockpiles to Ukraine and buy U.S. Separately, the Trump administration this week announced weapons sales to Ukraine totaling $652 million under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, adding to the $310 million in FMS approved in May. The Trump administration policy appears to keep in place the military aid committed under the Biden administration, which is set to deliver around $30 billion over the next three-and-a-half years.

The visit of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House for talks aimed at ending the war has put the scale of United States (US) support for Ukraine under the spotlight again.

President Donald Trump has criticised the amount of aid provided by the US compared to Europe in the past. But the figures he's previously cited are not backed by the evidence.

BBC Verify has been taking a close look at how much the US has spent since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and how it compares with Europe's contribution.

How much has the US spent in total?
-----------------------------------

The US has spent a total of $130.6bn (£98.9bn) between 24 January 2022 and 30 June 2025, [according to the Kiel Institute](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/ukraine-support-tracker-data-20758/)
, a Germany-based think tank that tracks international support for Ukraine.

The US Department of Defense has provided its own figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - [a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0k4389g2o)
.

It says [$184.8bn has been "appropriated"](https://www.ukraineoversight.gov/Funding/)
 - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.

This total runs only to 31 March 2025, making it less up to date than the Kiel Institute's calculation - though notably higher.

BBC Verify has asked the US departments of Defense and State if they can supply more recent figures.

What has Trump previously claimed?
----------------------------------

Back in February, when he was hosting France's President Macron, Trump claimed:

"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference"

! It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.

Will Europe get its money back while the United States doesn't?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Trump has previously claimed Europe would get its money back as it was "loaning" it to Ukraine.

This prompted Macron - who was sat next to the US president in their Oval Office meeting in February - to intervene, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.

President Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures specifically on financial aid. But the institute's figures also suggest President Trump has a point - the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.

However, again, there are different figures out there.

As of 18 July, [the EU says its members have provided about $180bn so far](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253)
, with loans making up 35% of the total.

Like the United States Department of Defense, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.

EU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute.

Between January 2022 and the end of June 2025, Europe as a whole spent $165.7bn on Ukraine, compared to the US's $130.6bn over the same period, according to Kiel Institute calculations.

The figure includes aid directly from the European Union (EU), but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.

What we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been [a mixture of loans and grants](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20241017IPR24736/parliament-approves-up-to-EU35-billion-loan-to-ukraine-backed-by-russian-assets)
.

How much has the UK given to Ukraine
------------------------------------

The UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (£2.3bn) loan agreement signed during Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.

At the end of July, [the UK government had committed $29.5bn (£21.8bn) for Ukraine overall](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet/uk-support-to-ukraine-factsheet)

How much has the US given to Ukraine?

BBC Verify looked at the claim at the time and [concluded Trump's numbers did not add up](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cddy92025gdo)
 as the published numbers - from both Kiel and the US government - showed the US had spent a lot less than $300bn.

This remains the case six months on.

How does US spending compare to Europe?
---------------------------------------

It is true that the US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. This includes $17.6bn (£13bn) in military support.

The only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.

However, the UK's contributions are much smaller than the US

That raises a question for the UK and other European countries: if peace is not secured in the near future and US decides to withdraw a large part of its funding, can other states make up the difference?

That would require a significant increase in their current contributions.

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The BBC published an article on November 15, 2024, discussing the amount of military aid the US has given to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute, the US has spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. <image:3178>, <image:3180>. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate.

 to send Ukraine $45.8 billion in equipment, more than one quarter the aid total.

Most of US aid to Ukraine has been security assistance.

### **How much economic and humanitarian assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Economic governance and development support accounts for another 24% of aid, or $44.2 billion. According to OAR, services in Ukrainian cities have improved overall since 2024, leaving fewer people in need of humanitarian assistance, but have worsened in regions close to the Russian border, where humanitarian aid is still required.

Another 2% of the aid budget has been allocated to operations for the agencies involved in coordinating the effort, including oversight on spending.

**How much of the total federal budget has gone towards Ukraine response?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The federal government spent [$20.1 trillion](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/)
 from fiscal years 2022 to 2024, so the $182.8 billion in Ukraine allocations would amount to less than 1% of the budget.

In 2024, the most recent complete fiscal year, $66.9 billion was allocated. For context, the total budget of the [Federal Highway Administration](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-transportation/)
 in FY 2024 was $61.1 billion.

### **Will Ukraine have to pay the US back?**

A portion of the military aid will have to be repaid, though the US has yet to establish a definitive timeline.

In May 2022, President Biden signed the [Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3025302/biden-signs-lend-lease-act-to-supply-more-security-assistance-to-ukraine/)
, authorizing the US military to provide Ukraine and other Eastern European countries with equipment as a loan. When Congress allocates funding, it specifies amounts to different US agencies based on their functions.

Of emergency aid for Ukraine since 2022, Congress has allocated:

*   68% ($123.9 billion) to the [Department of Defense](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-defense/)
     (DOD)
*   22% ($39.9 billion) to the [US Agency for International Development](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
     (USAID)
*   6% ($11.6 billion) to the [State Department](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-state/)
    
*   4% ($7.4 billion) to other agencies including the International Development Finance Corporation, [Department of Health and Human Services](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-health-and-human-services/)
    , [Treasury](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-the-treasury/)
    , and [Department of Energy](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-department-of-energy/)
    

Congress has allocated $182.8 billion to Ukraine response since 2022.

Those agencies commit some or all those funds by awarding contracts to beneficiaries in Ukraine and the region. Those funds are paid over time, and they can expire —when Congress allocates funds, it can choose to specify a timeline.

Of the $182.8 billion allocated since the invasion, $140.5 billion has been committed, $83.4 billion has been spent, and $2.7 billion has expired and won’t be paid out.

45.6% of the $182.8 billion allocated to Ukraine response since 2022 has been spent.

**What types of aid are there?**
--------------------------------

All foreign aid responding to the invasion of Ukraine fits in one of four categories: security assistance, economic aid for governance and development, humanitarian aid, and operations.

### **How much security assistance has the US provided Ukraine?**

Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. The law requires repayment but defers repayments from Ukraine indefinitely — they’re not required to start paying immediately but they will have to at some point, with interest.

This is not an uncommon aid approach: the [Lend-Lease Act](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/lend-lease-act)
 supported the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, France, China, and other allies during World War II, providing military equipment but suspending payments during the conflict.

._

! But “allocated” means the money is available, not that it’s been spent: So far, the United States has actually disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment, some of which Ukraine will have to repay with added interest.

Aid for Ukraine goes through a cross-agency operation called [Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR)](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, which began after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 to deter Russian aggression against [NATO](https://usafacts.org/articles/what-is-nato-and-what-does-it-cost-to-be-a-member/)
. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the operation shifted focus to address the needs of Ukraine and other partners.

**How does foreign aid allocation work?**
-----------------------------------------

The funding allocated for Ukraine supports Ukraine, American partners affected by the war, and US national security programs. Much of this goes straight to the Ukrainian government for anti-corruption programs, [pursuing justice for Russian crimes against Ukrainians](https://media.defense.gov/2025/Feb/13/2003646507/-1/-1/1/OAR_Q1_DEC2024_FINAL_508_2.PDF)
, repairs to damaged energy and agriculture infrastructure, and to fund health and education services, among other initiatives.

The US has allocated 2% of funding to address what OAR leadership calls a “significant humanitarian crisis” caused by the war, including humanitarian support within Ukraine (administered mostly by [USAID](https://usafacts.org/explainers/what-does-the-us-government-do/agency/us-agency-for-international-development/)
) and for refugees across the region (administered mostly by the State Department). How much money has the US given Ukraine since Russia’s invasion?
================================================================

Since February 2022, the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region.

Updated March 14, 2025 by the [USAFacts team](/editorial-guidelines/)

The US Department of Defense says $184.8 billion has been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. The article also mentions that Donald Trump claimed the US had spent over $300 billion, which the BBC Verify concluded was not accurate. <image:3178>, <image:3180>

USAFacts reported that the United States has allocated $182.8 billion in emergency funding to support Ukraine and the region since February 2022. Security assistance accounts for 71% of all Ukranian allocations since 2022, totaling $130.7 billion. As of December 2024, the US has disbursed $83.4 billion in funding and equipment. The article was updated on March 14, 2025.


## Elaboration
The claim that the United States had given $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine as of February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. The BBC reported that the US had spent a total of $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025. The US Department of Defense stated that $184.8 billion had been "appropriated" as of March 31, 2025. Furthermore, the BBC Verify concluded that Donald Trump's claim of over $300 billion spent was inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is inaccurate. Multiple sources provide figures for military aid to Ukraine that are significantly lower than $350 billion as of February 2025. The BBC and USAFacts provide figures that contradict the claim.

`false`

## Summary

**US philanthropist Howard Buffett has kept up funding Ukraine with informal arrangements, even amidst deteriorating relations between the two nations since President Donald Trump’s election into office.** 

The son of billionaire Warren Buffett and longtime Republican Party supporter made his 18th visit to Ukraine in three years via a train trip in April, underscoring his funding support. 

Buffett told the Associated Press that Trump’s apparent closeness with Russia and clampdown on military support for Ukraine has not altered his foundation’s support in Ukraine. 

‘It doesn’t change anything we do. Howard Buffett maintains Ukraine philanthropy despite deteriorating US support 
===============================================================================

! We’re on track,’ he said. 

Howard Buffett’s foundation aims to surpass the $1 billion giving mark this year for Ukraine. 

So far, the Buffett Foundation has provided $800 million in aid and funding towards clearing mines and boosting agriculture and local infrastructure. A similar trip is expected in May. 

In a video posted by the Associated Press, Buffett was joined by Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko. The pair have established close relations, with Svyrydenko describing Buffett as ‘one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.’ 

Buffett also scorned the possibility of a peace deal, calling it ‘impossible’ given Trump’s pivoting towards the Kremlin and Putin’s reluctance. 

“At the end of the day, I think the US will do the right thing, but it may be a painful process and there may be a lot more Ukrainians that die,” he said.

Ukraine’s agricultural sector has lost 20.5 per cent of farmland since the full-scale invasion in February 2022.  

And some 139,000 square kilometres of land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined. Two-thirds of that is fertile farmland belonging to Ukrainian farmers who have sowed wheat for generations. 

The foundation also funded bipartisan trips for US lawmakers to visit Ukraine in 2023."

 As uncertainty in U.S.–Ukraine relations grows, informal ties with some U.S. Buffett, a Republican and son of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. We’re on track,” Buffett told The Associated Press, adding that his foundation will surpass $1 billion in aid to Ukraine this year. So, we’ll stick with it as long as we need to.”

The AP caught up with Buffett aboard a train with Ukraine’s Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko on Saturday. Svyrydenko calls him “one of the greatest friends of Ukraine.”

Buffett is [among a number of Americans](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-be08b99bf75e99de991557ac18c7bf15)
 across the U.S. hasn’t done enough to help Ukraine defeat Russia over the past few years.

On this trip, Buffett and Svyrydenko traveled to the country’s northern Sumy region, where the situation has significantly worsened following Ukrainian forces’ loss of ground in Russia’s Kursk region.

They visited the villages of Popivka and Bobryk, which — like much of the region — lie in a high-risk zone for land mines. They also stopped at a local school that had been relocated to a basement, where children now study during hours-long air raid alerts.

Buffett’s foundation, which focuses on humanitarian needs like agriculture, infrastructure and mine clearance, has contributed about $800 million to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, including $175 million in humanitarian demining. Svyrydenko’s ministry is responsible for Ukraine’s humanitarian demining infrastructure.

“He understands very well that if a country that can feed 400 million people cannot clear its fields and loses at least $12 billion of GDP every year due to mined land, it’s a major challenge,” Svyrydenko said of Buffett.

According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy, the country’s [agricultural sector](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-africa-lifestyle-middle-east-1b41faaa7ac0984d0673023b68d39a70)
 has lost 20.5% of its farmland since the invasion — due to land mines, occupation and ongoing fighting.

Roughly 139,000 square kilometers (53,670 square miles) of Ukrainian land — about the size of the state of New York — are potentially mined."

Warren Buffett's son Howard has given $500M to Ukraine — he warns the US is making a historic mistake by pulling its support
============================================================================================================================

By [Rebecca Rommen](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/rebecca-rommen)

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Howard Buffett in Kyiv, Ukraine. Log in.

*   Business Insider interviewed Warren Buffett's son about his  support for Ukraine. 
*   Howard Buffett's foundation has given $520 million to Ukraine in humanitarian aid.
*   The philanthropist warns the US will make a historic blunder if it fails to support Ukraine's war effort.

Two years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the embattled nation needs its friends more than ever.

Russia celebrated [a landmark victory](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-troops-pull-out-key-eastern-town-avdiivka-russia-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 when it captured the eastern town of Avdiivka last week, and it is [running low on artillery ammunition.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-ammo-problems-hinder-ability-fire-at-russian-targets-2024-2?r=US&IR=T)
 Meanwhile, a $60 billion military aid package is snarled up in Congress due to opposition from some Republican Party lawmakers.

But Howard Buffett, the elder son of Warren, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO, has no intention of forsaking Ukraine or its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The wartime leader and American philanthropist have a profound mutual respect.

Buffett told Business Insider, "There are very few people in the world that could step up" and do what Zelenskyy's done. And it's going to be one of the biggest mistakes that the United States makes historically if we don't continue to support Ukraine.

"The most frustrating part is to watch the narrative in the US because you have congressmen and senators whose constituencies or districts are benefiting from this war," he said.

Putting his money where his mouth is, Buffett said another $300 million is budgeted for Ukraine this year, and for the last two years, the foundation exceeded the budgeted number.

The foundation is largely funded by his father, Warren Buffett's contributions. [Warren Buffett is the seventh richest person](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?embedded-checkout=true)
 in the world, boasting a net worth of $138 billion.

'You have to step up big'

Zelenskyy told Buffett: "You are among these world leaders — friends of Ukraine."

Buffett calls the war the "largest humanitarian crisis" that he's witnessed in his lifetime.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Buffett Foundation has emerged as a stalwart ally to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion, injecting $521,779,225 into humanitarian assistance for Ukraine as of January 2024.

The US and its 'Ukraine fatigue' problem
----------------------------------------

"The guy's got to be worn out," Buffett said of Zelenskyy. So to me, he's somebody who has stepped up and done a job that I think very few people could do," said Buffett.

"I don't think anybody could have done a better job," he said, observing that "it's an incredible force that he's up against."

While Buffett worries about Zelenskyy's exhausting schedule and sleepless nights, he is also concerned about "Ukraine fatigue" affecting its most important ally, the United States.

He warned against it last year and continues stressing the importance of supporting the war effort.

**Zelenskyy's visit to the White House ends abruptly after Oval Office spat** **Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, which Trump has said is a step toward a broader peace deal he is trying to broker. But no deal was signed and the visit was cut short.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

There was an extraordinary scene in the Oval Office today - President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy openly fighting about how to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country's in big trouble.

PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: Wait a minute. President...

CHANG: Zelenskyy was at the White House to finalize a deal on minerals, a deal that Trump has said is a step towards the broader peace deal that he's trying to broker. And later this afternoon, Trump told reporters that he thinks Zelenskyy wants to keep fighting, that he does not want to make peace and that he feels like Zelenskky overplayed his hand today.

CHANG: Well what did President Zelenskyy have to say after all of this happened?

KHALID: Well after he left the White House, he went on to do an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. The visit was cut short, lunch called off, a joint press conference canceled, and Zelenskyy left the White House. And, Ailsa, it is not clear when and if it will actually be signed.

The White House says Zelenskyy was told to leave. A White House official told me that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's national security adviser conveyed that message to the Ukrainian delegation. No, no.

ZELENSKYY: Can I answer?

TRUMP: You've done a lot of talking. You're not winning this.

ZELENSKYY: I...

TRUMP: You have a damn good chance of...

ZELENSKYY: We are staying...

TRUMP: ...Coming out OK because of us.

ZELENSKYY: Mr."

Fractures emerge quickly in meeting
-----------------------------------

From the moment Zelenskyy arrived at the White House, there were indications the meeting would be prickly.

Trump greeted Zelenskyy at the White House driveway with a handshake and a quip about his outfit, which was a black version of his usual military uniform — a symbol of his status as a wartime president.

“He’s all dressed up today,” Trump said aloud, pointing at Zelenskyy’s outfit.

As the two leaders settled into the Oval Office for their first press appearance of the day, Trump launched into his usual talking points, touting the deal to access Ukraine’s rare earth minerals.

“ We’re gonna sign the agreement at the conference in the East Room in a little, while right after lunch,” Trump said.

“ We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to getting in and digging, digging, digging and working and getting some of the rare earth.”

But very quickly, it became clear the two leaders were not on the same page about the deal.

Zelenskyy emphasised that any agreement needed to include real security assurances for Ukraine, something the US under Trump has so far avoided.

“I hope that this document, first document will be first step to real security guarantees for Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president said. ![JD Vance, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy sit in the Oval Office](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059667476448-1740778890.jpg?resize=730%2C410&quality=80)

A high-profile meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his United States counterpart Donald Trump has devolved into a shouting match, as the two leaders clashed over the future of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Friday, Zelenskyy [arrived at the White House](/news/liveblog/2025/2/28/donald-trump-live-news-zelenskyy-in-dc-for-talks-on-rare-minerals-deal)
 to discuss a proposed deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, while pushing for US security assurances.

But as the two leaders sat down for a news conference in the Oval Office, the atmosphere quickly curdled, with Trump shouting at Zelenskyy, telling him to be “thankful” for US support.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Trump told Zelenskyy.

Shortly after the close of the meeting, Trump released a statement on social media, seeming to withdraw the US from negotiations with Ukraine and eject Zelenskyy from the White House. “He had to go through that.”

Accusations of ‘disrespect’
---------------------------

The Trump team repeated well-worn accusations that the administration of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, was responsible for allowing the war in Ukraine to start in the first place.

As tensions started to skyrocket, US Vice President JD Vance took a swing against Biden, accusing him of  ”thumping \[his\] chest” to end the war. “Our people, our children, are really counting it.”

A clash over relations with Putin
---------------------------------

Trump also quickly touted his ongoing negotiations with Putin, saying that they had “very good discussions” together and would bring the war to a close.

The US president had previously said that it was “unlikely” that Ukraine would return to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia started to seize territories like Crimea and Donetsk. And soon after, Zelenskyy was spotted exiting the White House in a dark vehicle, as a line of representatives from the Ukrainian delegation walked out of the building.

The war of words soon shifted to the internet, where each leader offered remarks on what transpired in the Oval Office.

“Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390)
 on his platform, Truth Social. “ I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.”

Within minutes, the meeting was at an end.

An uncertain future
-------------------

No deal on rare earth minerals was signed that afternoon. No deal was ultimately signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved,” Trump wrote. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

For more than a decade, Ukraine has faced territorial incursions from Russia, culminating in a full-scale invasion that began in February 2022.

The international community has largely denounced Russia’s actions as illegal, and the US has been a pivotal partner in Ukraine’s defence, committing [$65.9bn](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/Timeline/)
 in military assistance since the start of the war three years ago.

But that support has come into doubt since Trump took office in January. Earlier this month, Trump spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and sent US envoys to negotiate a peace deal with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

Zelenskyy and other European leaders have denounced those proceedings as sidelining their interests.

Trump has since ratcheted up tensions, calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” for not holding wartime elections and accusing him of taking advantage of the US “gravy train”.

Zelenskyy was the third European leader to visit Trump this week, after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. And on Friday, Zelenskyy emphasised that Trump’s support would be “crucial” to maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

“I really count on your strong position to stop Putin,” Zelenskyy said."

19-second video of Zelensky goes viral. See what was edited out

03:03

Washington CNN  — 

A viral video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky takes his remarks out of context to wrongly make it sound like he demanded that Americans send their sons and daughters to fight in the war in Ukraine.

The out-of-context 19-second video has been viewed millions of times on Twitter. It features a clip of Zelensky speaking at a news conference last week as an interpreter translates his words into English as follows: “The US will have to send their sons and daughters, exactly the same way as we are sending, their sons and daughters to war. Mike Lee of Utah shared former Trump administration official William Wolfe’s tweet of the video in which Wolfe claimed that Zelensky wants “dead Americans on Ukrainian soil.” Lee himself [added](https://twitter.com/BasedMikeLee/status/1630787239427883008?s=20)
 in a tweet on Tuesday night: “Zelensky has no right to presume that our sons and daughters will fight his war. But it’s just inaccurate to depict Zelensky’s “have to send their sons and daughters” remark as a demand that Americans take part in combat on Ukrainian soil.

Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment, and Crowley could not be immediately reached for comment. Rather, he predicted that if Ukraine loses the war against Russia because it does not receive sufficient assistance, Russia will proceed to enter North Atlantic Treaty Organization_ [_member countries_](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/nato_countries.htm)
 _in the Baltics (a region made up of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) that the US will have to send troops to defend. Ukraine is not a NATO member._

Lee deleted his tweet after CNN informed his office on Wednesday about how the video was taken out of context.

Zelensky made the comments at a news conference on the anniversary of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources describe a contentious meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump at the White House on February 28, 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the meeting involved Donald Trump, JD Vance, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The meeting ended abruptly after an "Oval Office spat," as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312076/zelenskyys-visit-to-the-white-house-ends-abruptly-after-oval-office-spat)).

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy)) also covered the meeting, highlighting disagreements over a deal for Ukraine's rare earth minerals and security assurances. However, none of the sources mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. Fact-checkers from Yahoo News, CNN, and VOA News have debunked the claim that Zelenskyy said the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

The evidence also shows that Zelenskyy made similar remarks two years before the alleged White House meeting, but not in the context described in the claim. The sources covering the February 2025 meeting do not mention the statement.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa expresses fear and distaste at how Trump treats Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

After Friday's contentious meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the White House was sent a letter. His letter was signed by dozens of other former Polish political prisoners.

ANDRZEJ BOBINKSI: Nobody wants to say anything too vivid, too aggressive towards, you know, Donald Trump and the United States. And I think that, you know, by the end of Donald Trump's term, Poland will be in a very different place.

SCHMITZ: And Walesa's scathing letter, says Bobinski, is a sign of Poland turning away from its longtime friend. As NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz reports, the letter expressed to the Trump administration what the Polish government cannot.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The letter begins with your excellency Mr. and its historical antipathy towards Russia.

BOBINKSI: Donald Trump is way too lenient and way too friendly towards Vladimir Putin. And I don't think anybody has come out outright and said that we don't want to be friends with the United States anymore.

SCHMITZ: Certainly not Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, who made this statement after the Oval Office incident.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK: (Speaking Polish).

SCHMITZ: "I know a narrative is being created, especially after that very strange Friday at the White House," said Tusk, "that would divide Europe and the United States. It goes on to compare Trump and Vance's treatment of Zelenskyy to interrogations by political police under communist Poland, and it demands more respect for a leader whose soldiers are shedding blood to defend the free world. We do not understand, the letter says, how the leader of a country that is a symbol of the free world cannot see that. The author is Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, the first Democratically elected president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his leadership in opposing communist rule. "We cannot allow that to happen," he said."

WARSAW — Poland’s democracy hero Lech Walesa and dozens of other former political prisoners in Poland have written a letter to President Trump, telling him that his treatment of Ukraine’s president at the Oval Office last week filled them “with horror and distaste.”

Walesa, who served as president soon after Poland embraced democracy, and the others tell Trump that they found it offensive that he expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show respect and gratitude for the materiel assistance the United States has given Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

The White House has demanded that Zelensky show more openness to potential concessions in order to bring the fighting to an end, but Zelensky has been resistant, saying Monday that any deal with Russia is still “very, very far away,” while seeking greater security guarantees from Washington.

----------- So they’re in the process of setting it up and we’re going to see what happens.”

Trump’s reluctance to push Putin and Zelenskyy to a meeting comes as he has acknowledged in recent days that ending the war in Ukraine has been more difficult than he had anticipated, after [saying on the campaign trail](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/politics/fact-check-trump-ukraine-war)
 last year he could achieve it in 24 hours.

He has since sought a quick peace agreement after his deadline for Russia to end the war expired this month and said after his [meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin)
 at the White House on Monday that he had initiated steps for a bilateral meeting.

A senior administration official characterized the situation as Trump taking a “wait-and-see approach” to whether a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting could be scheduled. Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, later said the two leaders agreed that more senior negotiators would be appointed for direct talks between Russia and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
.

That statement signaled that a bilateral meeting could remain some way off, even as the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, expressed optimism it could happen within two weeks and Putin has rejected previous attempts by Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face since the start of the war.

At a news conference on Monday night after the White House meetings, Zelenskyy said that the European leaders’ meeting with Trump centered on security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace agreement to ensure Russia did not resume its invasion.

Trump offered to contribute to security guarantees, but has since [ruled out deploying US troops](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump)

Trump steps back from Russia and Ukraine peace talks for now, sources say
=========================================================================

US president told top advisers trilateral meeting would take place after leaders of the two countries have met first

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy)
, the Ukrainian president, the officials said.

Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort.

In a phone interview with talk show host Mark Levin on WABC on Tuesday, Trump also said he thought it would be better for Putin and Zelenskyy to meet without him in the first instance. But there have been few tangible signs in recent days of progress and the White House does not have a shortlist of locations where the meeting could take place.

In a statement, the White House said: “Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukranian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war… It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.”

After the meetings at the White House, Trump spoke to Putin on a call that lasted around 40 minutes. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has also suggested that Russia should be one of the security guarantors for Ukraine – a proposal the White House has privately scoffed at, one official said.

“The Ukrainian side proposed, and our delegation at that time agreed, to work out security guarantees that would involve all permanent members of the UN security council – that is, Russia, the People’s Republic of China, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom,” Lavrov said.

After the White House meetings, Zelenskyy also outlined a plan to purchase $90bn in American weapons through Europe to win security guarantees, and for the US to buy drones from Ukraine. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, 18 August 2025, in Washington. Any US assistance is expected to come in the form of intelligence sharing or possibly US air support.

Previously, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, had said on CNN’s “state of the union” after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska that Putin agreed the US could offer Ukraine a security guarantee that resembled Nato’s Article 5 collective self-defense mandate.

“We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,” Witkoff said.

But Putin’s acceptance of Nato-like security guarantees may not be as straightforward."

Ukraine's president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
, Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
, and Head of the Presidential Office, [Andriy Yermak](/wiki/Andriy_Yermak "Andriy Yermak")

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 proposed in November 2022 a 10-point peace plan,[\[26\]](#cite_note-kp10point-26)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-ajz1-27)
[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
 consisting of:

*   A ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine
*   Restoration of Ukraine's borders prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea
*   Release of prisoners and return of [Ukrainian children deported to Russia](/wiki/Child_abductions_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War")
    
*   Protection and restoration of [Ukraine's energy infrastructure](/wiki/Russian_strikes_against_Ukrainian_infrastructure_(2022%E2%80%93present) "Russian strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure (2022–present)")
    
*   Protection of [food distribution](/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_food_crises#Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022–2023 food crises")
    
*   Nuclear safety, including transfer of [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant](/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant_crisis "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant crisis")
     to the [IAEA](/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency "International Atomic Energy Agency")
    
*   Environmental safety, including [demining](/wiki/Demining "Demining")
     and remediation of ecological damage caused by the [destruction of the Kakhovka Dam](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Kakhovka_Dam "Destruction of the Kakhovka Dam")
    
*   Prosecution of [Russian war crimes](/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine")
    
*   Security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent future aggression
*   A multilateral peace conference and peace treaty

Two months before the invasion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister [Dmytro Kuleba](/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba "Dmytro Kuleba")
 dismissed the idea that declaring [neutrality](/wiki/Neutral_country "Neutral country")
 would prevent Russian aggression. The agreement was however blocked by Putin, who "expanded his objectives to include annexing swathes of Ukrainian territory".[\[21\]](#cite_note-Reuters14092022-21)
 A Kremlin spokesman denied the story.[\[47\]](#cite_note-moscowtimes-deal-47)

### Belarus and Antalya peace talks

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy "Volodymyr Zelenskyy")
 and Belarusian president [Alexander Lukashenko](/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko "Alexander Lukashenko")
 agreed on 27 February that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with Russian officials in Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, without preconditions.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)
 It was reported that Lukashenko assured Zelenskyy that all planes, helicopters, and missiles on Belarusian territory would remain on the ground during the negotiations.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

Talks began on 28 February at one of Lukashenko's countryside residences near Liaskavičy, about 30 miles from the [Belarus-Ukraine border](/wiki/Belarus-Ukraine_border "Belarus-Ukraine border")
.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Ukrainian delegation was led by [Davyd Arakhamia](/wiki/Davyd_Arakhamia "Davyd Arakhamia")
 and included defense minister [Oleksii Reznikov](/wiki/Oleksii_Reznikov "Oleksii Reznikov")
, presidential adviser [Mykhailo Podolyak](/wiki/Mykhailo_Podolyak "Mykhailo Podolyak")
, and others. The Ukrainians wanted a peacetime army of 250,000; the Russians demanded a maximum of 85,000, which is much smaller than the standing army Ukraine had before the invasion.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)
 The Russians also demanded severe limits on the amount and kinds of weaponry Ukraine could have, without any limits on Russia's military.[\[42\]](#cite_note-ForeignAffairs_CharapRadchenko2024-42)

A third disagreement was the Russians' new demands for Ukraine to revoke several of its domestic laws, dealing with [contentious aspects of Soviet-era history](/wiki/Decolonization_in_Ukraine "Decolonization in Ukraine")
, such as the role of Ukrainian nationalists in World War II. Secretary of State [Antony Blinken](/wiki/Antony_Blinken "Antony Blinken")
 insisted that Ukraine continue fighting in response to Milley's statement.[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)
 Ukraine presented the detailed [10-point peace proposal](/wiki/Ukraine%27s_Peace_Formula "Ukraine's Peace Formula")
 later in November at a [G20](/wiki/G20 "G20")
 meeting.[\[129\]](#cite_note-AJE_Zelenskyy_10pt_plan-129)

Ad Feedback But they understand that the kind of deal sought by Russia can’t happen unless the most basic principle underpinning the global order – that a country cannot get what it wants by force – is thrown under the bus.

And Kyiv’s European allies are not willing to risk that, not least because they could well become the next target of Russia’s aggression.

Speaking to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and several European leaders in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump adopted some of Moscow’s talking points, questioning whether a ceasefire was “necessary” if a broader peace deal could be achieved.

But international law experts and analysts say that any deal that would force Ukraine to give up its land to stop the killing of its people by Russia would be completely illegal under the UN Charter, a key international agreement which most countries signed up to after the horrors of the Second World War.

While often thought of as essentially the same thing, there is a big difference between a peace deal and a ceasefire in the eyes of international law.

During a ceasefire, warring parties agree to stop fighting with each side keeping hold of the territory under its military control. So what that also (means) is that any treaty that you procure by use of force is effectively illegal and is inherently void,” said Jeremy Pizzi, an international lawyer and a legal adviser of Global Rights Compliance, a human rights foundation.

Little detail has been shared about the kind of peace deal Putin discussed with Trump last week, but it is clear that the Russian leader has not abandoned some of his maximalist demands, including that Ukraine give up the entire eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, known as the Donbas, and is banned from joining NATO in the future.

This would make the deal doubly illegal under international law: illegal because of the way it would be reached – by force – and illegal because of its content.

But even if he wanted to – which he does not – Zelensky cannot agree to give up territory.

Under the Ukrainian constitution, any change to the country’s borders must be approved by a referendum – a rule that is in place partly because of Russia’s tendency to install puppet governments in foreign countries.

And, crucially, even if Kyiv were to recognize that the reality on the ground gives Russia the de-facto control of some of its land, it would certainly not agree to make this a permanent recognition. That has not stopped some [European leaders](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-ukraine-zelensky-russia-putin-08-18-25)
 from pushing for a temporary truce first, even though the US president has seemingly decided one is not necessary.

It’s not that [Kyiv](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine)
 and its allies don’t want peace. But the understanding is that the pause is temporary – usually to provide a window to negotiate, deliver humanitarian help or evacuate civilians.

Kyiv and its European allies suggested that a ceasefire might be a precursor for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelensky, and Putin.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who attended the summit on Monday, said that he “can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire.”

A ceasefire can be short – like the 1914 Christmas Truce that lasted a few days – or it could stretch to decades. The prohibition of using armed force to conquer territory is absolute under international law,” Pizzi said.

No ‘sensible reason to trust Russia’
------------------------------------

There are also practical and strategic reasons why Ukraine cannot agree to Moscow’s demands.

The Russian military currently controls almost all of Luhansk and more than 70% of Donetsk, which means that Putin is asking Kyiv to give up even more than it has lost so far.

But the parts of the Donbas region that are still under Kyiv’s control include infrastructure that is crucial for Ukraine’s defense. If they were to be taken by Russia, the road to the western parts of the country would be wide open.

There is also little incentive for Kyiv to trust Moscow, Pizzi said.

“Russia has engaged in armed attacks against Ukraine for over 10 years now, consistently, repeatedly during that time. Russia has feigned negotiations, feigned good faith, while continuing to use violence and keeping up the same illegal maximalist goals in the background and Ukrainian authorities are painfully aware of this,” he said.

“There is no logical, sensible reason to trust Russia in the absence of a precursor, a good faith decision or engagement that they make on their part to hold off from killing more Ukrainians,” he added.

Causes
------

According to political scientist [Paul D'Anieri](/wiki/Paul_D%27Anieri "Paul D'Anieri")
, Russia had the following four causes to start its war with Ukraine in 2014, as well as for the [2022 war](/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine")
:

*   Russia’s desire to regain control of Ukraine and turn it into a [puppet regime](/wiki/Puppet_regime "Puppet regime")
    .
*   Russia's conception of itself as a great power entitled to a [sphere of influence](/wiki/Sphere_of_influence "Sphere of influence")
     over the former Soviet Republics.
*   The security dilemma in Europe, with Russia perceiving the [expansion of NATO](/wiki/Expansion_of_NATO "Expansion of NATO")
     as a threat, and other Eastern states desiring guarantees against Russian expansionism.
*   Democratic Ukraine being a threat to [authoritarian regime](/wiki/Putinism "Putinism")
     in Russia.[\[63\]](#cite_note-:8-66)

Content: "Over the past year, Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control, mostly in the east of Ukraine, and have continued their recent barrage of air strikes on Kyiv and other cities.**

Despite US President Donald Trump's most recent push for an end to the war - hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Alaska and subsequently meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and other European leaders - there has been no diplomatic breakthrough.

Here is a recap of the situation on the ground in Ukraine.

Russia grinds forward in the east
---------------------------------

In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions - also known as the Donbas - surrounding and overwhelming villages and towns.

It has been trying to gain full control of the area along with two more regions to the west - Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Source: ISW <image:5000>

Trump has said any peace deal would involve "some swapping of territories" and it is believed one of Putin's demands is that Kyiv surrenders the parts of the Donbas area it still controls.

Zelensky has consistently said Ukraine would not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace, saying such a concession could be used as a springboard for future attacks by Russia.

Summer offensive targets key towns
----------------------------------

A Russian summer offensive had been progressing slowly, until troops made a sudden thrust near the eastern town of Dobropillya, advancing 10km (six miles) in a short period of time.

This rapid advance took place just north of the town of Pokrovsk, described as the hottest spot on the front line at this point of the war.

Ukrainian forces have faced superior Russian manpower on the front lines throughout the war, but reported shortages in the east have left this key Russian target increasingly vulnerable.

Experts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say Russian troops are attacking Pokrovsk itself.

Analysts are concerned that thousands of Ukrainians defending the city could be at risk of encirclement from Russian troops. It hasn't been possible to verify either country's claims.

More recently Moscow blamed Ukrainian drones for a massive oil depot fire near Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi - the venue of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games.

Meanwhile, Russia has continued to bomb Ukrainian cities, [launching 574 drones and 40 missiles on the night of 20 August](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-21-2025)
 - which the ISW described as the third-largest strike of the war so far.

Ceasefire talks
---------------

Since Trump took office at the start of 2025, the US has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiations.

There have been no major breakthrough in talks, leading Trump to threaten to impose further severe tariffs on Russia, targeting its oil and other exports, if it failed to agree a ceasefire.

That deadline passed on the same day it was announced that Trump and Putin would meet at a summit in Alaska.

The summit and subsequent meetings with European leaders and Zelensky ended without a peace deal but Trump did not rule out the US helping to guarantee Ukraine's security if a deal could be reached.

Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia

Zelensky has downplayed the latest advance, arguing that Moscow's objective is to create propaganda that "Russia is moving forward, advancing, while Ukraine is losing" before Putin meets Trump.

Fighting is also continuing around the nearby town of Chasiv Yar, although Ukraine has denied Russian claims that it has fallen.

*   [Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj0q964851po)
    

Little remains of Chasiv Yar after 16 months of artillery, ground and drone attacks, but occupying the high ground it sits on would allow Russia to target big cities in the area of the Donetsk region still under Ukrainian control, including Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk and Slovyansk.

Russian incursion north of Kharkiv
----------------------------------

Further north, Russia has been pushing towards Kupyansk in east of the Kharkiv region, as part of its efforts to capture the whole of Luhansk and encircle northern Donetsk.

In addition to the eastern front, in May 2024 Russia began what the ISW describes as its "subordinate main effort", when it crossed the border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv.

Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.

Recent ISW analysis of the area shows Russia has advanced near Vovchansk and Lyptsi as it tries to create a buffer zone inside Ukraine's northern borders and get within artillery range of Kharkiv.

! Security guarantees are generally seen as paramount to any sort of deal with Russia.

Trump also suggested there might be a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelensky - something Zelensky has been seeking for some time - however, the Kremlin has subsequently played that down.

Ukraine minerals deal
---------------------

At the end of April the US and Ukraine signed a long-discussed deal to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves.

The [deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg456mzn8o)
 - still the country's biggest supplier of military assistance - to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction, as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.

It will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war.

Three years of fighting
-----------------------

Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.

Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.

Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.

! <image:4997>!Series of four maps showing changes in Russian military control in Ukraine from February 2022 to August 2025.\
Feb 2022: No Russian military control.\
Mar 2022: Rapid Russian advance with areas in red (control) and red stripes (limited control).\
Nov 2022: Ukraine regains territory; Russian-controlled areas reduced.\
Aug 2025: Russia edges forward; controlled areas increase again.\
The maps highlight cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Kursk, and Pokrovsk. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.

Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months - military experts estimate between 165,000 and 235,000 Russian service personnel have been killed since the invasion.

Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be an under-estimate.

Newsweek AI is in beta. He also emphasized Russia's "key condition" for peace of an end to all foreign military and intelligence support for Ukraine.

However, Putin said Russia would immediately stop strikes on energy infrastructure, which Ukraine had also agreed to. Zelensky pointed to Russian strikes following the talks and said Putin's words are "different from reality."

Further talks are due in the coming days in Saudi Arabia between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine, although none directly are currently planned between the two warring parties. "We would not agree to that," he said in Finland.

 said, per RIA: "Putin and Trump understand and trust each other well...Stopping military assistance to Kyiv will be high on the agenda of negotiations between Moscow and Washington, but this topic will not be publicly discussed."

What's Next
-----------

A prisoner exchange is due to take place between Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday.

Zelensky and Trump will speak today, and then contacts between the three parties will continue in the coming days to firm up details on partial, temporary ceasefires relating to energy infrastructure and the Black Sea.

If those can be agreed, the diplomatic work will shift to a full 30-day ceasefire and then an eventual peace deal.

Why It Matters
--------------

Trump is seeking a swift peace in Ukraine. He has criticized the death and destruction, and the cost to American taxpayers of supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion, which began in February 2022.

Talks are ongoing and appear to be making progress, but there are substantial areas of disagreement, such as on the division of territory and the future of Ukrainian security, that stand in the way of a full peace deal.

What People Are Saying

Zelensky reiterated that Kyiv's "red line" in future talks is Ukraine accepting that its "temporarily occupied territories" are Russian."

**Rumor – Vladimir Putin allegedly demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci for crimes related to the pandemic as a condition to end the conflict in Ukraine.**

Analysis

Denialist and conspiratorial content involving public figures such as Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci continues to circulate on conspiracy websites.

These publications often reinforce theories of the so-called “new world order,” deny the severity of the Covid-19 pandemic, and portray authoritarian leaders as “saviors” in a battle against global elites. Another example is the false claim that [he was arrested for child trafficking](https://www.boatos.org/mundo/bill-gates-preso-exercito-americano-trafico-de-criancas-outros-crimes.html)
, which was also completely fabricated.

Conclusion

It is false that Vladimir Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci as a condition to end the war with Ukraine. Given this, let’s answer the following questions: 1) Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine? 3) Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal actions in Russia?

Did Putin request the extradition of Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci to end the war in Ukraine?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. A post claims that Putin demanded the extradition of Bill Gates and Fauci to be tried in Russia for bioterrorism and crimes against humanity.

According to the story, this would be the condition imposed by the Russian president to end the war in Ukraine. There is no official record — whether from the Russian government, credible media, or diplomatic sources — that Vladimir Putin ever made any extradition request involving Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci. These demands have been detailed in reports by [Veja](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/as-condicoes-que-putin-pode-impor-ao-acordo-de-cessar-fogo-com-ucrania/)
, [G1](https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2025/03/13/vladimir-putin-condiciona-cessar-fogo-com-a-ucrania-a-uma-serie-de-exigencias-como-manter-definitivamente-territorios-que-invadiu.ghtml)
 and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/14/what-are-putins-conditions-for-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine)
.

Are Gates and Fauci facing any legal action in Russia?
------------------------------------------------------

No. Read:

_Putin demands extradition of Gates and Fauci to face Russian justice for Bioterrorism! It is a work of fiction with no basis in concrete facts or verifiable statements.

What are Putin’s actual conditions to end the war in Ukraine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Putin’s real conditions for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine have been disclosed multiple times. In this scenario, Vladimir Putin is often depicted as the central figure of an alleged resistance.

Recently, one of these stories has resurfaced."

The German government has confirmed the release of 15 people “unjustly imprisoned in [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
,” Reuters reported.

**Who is Alsu Kurmasheva?**

Kurmasheva, one of the prisoner freed as part of the exchange, is a Russian-American journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

A Russian court sentenced the 47-year old in July to six-and-a-half years in prison after a rushed, secret trial.

Kurmasheva, who has two children, was arrested last year during a family visit to the city of Kazan for failing to register as a “foreign agent” and for spreading “false information” about the country’s armed forces.

Stephen Capus, the RFE/RL president and CEO, had denounced her trial and conviction as “a mockery of justice”.

!Alsu Kurmasheva listens to her lawyer during a court hearing in Kazan, Russia on Friday, May 31. “This operation has been recorded in history as the most extensive prisoner exchange between the United States, Russia, and Germany in recent years.”

From what we can see, the exchange is still in process, and hasn’t officially ended until all of the planes have left the tarmac in Ankara.

As part of the exchange, Germany has released a Russian assassin, **[Vadim Krasikov](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/26/vadim-krasikov-who-russian-hitman-navalny-prisoner-swap-claim#:~:text=Explainer-,Vadim%20Krasikov%3A%20who%20is%20Russian%20hitman,to%20Navalny%20prisoner%20swap%20claim%3F&text=Allies%20of%20the%20late%20Russian,convicted%20hitman%20jailed%20in%20Germany.)
**, according to a Turkish presidency statement.

A high-ranking colonel in the Russian secret service FSB, the 58-year old was serving a life sentence in a German jail for [the 2019 murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/28/russia-denies-ordering-assassination-of-zelimkhan-khangoshvili-chechen-exile-in-berlin)
 of **Zelimkhan Khangoshvili**, a Georgian-born Chechen dissident, in Berlin’s central Tiergarten park.

Vladimir Putin had made it clear that securing Krasikov’s return to [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 was his No 1 target.

The Russian leader [alluded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/putin-says-release-of-us-journalist-evan-gershkovich-may-be-possible)
 to him in February, saying the release of the US journalist **Evan Gershkovich** could be secured in a prison swap involving a man, whom he described as a “patriot” serving a life sentence in a “US allied country” after being convicted of “liquidating a bandit”.

**Joe Biden has released a statement about the prisoner exchange.**

He called the deal a “feat of diplomacy” and vowing that he “will not stop working until every American wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world is reunited with their family.”

> Today, three American citizens and one American green-card holder who were unjustly imprisoned in Russia are finally coming home: Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, Alsu Kurmasheva, and Vladimir Kara-Murza.
> 
> The deal that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. Thank you to all those who worked to free these fighters for freedom, human rights, and democracy.

In short:
---------

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris welcomed the three Americans released in the prison swap as their plane touched down in Maryland. 

Mr Biden thanked the collective effort of the countries involved in the major international swap. 

What's next?
------------

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

US President Joe Biden has welcomed home the three Americans who were sentenced to years in Russian penal colonies after secret "sham" trials and now free under a major East-West prisoner swap. 

Mr Biden and Kamala Harris met the plane carrying detainees that landed in the United States on Thursday, local time, in Maryland. 

The president stressed the importance of diplomacy and praised the collective effort of Washington's allies in the multinational deal.

"Alliances make a difference," he said. 

"They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.

"I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia," Mr Biden said. 

Vice-President Harris said it was "an extraordinary day".

"You can see it in the families, in their eyes and in their cries."

They were both serving sentences on spying charges that the US says were false.

Also released was Alsu Kurmasheva, a reporter for a US-funded radio network in Europe, who was last month jailed for six and a half years for "spreading false information" about the Russian military.

British-Russian dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize winner who had written for the Washington Post, was also freed. He said Buenos Nochas."

Earlier on Thursday, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, commenting on the prisoner exchange, said that traitors to his country should rot and die in prison, but that it was more useful for Moscow to get its own people home.

"And let the traitors now feverishly adopt new names and actively disguise themselves under witness protection programmes," Mr Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel.

Six countries release at least one prisoner 
--------------------------------------------

Russia also received three men charged by federal authorities in the US, including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. 

Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being in a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges.

"Today is a powerful example of why it's vital to have friends in this world," Mr Biden said earlier.

All told, six countries released at least one prisoner.

The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the US to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offences. 

The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivise future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the US and its allies.

Tucker, the Journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing in a letter: "We know the US government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice."

Though she called for a change to the dynamic, "for now," she wrote, "we are celebrating the return of Evan."

The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The swap was coordinated by Türkiye, its intelligence agency said, and the American and German prisoners were taken to its capital, Ankara, before they were able to return home.

Eight Russians — who were being held in the US, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia — were released too. I will see you again, we will talk about your future." 

On Friday, the Kremlin said Vadim Krasikov was an employee of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) and had served in Alpha Group, the FSB's special forces unit.

Among those also released to Moscow was a Russian family, the Dultsevs and their two children, whom a court in Slovenia convicted of pretending to be Argentinians in order to spy on the EU and NATO member state.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the couple were "illegals" — deep-cover agents trained to impersonate foreigners, who spend years living abroad in their cover identities.

"The children of the 'illegal' intelligence agents who flew in yesterday only learnt that they were Russian after the plane took off (for Moscow) from Ankara," Mr Peskov told reporters.

"Before that, they didn't know that they were Russian and that they had anything to do with our country. And you probably saw that when the children came down the plane's steps that they don't speak Russian and that Putin greeted them in Spanish."

### Evidence from `web_search`
On August 1, 2024, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed three Americans freed by Russia at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, as reported by CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-prisoner-swap-biden-harris-welcome-paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-prisoner-swap-biden-harris-welcome-paul-whelan-evan-gershkovich/)) <image:7512>, <image:7513>. ABC News also reported on August 2, 2024, that Biden welcomed home the three Americans released in a prisoner swap with Russia ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-02/biden-meets-with-freed-americans-in-major-russia-prisoner-swap/104174404](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-02/biden-meets-with-freed-americans-in-major-russia-prisoner-swap/104174404)) <image:7525>, <image:7526>, <image:7527>.

The U.S. Air Force also provided photos of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris welcoming the three Americans at Joint Base Andrews on August 1, 2024 ([https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3860680/americans-released-from-russian-custody-arrive-at-joint-base-andrews/](https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3860680/americans-released-from-russian-custody-arrive-at-joint-base-andrews/)) <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that on August 1, 2024, President Biden welcomed the freed Americans upon their arrival. The Times of India reported that Biden entered an empty plane after the arrival of the freed Americans on August 3, 2024, but the White House clarified that he did so to thank the flight crew.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate as multiple sources confirm that President Biden boarded a plane after the freed Americans arrived. `true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

Content: "You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. ![Donald Trump](/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-20T032938Z_1960498084_RC22YCAIM23O_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1740037743.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

“I think I have the power to end this war, and I think it’s going very well,” [Trump said](/news/2025/2/19/trump-says-he-will-probably-meet-putin-this-month-hits-out-at-ukraine)
, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address. In 1994, Ukraine agreed with the US, the United Kingdom and Russia to exchange its nuclear arsenal, the world’s third-largest, for security guarantees.

But the rush of post-Soviet history grated on Putin, analysts say.

Putin has served as Russia’s top leader since 1999, with a four-year period in which he was nominally number two but was widely considered the country’s ultimate centre of power.

He has long sought to establish the theoretical foundations for escalating the war in Ukraine, a country with about one-third the population of Russia and, before the war, about one-ninth the gross domestic product.

As early as 2008, Putin told then-President George W Bush that “Ukraine is not a country”."

### Invasion plans

The [Royal United Services Institute](/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute "Royal United Services Institute")
 reported that Russia's plan involved defeating Ukraine within ten days and capturing or killing its government, followed by ["mopping up" operations](/wiki/Zachistka "Zachistka")
; establishing [filtration camps for Ukrainians](/wiki/Russian_filtration_camps_for_Ukrainians "Russian filtration camps for Ukrainians")
; setting up occupation regimes; executing people involved in the Revolution of Dignity; and lastly annexation.[\[107\]](#cite_note-RUSI_invasion_plan-110)
[\[108\]](#cite_note-KyivPost_invasion_plan-111)
[\[109\]](#cite_note-SkyNews_invasion_plan-112)

 or _[siloviki](/wiki/Silovik "Silovik")

 [Sergei Shoigu](/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu "Sergei Shoigu")

After the start of the invasion, Ukrainian and Western analysts tentatively assessed that Putin seemed to have assumed that the Russian Armed Forces would be capable of capturing the Ukrainian capital city of [Kyiv](/wiki/Kyiv "Kyiv")
 within days. Briefings from Western officials had also become more pessimistic about Ukraine's military situation.[\[344\]](#cite_note-telegraph-20241030-347)

Russia’s UK ambassador falsely claims Zelenskyy started Russia-Ukraine war

#### Andrei Kelin

Russian Ambassador to the UK

"Zelenskyy said he would quickly make peace with Russia, but instead, he started a war."

[Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gve08si3Oaw&t=989s "Source: YouTube, February 20, 2025")

False

On Feb. By 2019, when Zelenskyy won the presidency, the war had been ongoing for five years.

**Key events:**

*   **2014:** Russia annexed Crimea, and covert Russian forces seized government buildings in Donbas, escalating tensions.

*   **2015:** Putin signed the Minsk agreements, which were designed to solidify Russian control over eastern Ukraine.

*   **2019:** Zelenskyy was elected president, vowing to end the war but refusing to concede to Russia's demands.

*   **2022:** Putin launched a full-scale invasion on Feb. <image:2119>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a press conference after the "Support Ukraine" summit, marking the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, in Kyiv, Ukraine, Feb. 24, following months of disinformation campaign and military buildup, dismissing global warnings.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2023 that Russia controlled parts of eastern Ukraine as early as May 2014.

**Conclusion:** Russia, not Ukraine, initiated the conflict, which escalated significantly in 2022 with Putin’s full-scale invasion.

From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025): 
Content: "Russia has leveled some Ukrainian cities as it has attacked and occupied them, such as Mariupol.\[4\] Cities throughout the 80 percent of Ukraine that Russian forces have not occupied have remained largely intact during Russia's invasion, apart from deliberate Russian strikes against critical and civilian infrastructure.\[5\]

**Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections in wartime (unlike the US Constitution, which requires it).**

Ukraine's Constitution prevents the Ukrainian government from holding elections or amending the constitution in times of martial law.\[6\]

Russia triggered Ukraine's martial law provisions when it launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government cannot constitutionally suspend martial law while Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition politicians, including those who have historically run against Zelensky, have stated that holding elections under martial law would be both illegal and immoral.\[7\]

**Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses.**

Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses by any reliable estimate, either in terms of civilian or military casualties.

Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion, and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action.\[8\]

US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000, but no reputable source places casualty estimates near or in the millions.\[9\]

The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.\[10\]

**Europe provides about as much direct aid to Ukraine as the United States.**

Europe (including European Union \[EU\] members and EU institutions plus Norway and the UK) has overtaken the United States in terms of cumulative direct (military and non-military) aid allocations to Ukraine (not counting the costs of US forces forward-deployed in Eastern Europe).\[11\]

*   Europe has provided Ukraine with a total of $166 billion in cumulative aid and pledged an additional $34.7 billion to be allocated through 2030.\[12\]
*   Europe has provided and pledged approximately $204.1 billion in all — over $174 billion from the EU, $13.9 billion from Norway, and $16.2 billion from the UK — compared to America's $183 billion.\[13\]
*   These figures do not include the EU and G7 commitments to provide loans to Ukraine financed by income generated from frozen Russian assets.

**European loans to Ukraine are backed by income from frozen Russian assets, not Ukraine.**

The EU is contributing $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that are backed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not Ukraine.\[14\]

*   The EU holds approximately $220.5 billion in Russian frozen assets.\[15\]
*   The EU has already made available $1.6 billion for Ukraine from immobilized Russian assets and disbursed $3.2 billion in loans in January 2025.

**Ukraine did not misuse or lose half of the aid the United States has provided.**

The majority of the funds the United States has allocated for Ukraine stays in the United States to fund domestic defense industrial base and replenish US stockpiles.\[16\]

US government agencies closely oversee the remaining US aid, which is directly issued to Ukraine. <image:3606>**](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UKR%20support%20fact%20sheet%2C%20February%2021%2C%202025%20PDF%201.pdf)

**Zelensky does not imminently risk losing all of Ukraine.**

Russian forces currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukraine, leaving the remaining 80 percent of the country under Ukraine's sovereign control.

At the current rate of advance, it would take Russian forces over 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine, assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely.

Russia's rate of advance on the frontline has slowed significantly over the past three months.\[1\]

Russian forces are making small territorial gains at the cost of massive personnel losses.\[2\]

Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 27.94 square kilometers per day in November 2024, 18.1 square kilometers per day in December 2024, and 16.1 square kilometers per day in January 2025.\[3\]

**Most Ukrainian cities have not been destroyed.**

Many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa, have avoided destruction and continue to function. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Office of the Inspector General reported on January 11, 2024, that it had found no evidence of misappropriated aid.\[17\]

**Ukraine repeatedly invited Putin to negotiate in early 2022.**

Zelensky proposed to meet with Putin on February 19, 2022 — just five days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\[18\] Putin ignored this request and invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\[19\]

Zelensky called for direct talks with Putin "in any format" in March 2022 and offered to compromise on Ukraine's accession into NATO.\[20\] The Russians demanded the full surrender and demilitarization of Ukraine.\[21\]

Zelensky also expressed openness to discussing the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on the condition that the Ukrainian people would ratify any deal through a referendum.\[22\] Putin rejected that offer as well.

From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: "More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.

Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.

Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

> Increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.

Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. The first examines Russian objectives and the Russian way of war in Ukraine. 
 

**The Russian Way of War**
--------------------------

Vladimir Putin’s primary objective is likely to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence, either directly by militarily conquering and annexing Ukraine or indirectly by installing a Russian ally in Kyiv."

Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Of course, this list is not exhaustive, as not every death is publicly reported.

To build a more complete picture of the war’s true toll, we have developed an estimate based on excess male mortality, using data from the national Probate Registry. The data from the very end of the year sits on the edge of where our model’s accuracy begins to decrease.

However, this surge is clear to see in a reliable indicator: the ratio of probate cases opened for men compared to those for women, as female mortality has not been affected by the war.

! They are, however, visible in the mortality estimate.

By the start of August, Russian courts had received **around 50,000 such** **military-related claims**."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting estimates regarding Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war as of February 2025. While some sources suggest figures around the claimed 1.5 million, others provide significantly lower numbers. The term "lost" is also ambiguous, as it could refer to killed, wounded, or missing. Due to the lack of a definitive figure for February 2025 and the conflicting information, the claim cannot be fully verified. `not enough information`

Mediazona ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), in an article updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also notes a peak in male mortality in November 2024, with approximately 3,000 deaths per week.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties to control four regions of Ukraine ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). However, the Russia Matters report card from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured as of January 2025.

Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 were killed by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The Center for Strategic and International Studies indicates that Russian fatalities are extraordinarily high, exceeding those of previous conflicts ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)).

The claim's veracity depends on whether "lost" refers to casualties (killed, wounded, missing) or only killed. The evidence provides different estimates, and the exact number of losses as of February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

### Evidence from `web_search`
As of August 21, 2025, the Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)) states that a British Army official estimated that Russia would suffer 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions of Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine War Report Card from Russia Matters, dated February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured as of January 2025, with 48,000 missing (<image:k>).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). The fact sheet mentions that Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. The fact sheet is available for download (<image:3605>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025.

Mediazona's estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)) is significantly lower. The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.

The claim's accuracy depends on the definition of "lost" (killed, wounded, missing) and the specific timeframe. The available data does not provide a definitive answer.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.
