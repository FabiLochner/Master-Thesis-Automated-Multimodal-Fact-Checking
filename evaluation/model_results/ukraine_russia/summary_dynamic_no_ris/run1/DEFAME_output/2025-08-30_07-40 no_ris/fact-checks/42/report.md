## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An AP News article from an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine, but discusses Zelenskyy's concerns about excluding Ukraine from talks between the U.S. and Russia, and his views on NATO membership. The U.S. News & World Report also published an article on February 1, 2025, discussing the interview, mentioning that Zelenskyy stated that his team has been in contact with the Trump administration <image:k>.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) released an audit of the DoD’s execution of funds to assist Ukraine, which revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. The report is from 2025. [Source](https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/3940692/press-release-audit-of-the-dods-execution-of-funds-to-assist-ukraine-report-no/)

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet dated February 8, 2024, addressing claims about US aid to Ukraine. The fact sheet states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that Congress appropriates specific amounts for specific purposes, with both Ukrainian and US officials monitoring the aid. The fact sheet also mentions that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed over $178 billion to support Ukraine.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The AP News article from February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. Furthermore, the DoD OIG audit revealed that the DoD did not provide sufficient documentation to support the justification or accuracy of half of the total funds, $1.1 billion. However, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) states that US aid to Ukraine is not a "blank check" and that both Ukrainian and US officials monitor the aid.

The claim that Zelenskyy's statement confirms the US aid is a money laundering operation is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention money laundering.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The AP News article does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. The DoD OIG audit revealed issues with documentation, but the ISW states that US aid is not a "blank check" and is monitored. There is no evidence to support the money laundering claim. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. An AP News article from February 1, 2025, does not mention the amount of U.S. aid received by Ukraine. While a DoD OIG audit revealed documentation issues, the Institute for the Study of War ([ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/fact-sheet-us-assistance-ukraine)) states that US aid is not a "blank check" and is monitored. There is no evidence to support the money laundering claim.
