From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025): 
Content: "Russia has leveled some Ukrainian cities as it has attacked and occupied them, such as Mariupol.\[4\] Cities throughout the 80 percent of Ukraine that Russian forces have not occupied have remained largely intact during Russia's invasion, apart from deliberate Russian strikes against critical and civilian infrastructure.\[5\]

**Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections in wartime (unlike the US Constitution, which requires it).**

Ukraine's Constitution prevents the Ukrainian government from holding elections or amending the constitution in times of martial law.\[6\]

Russia triggered Ukraine's martial law provisions when it launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian government cannot constitutionally suspend martial law while Russia continues to attack Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition politicians, including those who have historically run against Zelensky, have stated that holding elections under martial law would be both illegal and immoral.\[7\]

**Ukraine has not suffered millions of losses.**

Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses by any reliable estimate, either in terms of civilian or military casualties.

Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers since the start of the full-scale invasion, and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action.\[8\]

US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000, but no reputable source places casualty estimates near or in the millions.\[9\]

The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.\[10\]

**Europe provides about as much direct aid to Ukraine as the United States.**

Europe (including European Union \[EU\] members and EU institutions plus Norway and the UK) has overtaken the United States in terms of cumulative direct (military and non-military) aid allocations to Ukraine (not counting the costs of US forces forward-deployed in Eastern Europe).\[11\]

*   Europe has provided Ukraine with a total of $166 billion in cumulative aid and pledged an additional $34.7 billion to be allocated through 2030.\[12\]
*   Europe has provided and pledged approximately $204.1 billion in all — over $174 billion from the EU, $13.9 billion from Norway, and $16.2 billion from the UK — compared to America's $183 billion.\[13\]
*   These figures do not include the EU and G7 commitments to provide loans to Ukraine financed by income generated from frozen Russian assets.

**European loans to Ukraine are backed by income from frozen Russian assets, not Ukraine.**

The EU is contributing $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that are backed by extraordinary revenues from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, not Ukraine.\[14\]

*   The EU holds approximately $220.5 billion in Russian frozen assets.\[15\]
*   The EU has already made available $1.6 billion for Ukraine from immobilized Russian assets and disbursed $3.2 billion in loans in January 2025.

**Ukraine did not misuse or lose half of the aid the United States has provided.**

The majority of the funds the United States has allocated for Ukraine stays in the United States to fund domestic defense industrial base and replenish US stockpiles.\[16\]

US government agencies closely oversee the remaining US aid, which is directly issued to Ukraine. <image:3606>**](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/UKR%20support%20fact%20sheet%2C%20February%2021%2C%202025%20PDF%201.pdf)

**Zelensky does not imminently risk losing all of Ukraine.**

Russian forces currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukraine, leaving the remaining 80 percent of the country under Ukraine's sovereign control.

At the current rate of advance, it would take Russian forces over 83 years to capture the remaining 80 percent of Ukraine, assuming that they can sustain massive personnel losses indefinitely.

Russia's rate of advance on the frontline has slowed significantly over the past three months.\[1\]

Russian forces are making small territorial gains at the cost of massive personnel losses.\[2\]

Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 27.94 square kilometers per day in November 2024, 18.1 square kilometers per day in December 2024, and 16.1 square kilometers per day in January 2025.\[3\]

**Most Ukrainian cities have not been destroyed.**

Many of Ukraine's largest cities, including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa, have avoided destruction and continue to function. The US Department of Defense (DoD) Office of the Inspector General reported on January 11, 2024, that it had found no evidence of misappropriated aid.\[17\]

**Ukraine repeatedly invited Putin to negotiate in early 2022.**

Zelensky proposed to meet with Putin on February 19, 2022 — just five days before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\[18\] Putin ignored this request and invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\[19\]

Zelensky called for direct talks with Putin "in any format" in March 2022 and offered to compromise on Ukraine's accession into NATO.\[20\] The Russians demanded the full surrender and demilitarization of Ukraine.\[21\]

Zelensky also expressed openness to discussing the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on the condition that the Ukrainian people would ratify any deal through a referendum.\[22\] Putin rejected that offer as well.

From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine): 
Content: "More recently, Ukraine’s Kursk offensive illustrated the benefit of attacking with surprise against unprepared defenders, as Ukrainian troops advanced roughly 30 kilometers into Russia in three weeks, an average of approximately 1,250 meters per day.

Russia’s slow and limited advances since January 2024 are most comparable to Ukraine’s own offensive in the summer and fall of 2023, which managed to push forward at a rate of just 90 meters per day against heavily fortified Russian positions.

Figure 4 illustrates these trends by comparing the average rates of advance for major operations in Ukraine since 2022 alongside historical benchmarks from World War I, World War II, and the Yom Kippur War. While some policymakers and experts argue that Russia holds “all the cards” in the Ukraine war, the data suggests that the Russian military has performed relatively poorly on the battlefield._

There has been a growing chorus of policymakers and analysts who argue that the Russian military holds the initiative in the war in Ukraine and will likely triumph. academic contended, “the United States and the West more generally and Ukraine have lost in the war over Ukraine,” and “the Russians are going to win.”1 Dmytro Kuleba, a former Ukrainian foreign minister, remarked that unless the current trajectory changes, “we will lose this war.”2 In addition, some U.S. I think that people in Ukraine need to realize what is going on.”4 Andrei Kartapolov, head of the defense committee in the Duma, Russia’s lower legislative chamber, followed Putin’s comments with threats that if Ukraine did not accede to Russia’s maximalist demands in peace negotiations, Ukrainian leaders would be forced to listen to “the language of the Russian bayonet.”5

To better understand the state of the war and Russia’s battlefield performance, this analysis asks: How successful has the Russian military been in achieving the Kremlin’s objectives? Even more noteworthy, Russian equipment losses have been significantly higher than Ukrainian losses, varying between a ratio of 5:1 and 2:1 in Ukraine’s favor.

Fourth, Russian fatalities and casualties have been extraordinary. To put these numbers into historical perspective, Russia has suffered roughly five times as many fatalities in Ukraine as in all Russian and Soviet wars _combined_ between the end of World War II and the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. In addition, Russian fatalities in Ukraine (in just over three years) are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union’s decade-long war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia’s 13 years of war in Chechnya.6

> Increased sanctions on Russia and continuing U.S. and European military assistance to Ukraine would likely raise the costs for Moscow of a protracted war and could facilitate peace talks.

Russia’s poor performance has likely been caused by several factors: the Russian military’s reliance on dismounted infantry and mechanized forces to take Ukrainian territory, Russia’s failure to use operational fires in a coordinated way that enables maneuver, and Ukraine’s effective utilization of defense in depth. The first examines Russian objectives and the Russian way of war in Ukraine. 
 

**The Russian Way of War**
--------------------------

Vladimir Putin’s primary objective is likely to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere of influence, either directly by militarily conquering and annexing Ukraine or indirectly by installing a Russian ally in Kyiv."

Content: "**Russian losses in the war with Ukraine.**  
Mediazona count, updated
======================================================================

_Mediazona_, working with the _BBC’s_ Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling and maintaining a named list of the Russian military dead. This statistical method, created in collaboration with _Meduza_, helps to account for the limitations of relying solely on publicly reported deaths.

About our reports
-----------------

This publication is divided into two parts:

**Bi-weekly Summary.** A text summary, updated every two weeks, in which we report on what we have learned about recent losses and the frontline events that led to the deaths of Russian soldiers.

**Interactive Infographics.** The second part provides visualisations of the losses since the start of the war, showing, for example, where the dead served or which regions they came from. We update the data for these graphics, while the accompanying text is refreshed but remains largely the same.

A detailed description of our method for estimating total deaths using Probate Registry data can be [found at this link](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k-trl)
.

**Last update to the named list:** August 29, 2025.

**Last update to the Probate Registry estimate:** August 29, 2025; estimate as of August 2025

Full named list of verified losses is available here: [**200.zona.media**](https://200.zona.media)

For this summary, we, in collaboration with _Meduza_, have updated our estimate of the actual number of deaths based on the Probate Registry (for more on the method, see [our first publication](https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats-trl)
).

Our analysis shows that **by August 2025, around 220,000 Russian men between 18 and 55 had been killed in the war.**

In our work with the Probate Registry, we found that male mortality reached a new peak in November 2024, at approximately **3,000 deaths per week.**

We cannot yet say with absolute certainty that losses were this high at the end of 2024. These are absolute figures and have not been adjusted for population or number of military units.

You can filter the map to show total losses, losses by branch of service, or the home regions of mobilised soldiers who were killed.

In most cases, official reports or visual cues like uniforms and insignia allow us to determine a soldier’s branch of service, or how he came to be in the army (mobilised, volunteer, prisoner, etc.).

The chart below compares these different groups of servicemen.

From early summer and into the mid-fall season of 2022, volunteers bore the brunt of the losses, which is strikingly different from the situation in the initial stage of the war: in winter and early spring, the Airborne Forces suffered the greatest damage, followed by the Motorised Rifle troops.

By the end of 2022 and the beginning of the next year, losses among prisoners recruited into the _Wagner PMC_ increased markedly. It is also possible that many of these losses were simply invisible to our open-source counting methods.

One likely explanation is the huge number of lawsuits that began flooding Russian courts in the second half of 2024, seeking to have soldiers officially declared missing in action or deceased.

_Mediazona_ [has reported](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/06/05/mia)
 on this process in detail. They were formed into “assault groups” to overwhelm Ukrainian positions near Bakhmut.

By March 2023, prisoners became the largest category of war losses. By November 2024, this figure had dropped to between 2–3%—a shift that reflects both evolving combat tactics and the intensive recruitment of volunteer infantry, who suffer casualty rates many times higher than their commanding officers.

**Officers killed in Ukraine**

To date, the deaths of 12 Russian generals have been officially confirmed: three Lieutenant Generals, seven Major Generals, and two who had retired from active service.

Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov, deputy commander of the Southern Military District, [was killed](https://www.fontanka.ru/2023/07/12/72489656/)
 in July 2023. Of course, this list is not exhaustive, as not every death is publicly reported.

To build a more complete picture of the war’s true toll, we have developed an estimate based on excess male mortality, using data from the national Probate Registry. The data from the very end of the year sits on the edge of where our model’s accuracy begins to decrease.

However, this surge is clear to see in a reliable indicator: the ratio of probate cases opened for men compared to those for women, as female mortality has not been affected by the war.

! They are, however, visible in the mortality estimate.

By the start of August, Russian courts had received **around 50,000 such** **military-related claims**."

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). The fact sheet mentions that Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties to control four regions of Ukraine ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). However, the Russia Matters report card from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured as of January 2025.

Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 were killed by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The Center for Strategic and International Studies indicates that Russian fatalities are extraordinarily high, exceeding those of previous conflicts ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)).

The claim's veracity depends on whether "lost" refers to casualties (killed, wounded, missing) or only killed. The evidence provides different estimates, and the exact number of losses as of February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting estimates regarding Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war as of February 2025. While some sources suggest figures around the claimed 1.5 million, others provide significantly lower numbers. The term "lost" is also ambiguous, as it could refer to killed, wounded, or missing. Due to the lack of a definitive figure for February 2025 and the conflicting information, the claim cannot be fully verified. `not enough information`

The claim's veracity depends on whether "lost" refers to casualties (killed, wounded, missing) or only killed. The evidence provides different estimates, and the exact number of losses as of February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025.

Mediazona's estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)) is significantly lower. The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.

The claim's accuracy depends on the definition of "lost" (killed, wounded, missing) and the specific timeframe. The available data does not provide a definitive answer.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
As of August 21, 2025, the Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)) states that a British Army official estimated that Russia would suffer 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions of Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine War Report Card from Russia Matters, dated February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured as of January 2025, with 48,000 missing (<image:k>).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). The fact sheet mentions that Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. The fact sheet is available for download (<image:3605>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Center for Strategic and International Studies ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)) reports that Russia's fatalities in Ukraine are extraordinarily high, exceeding the combined fatalities of all Russian and Soviet wars from the end of World War II to February 2022. These fatalities are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia's war in Chechnya.

Mediazona ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), in an article updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also notes a peak in male mortality in November 2024, with approximately 3,000 deaths per week.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties to control four regions of Ukraine ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). However, the Russia Matters report card from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured as of January 2025.
