The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Vladimir Putin died in a limousine explosion is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of a fire and explosion involving a limousine from Putin's fleet, there is no confirmation that Putin was in the vehicle or that he died. Furthermore, there are official statements and recent publications attributed to Putin, contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
