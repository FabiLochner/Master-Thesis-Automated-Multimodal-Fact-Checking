## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Human Rights Watch published an article on July 11, 2024, about the Russian attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which killed at least 42 civilians, including five children. The hospital's director reported severe damage to several departments, including intensive care units and oncology and surgical wings. The United Nations website reports on a Security Council meeting discussing the Russian Federation's attack on a Ukrainian children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, which severely damaged the intensive care, surgical, and oncology wards of the Okhmatdyt childrenâ€™s hospital.

The Wikipedia article "8 July 2024 Russian strikes on Ukraine" describes a missile attack on Kyiv, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kropyvnytskyi, and Pokrovsk, resulting in at least 47 deaths and 189 injuries. The Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv was hit. The Russian defence ministry claimed the strikes targeted defense industry targets and aviation bases. The UN, NGOs, and several countries condemned the attacks. The article includes images of the Okhmatdyt children's hospital after the attack.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. The attack resulted in severe damage and casualties. The provided image shows a scene of destruction, with rubble and what appears to be children's toys.

The claim suggests that the toys were photoshopped. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as forensic analysis of the image or eyewitness accounts.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
NPR published an article about the Russian missile strike on the children's hospital in Kyiv, including an image of the damaged hospital (![image 7459](media/2025-08-30_07-45-1756539910-426540.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The new evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/dozens-hurt-childrens-hospital-damaged-in-russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv): 
Content: Al Jazeera reported on a Russian missile attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack. ![image 7463](media/2025-08-30_07-45-1756539927-239562.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked. The image search results show various images of the aftermath of the attack, but none of them show the same scene as the image in the claim. The new evidence does not provide any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that a children's hospital in Kyiv was attacked on July 8, 2024. However, the provided image's authenticity, specifically the presence of the toys, cannot be verified with the available evidence. The image search results do not show the same scene as the image in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While multiple sources confirm the attack on a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8, 2024, the provided evidence does not offer any information about the authenticity of the toys in the image, nor does it show the same scene as the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim that the toys were photoshopped cannot be substantiated.
