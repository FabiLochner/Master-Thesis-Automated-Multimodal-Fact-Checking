The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States. While there are reports of corruption and arms trafficking concerns, the provided sources, including those from the [Defense Security Cooperation Agency](https://www.dsca.mil/Press-Media/Major-Arms-Sales/Article-Display/Article/4289280/ukraine-air-delivered-munitions), [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-weapons-sale-trump-russia-74e01123c0067d5fc160141e0cabf207), and [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/how-much-us-aid-going-ukraine), focus on U.S. aid, arms sales to Ukraine, and tracking military aid, without any data on the alleged sales.

So, the overall veracity is: false
