## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
As of August 21, 2025, the Wikipedia article "Casualties of the Russo-Ukrainian War" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)) states that a British Army official estimated that Russia would suffer 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties to control four regions of Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine War Report Card from Russia Matters, dated February 26, 2025, estimates that over 700,000 Russian troops have been killed or injured as of January 2025, with 48,000 missing (<image:k>).

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a fact sheet on February 21, 2025, stating that Ukraine has not suffered "millions" of losses ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/ukraine-fact-sheet-february-21-2025)). The fact sheet mentions that Zelensky stated on February 16, 2025, that Russia has killed 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and that Ukraine has suffered over 390,000 soldiers wounded in action. US officials have placed the number of Ukrainian military losses between 60,000 and 70,000. The UN confirmed that Russia had killed over 12,000 Ukrainian civilians as of the end of 2024. The fact sheet is available for download (![image 3605](media/2025-08-22_22-18-1755901104-182758.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Center for Strategic and International Studies ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)) reports that Russia's fatalities in Ukraine are extraordinarily high, exceeding the combined fatalities of all Russian and Soviet wars from the end of World War II to February 2022. These fatalities are 15 times larger than the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan and 10 times larger than Russia's war in Chechnya.

Mediazona ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)), in an article updated on August 29, 2025, estimates that around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 had been killed in the war by August 2025. The article also notes a peak in male mortality in November 2024, with approximately 3,000 deaths per week.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is plausible but not definitively confirmed. A British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million Russian casualties to control four regions of Ukraine ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). However, the Russia Matters report card from February 26, 2025, estimates over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured as of January 2025.

Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian men aged 18-55 were killed by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The Center for Strategic and International Studies indicates that Russian fatalities are extraordinarily high, exceeding those of previous conflicts ([Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-battlefield-woes-ukraine)).

The claim's veracity depends on whether "lost" refers to casualties (killed, wounded, missing) or only killed. The evidence provides different estimates, and the exact number of losses as of February 2025 is not explicitly stated.

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties, this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)). The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025.

Mediazona's estimate of 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)) is significantly lower. The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.

The claim's accuracy depends on the definition of "lost" (killed, wounded, missing) and the specific timeframe. The available data does not provide a definitive answer.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting estimates regarding Russian troop losses in the Ukraine war. While some sources suggest high casualty figures, the exact number of 1.5 million losses by February 2025 is not directly supported. The estimates vary, and the definition of "lost" is unclear.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Russia lost 1.5 million troops by February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence. While a British Army official estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War)), this was for controlling four regions, not necessarily losses by February 2025. The Russia Matters report card estimated over 700,000 Russian troops killed or injured by January 2025. Mediazona estimates around 220,000 Russian deaths by August 2025 ([Source](https://en.zona.media/article/2025/08/29/casualties_eng-trl)). The evidence suggests a wide range of estimates, and the claim's specific figure is not confirmed.
