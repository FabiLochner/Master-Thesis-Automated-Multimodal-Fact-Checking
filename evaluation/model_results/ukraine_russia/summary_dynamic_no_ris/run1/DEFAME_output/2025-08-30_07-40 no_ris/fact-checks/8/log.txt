Content: The Global Times published an article about the Red Cross Society of China providing aid to Ukraine. <image:7424>

Useful result: From [Source](https://english.news.cn/europe/20220314/07b8d555e3c046e88968c655b0141bd3/c.html): 
Content: The search result from Xinhua News Agency shows boxes of humanitarian aid from the Red Cross Society of China for Ukraine. <image:7426>

The claim '<image:6> This image shows the Chinese Communist Party's Red Cross troops in Russia who have changed into winter clothes and set off for the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia in rescuing its occupied territories.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Chinese Red Cross provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, there is no evidence to support the claim that Chinese Red Cross troops were deployed to the Russian-Ukrainian front to aid Russia. The provided evidence shows the Red Cross providing aid in the form of supplies, not troops.

So, the overall veracity is: false
