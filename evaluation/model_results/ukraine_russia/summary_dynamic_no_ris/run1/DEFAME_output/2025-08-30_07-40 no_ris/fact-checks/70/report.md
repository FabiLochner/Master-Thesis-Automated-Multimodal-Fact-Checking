## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Fact Crescendo states that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA, and the claim is unfounded. The BBC article discusses the war in Ukraine and Putin's goals, including "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine, and mentions that Putin has not agreed to peace talks with Zelensky. ![image 2683](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600381-299632.jpg), ![image 2687](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600382-650890.jpg), ![image 2689](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600383-197837.jpg), ![image 2681](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600380-944590.jpg), ![image 2685](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600382-179147.jpg) The Journal of Democracy article discusses Putin's hostile policies towards the United States and his invocation of the NATO threat as justification. ![image 2694](media/2025-08-07_20-59-1754600386-245360.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the USA. Fact Crescendo explicitly states that the claim is unfounded. While the Journal of Democracy discusses Putin's hostile policies towards the United States, it does not mention a declaration of war.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources confirms that there has been no official declaration of war by Russia against the United States. The claim is therefore demonstrably false.

`false`
