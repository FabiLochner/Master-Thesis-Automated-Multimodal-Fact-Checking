Useful result: From [Source](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/09/27/zelensky-steps-into-the-us-presidential-election_6727450_4.html): 
Content: Le Monde reports on a joint speech between Kamala Harris and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on September 26, 2024, which signaled Zelenskyy's involvement in the US election campaign. <image:3366> Harris reaffirmed political and military support for Ukraine.

The claim 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy engaged in election interference by campaigning in Pennsylvania for Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not definitively proven. While Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Pennsylvania and gave a joint speech with Kamala Harris, which some interpreted as involvement in the US election campaign, there is no explicit evidence that he campaigned for her.

So, the overall veracity is: false
