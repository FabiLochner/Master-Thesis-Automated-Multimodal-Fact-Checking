## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published a fact-check by Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson from PolitiFact discussing Donald Trump's claim that Ukraine started the war with Russia, stating that Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The article mentions Volodymyr Zelenskyy's response to Trump's claim (<image:0>). VOA News reported that the Russian Ambassador to the UK falsely claimed that Zelenskyy started the war, which began in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine.

The Wikipedia article "Russian invasion of Ukraine" states that the war began on February 24, 2022, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including a timeline of events and mentioning the conflict's start in 2014. The article also mentions Zelenskyy's announcement of a counteroffensive (<image:k>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article provides a timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, starting before February 24, 2022, and continuing through 2025, mentioning key events such as the initial invasion on February 24, 2022, and the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensives. The article also references a Russian military buildup since early 2021 and Russian demands for security measures. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine)

U.S. News & World Report published a timeline of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including events from November 2013 to December 2022, mentioning Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and a visit by Zelenskyy to the White House in October 2022 <image:k>.

## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that the war began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Multiple sources, including Al Jazeera and Wikipedia, confirm this.
2.  The evidence also shows that the conflict has a longer history, with events dating back to 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine.
3.  There is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war. In fact, the evidence suggests the opposite, with Russia initiating the invasion.


## Final Judgement
The evidence clearly indicates that Russia initiated the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the conflict has a history dating back to 2014. There is no evidence to support the claim that Zelenskyy started the war; instead, the evidence points to Russia's actions as the cause.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Multiple sources, including [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/1/fact-check-did-ukraine-start-the-war-with-russia) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), confirm that Russia initiated the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The conflict's origins can be traced back to 2014, with no evidence supporting Zelenskyy's role in starting the war.
