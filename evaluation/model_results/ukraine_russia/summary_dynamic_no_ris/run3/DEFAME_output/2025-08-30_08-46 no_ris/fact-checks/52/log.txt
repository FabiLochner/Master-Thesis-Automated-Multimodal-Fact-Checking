The claim 'After a call with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on February 12, 2025, US President Donald Trump announced that he had reached an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.' is false.
Justification: Following a phone call on February 12, 2025, between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, peace talks were initiated, as documented on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_phone_call) and the [Kremlin website](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/76259). However, the evidence, including reporting from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5331887/trump-putin-ukraine-call), indicates that an agreement to end the war was not reached on that date, but rather, talks towards a ceasefire were agreed upon later, on March 18, 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
