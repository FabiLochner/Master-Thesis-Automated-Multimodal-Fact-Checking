Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/24/politics/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee): 
Content: The CNN article, published on January 25, 2023, reports that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy denied Adam Schiff a seat on the House Intelligence Committee. McCarthy cited the "misuse of this panel" during the 116th and 117th Congresses as the reason. The article mentions Schiff's role in the impeachments of former President Donald Trump. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1151335616/mccarthy-democrats-schiff-swalwell-intelligence-committee-assignments): 
Content: The NPR article from January 25, 2023, reports that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blocked Adam Schiff from serving on the House Intelligence Committee. <image:8736> McCarthy stated that Schiff's actions undermined national security. Schiff believes the move is political retribution for his role in the impeachment of Donald Trump. The article does not mention John Thune.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-led-house-poised-to-censure-schiff-over-trump-russia-investigations): 
Content: The PBS article discusses a censure resolution against Adam Schiff for comments about investigations into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. The article mentions that Schiff was the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment trial and has been a target of Republicans. The article also mentions that McCarthy blocked Schiff from the House intelligence committee.

The claim 'Majority Leader John Thune blocked Senator Adam Schiff's committee assignments because of his past work in the Russia investigation over Donald Trump.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including CNN and NPR, indicates that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, not John Thune, denied Adam Schiff a seat on the House Intelligence Committee. The reasons cited were related to Schiff's actions, not his past work on the Russia investigation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
