Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/europe/russia-ukraine-kursk-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article about the situation in the Kursk region. The article includes an image of military vehicles. <image:8490>

The claim '<image:7> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arriving in August 2024 in the Sudzha of Kursk region, Russia, which had just been occupied by Ukrainian troops in the Kursk Offensive, and meeting with representatives of the people there.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While evidence confirms the Kursk region and Sudzha were areas of conflict during the Kursk Offensive in August 2024, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Volodymyr Zelensky in Sudzha during that time.

So, the overall veracity is: false
