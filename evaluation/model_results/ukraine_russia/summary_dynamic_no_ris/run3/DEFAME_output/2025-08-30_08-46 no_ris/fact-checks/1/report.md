An article from [gwaramedia.com](https://gwaramedia.com/en/debunking-russian-fakes-no-zelenskyy-didnt-buy-villa-on-island-of-billionaires/) debunks a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa on Saint Barthelemy island, stating that the presented document is fake. ![image 1552](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592492-084293.jpg), ![image 1553](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592495-928314.jpg), ![image 1554](media/2025-08-07_18-48-1754592496-123937.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Kehlsteinhaus, also known as the Eagle's Nest, is located in Obersalzberg near Berchtesgaden, Germany. It was completed in 1938 and commissioned by the Nazi Party. The building currently operates as a restaurant, beer garden, and tourist destination. The Bavarian government relinquished control of the building to a trust in 1960.

## Elaboration
The claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest is disputed. One source states the claim is false, and the Free State of Bavaria still owns the Kehlsteinhaus. Another source claims that Zelenskyy purchased the Eagle's Nest for €14.2 million. The Kehlsteinhaus is currently a tourist destination and is operated by a trust. The evidence also includes a debunking of a claim that Zelenskyy purchased a villa, which was proven to be a fake document. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain.
