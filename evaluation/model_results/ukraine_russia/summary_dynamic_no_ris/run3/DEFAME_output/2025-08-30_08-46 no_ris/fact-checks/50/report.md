## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, Reuters published an article where German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated that there must be no peace in Ukraine over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans (<image:k>). The Guardian reported on February 12, 2025, that Baerbock said Ukraine’s interests must be protected in the upcoming negotiations between Moscow and Washington (![image 1007](media/2025-08-06_18-20-1754504425-007992.jpg)). A Wikipedia article discusses the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy Oval Office meeting on February 28, 2025, and mentions that Baerbock said Trump's conduct represented a "new era of ruthlessness" (<image:i>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
In February 2025, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for increased pressure on the U.S. regarding its stance on Ukraine and mentioned severing ties, according to an article from Izvestia (![image 1048](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504540-201404.jpg)). Press TV reported that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US under Donald Trump to prevent a US-Russia alliance, particularly regarding the war in Ukraine (![image 1049](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504545-769933.jpg), ![image 1050](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504546-657955.jpg)). However, a fact-check from aol.com states that the claim that Baerbock threatened to cut diplomatic ties with the US is misleading (![image 1023](media/2025-08-06_18-22-1754504528-288037.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. While Izvestia reports that Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US, a fact-check from aol.com states that this claim is misleading. Press TV indicates that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the contradictory nature of the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. Some sources report that Baerbock threatened to sever ties, while others, including a fact-check, dispute this. Therefore, the claim's accuracy cannot be definitively determined. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is disputed. While some sources, such as Izvestia, report that German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock threatened to sever ties with the US in February 2025, other sources, including a fact-check from aol.com, consider this claim misleading. Additionally, Press TV reports that Baerbock urged European allies to pressure the US. Therefore, the evidence is contradictory, making it impossible to definitively verify the claim.
