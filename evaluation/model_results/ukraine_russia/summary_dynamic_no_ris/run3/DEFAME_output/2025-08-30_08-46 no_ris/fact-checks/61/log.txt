Content: The Economic Times reports that a luxury limousine from Vladimir Putin's official car fleet exploded in central Moscow. The article mentions that the explosion has raised security concerns and that a video of the burning limousine has gone viral on social media.

The claim 'Russian President Vladimir Putin has died in an explosion in one of his limousines.' is false.
Justification: While reports from sources like Newsweek, The Hindustan Times, and The Economic Times indicate an incident involving a limousine from Vladimir Putin's fleet, including a fire and an explosion, none of the provided evidence confirms the claim that Putin died in an explosion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
