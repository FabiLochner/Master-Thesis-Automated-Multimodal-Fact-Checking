## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to Eurovision News | Spotlight ([https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy)), the claim that the shells were Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza is false. The video and images show Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs, where he wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on the shells.
