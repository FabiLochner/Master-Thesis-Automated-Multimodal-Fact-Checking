## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the 2019 Trump–Ukraine scandal, including allegations of withholding aid to Ukraine and requests for investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal)). Newsweek published an article discussing the claim that Ukraine sent billions of dollars from foreign aid to FTX, which was then sent back to the Democratic party, stating that the claim is unevidenced ([https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774](https://www.newsweek.com/what-behind-claim-joe-biden-laundered-billions-ukraine-aid-via-ftx-1759774)).

The Associated Press published a fact check stating that the claim "Half of all US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates for re-election" is false ([https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ftx-ukraine-democrats-laundering-996663874380)). The article explains that Aid For Ukraine worked with FTX to convert cryptocurrency donations into Ukraine’s government-issued currency, a partnership that ended in April 2022. ![image 2147](media/2025-08-07_20-01-1754596899-160228.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) provides a fact sheet on US assistance to Ukraine, refuting the claim that US aid lacks oversight and is being misused because of corruption. The fact sheet states that US oversight is extensive and Ukrainian government oversight and accountability are extensive and growing. The fact sheet also states that America’s European, Asian, and NATO allies have committed more money to support Ukraine than the United States. The fact sheet also argues that Ukraine is not a "forever war" for the United States and that sending military aid to Ukraine increases America’s military readiness. The fact sheet also states that the United States has not given Ukraine a blank check.

The BBC reports that Ukraine's security service has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m.

The officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022, but no arms were ever provided. [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68120973)


## Elaboration
The claim is demonstrably false. The Associated Press and Newsweek both debunk the claim that US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent to Democrat candidates. The AP specifically states the claim is false. The evidence also shows that there have been allegations of corruption in Ukraine, but not specifically related to the laundering of US aid to Democrat candidates.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including the Associated Press and Newsweek, refutes the claim that half of US aid to Ukraine was laundered and sent back to Democrat candidates. The AP explicitly labels the claim as false.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE
