*   Zelenskiy-Trump White House spat hit U.S.-Ukraine ties

*   Ukrainians are rallying round Zelenskiy, pollster says

KYIV, March 7 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's approval rating has risen by 10 percentage points since his White House spat with U.S. But in the east Zelenskiy's trust ratings were lower - at about 60%.

Ukraine's eastern regions are where the fiercest fighting is taking place, with Russian troops devastating cities and towns and taking village after village.

The poll showed that 29% of respondents did not trust Zelenskiy at the start of March, down from 37% at the start of February.

This was presented at the time as a necessary step to sign a peace agreement.

The statement did not surprise anyone in Kyiv, given the Russian president's habit of questioning Zelensky's legitimacy."

The president said he would conduct opinion polls for trust ratings for world leaders, including Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Zelenskyy said he took Trump's comments "calmly."

"As for President Trump, with all due respect to him as a leader of the American people, who we deeply respect and are thankful for all his support, but President Trump, unfortunately, is living in this disinformation space," Zelenskyy continued.

There is currently no politician in Ukraine considered to have stronger support than Zelenskyy. and has not yet entered politics.

 concluded in Saudi Arabia, Trump suggested to reporters at Mar-a-Lago that Zelenskyy's alleged low public approval meant the country should hold a new presidential election, its 2024 contest having been postponed because Ukraine has been under martial law since Putin's invasion three years ago.

"That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also," Trump said.

Trump's claims indicated that he -- like Putin -- may now be seeking Zelenskyy's removal as part of any deal to end the war.

Putin appears to see removing Zelenskyy as a key goal, both as a victory he can present to Russians and as a potential opportunity to install a pro-Russian leader in his place. <image:360>

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gives a press conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Feb. The most recent, published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in early February, showed that 57% of respondents said they trusted Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy's level of support is diminished from the extraordinary highs of earlier in the war. The February poll did show a 5% bump in trust from December 2024.

Still, the 50% or more regularly scored by Zelenskyy in various polls is higher than those achieved by many democratic leaders around the world.

Aides in Kyiv were quick to point out on Wednesday that Zelenskyy's recent score of 57% in the KIIS poll was higher than Trump's backing in recent U.S. That is why the Russian president is pushing for elections to be held before any final peace deal.

Zelenskyy pushed back firmly on Wednesday, fact-checking Trump and saying he was suffering from exposure to Russian disinformation.

"If someone wants to replace me right now, then right now it won't work," the president told reporters in Kyiv before a planned meeting with Trump's Ukraine-Russia envoy Keith Kellogg.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) states that Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025. However, the same source indicates that polls showed the approval rating was over 50% at that time. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiys-approval-rating-rises-ukraine-after-trump-spat-poll-shows-2025-03-07/)) reported that Zelenskyy's approval rating rose to 67% in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy's approval rating was down at 4% in February 2025 is not accurate based on the available evidence.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595](https://abcnews.go.com/International/zelenskyy-4-approval-trump-claims-50/story?id=118959595)) states that Trump claimed Zelenskyy's approval rating was 4% in February 2025.

Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy's approval rating was down at 4% in February 2025 is not accurate based on the available evidence.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially accurate as it mentions the 4% approval rating, but it is misleading because it does not include the fact that polls showed a much higher approval rating. The evidence indicates that while someone claimed the approval rating was 4%, the actual approval rating was much higher.

From 9 Dec 2024

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)

*   **Volodymyr Zelenskyy** today made the case for a diplomatic settlement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the Nato military alliance. We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader told reporters he was hoping [to call outgoing US president Joe Biden in the coming days](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3#block-6756d0808f08d291b219b7e3)
 to discuss Nato membership.

!Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks during his meeting with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,” Merz told Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital today.

“With these range limits, we are forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back,” he added.

Ukraine will soon get another €4.2bn ($4.4bn; £3.5bn) in funds after the EU’s member states approved the planned payment of the money, [the EU council has announced](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/12/09/council-approves-second-payment-of-over-42-billion-under-the-ukraine-facility/)
.

The money, which forms part of the EU’s [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 facility, will help the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by a reduction in exports and the closure of many businesses owing to Russia’s war.

The EU council wants the money allocated to Ukraine as quickly as possible “given the difficult fiscal situation in Ukraine”.

The G7 group of the world’s biggest economies have earmarked an overall loan of €47.3bn ($50bn; £39bn) for Ukraine, serviced by profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the west.

We have some more comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at [the joint press conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-donald-trump-ceasefire-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy?page=with:block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff#block-6756d7dc8f08cefeb937e8ff)
 with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz in Kyiv.

“Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. A strong Ukraine before any diplomacy means a strong (Ukraine) on the battlefield,” he said, implying Kyiv needed help to become stronger.

Among Zelenskyy’s inner circle, there is an increasing awareness that, as [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 continues to make battlefield gains, some kind of negotiations will be necessary soon.

But the Ukrainian leader wants more weapons from allies – and security guarantees – so he can negotiate with Moscow from a position of strength, if it comes to that.

**Volodymyr Zelenskyy** floated the idea on Monday of foreign troops being deployed to Ukraine until the country joins the **Nato** military alliance.

He made the remark during a joint press conference in Kyiv with the German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, as Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House intensifies talk of a possible deal to end Russia’s 33-month-old war.

Ukraine, which has made a concerted push to obtain an invitation to join Nato, has insisted throughout the war that it needs security guarantees to prevent Russia launching another invasion after the current hostilities are halted.

“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said.

The French president Emmanuel Macron caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus on the matter.

“Even if we get invited \[to Nato\], what happens then? Russian forces have mostly encircled but not yet taken major cities, and few major rail or road arteries have been severed recently._
> 
> _Russian control of Ukrainian territory has increased from 17.4% in November 2023 to 17.9% as of 30 November 2024._
> 
> _Russia has made the most territorial gains in Donetsk, where it has gained 1,804 sq km since the start of the year."

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that he’s open to the potential deployment of Western troops in Ukraine to guarantee the country’s security as part of a broad effort to end [the almost three-year war](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 with Russia.

The deployment would be a step toward Ukraine joining NATO, Zelenskyy said in a post on his Telegram channel.

“But before that, we must have a clear understanding of when Ukraine will be in the European Union and when Ukraine will be in NATO,” Zelenskyy said.

His proposals tread a delicate diplomatic path amid international efforts to find a way of ending Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II at a time when [Russia has gained an upper hand](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-f7f56e494df1dbbcdec1853001796c45)
 in the fighting.

U.S. President Joe Biden about Ukraine’s possible NATO membership because he’s still in office, while Trump doesn’t yet have “legal rights” to decide on the matter.

“He wants to have a cease-fire,” Trump said of Zelenskyy in comments to the New York Post published Sunday. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Putin’s forces are taking heavy losses in Ukraine, Trump noted.

“I’m formulating a concept of how to end that ridiculous war,” he said.

The possibilities of Ukraine joining the 32-nation NATO military alliance and of Western troops being stationed on its soil have been deeply divisive and contentious issues since Russia’s full-scale invasion began on Feb. military [aid of nearly $1 billion](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-weapons-russia-trump-biden-himars-zelenskyy-7b2560ad6bd54a6275da0ceb5241c0e8)

WASHINGTON (AP) — [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 on Sunday pushed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine, describing it as part of his active efforts as president-elect to [end the war](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)
 despite being weeks from taking office.

“Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

In a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and [pulling the United States out of NATO](https://apnews.com/article/trump-nato-presidential-election-congress-republicans-20e902788e8701999ce0424f73d478cc)

, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.

Asked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.

“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he said.

But if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said.

Trump’s call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. 20 inauguration to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.

Trump made his proposal after a [weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders](https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-notre-dame-f97fde62ca2ce68c3874c395b305e26b)
 in Paris, where [many world leaders gathered](https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-notre-dame-f97fde62ca2ce68c3874c395b305e26b)
 to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.

In the NBC interview taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued U.S. arms and other military support are vital to Ukraine’s efforts to fend off invading Russian forces, and Biden has been [surging assistance to Ukraine](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-military-weapons-nuclear-42d5d374faf445b811c6abe422da05eb)
 before leaving office.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday [announced nearly $1 billion more](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-weapons-russia-trump-biden-himars-zelenskyy-7b2560ad6bd54a6275da0ceb5241c0e8)
 in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, [NATO allies](https://apnews.com/article/nato-defense-spending-trump-military-budgets-3cf6e8da6da08cbf84686d0b5f518f5a)
 and many in the U.S. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.

Zelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but has given no further details.

Zelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”

“When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader.

That decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.

Trump’s former national security adviser, retired Lt. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.

Both Trump and President Joe Biden pointed this weekend to [Russia’s disengagement in Syria](https://apnews.com/article/trump-syria-biden-ukraine-russia-putin-assad-cbb3ad1fe14ccd32452aa118140e23cf)

, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russia’s resources.

Biden said at the White House on Sunday that resistance from Ukraine had “left Russia unable to protect its main ally in the Middle East.”

The Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce."

All themes that would have hardly ended up in the final document for the **Milei's fierce opposition**, fresh from a meeting with Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, and intent on denying Buenos Aires' signature on both the tax for the super-rich and the UN's sustainable development goals and gender equality.

A disappointing G20 for Lula's Brazil
-------------------------------------

**For Lula**, already weakened by an all-time low popularity, this G20 could **become a slap in the face**, since he had done everything to dodge the issues related to the conflicts, aware that his position on both Ukraine and the Middle East is not in line with that of NATO and is, if anything, closer to that of China. A historic visit, the first ever by a US president still in office, but which nevertheless was **judged disappointing**: the outgoing president announced the**White House commitment to safeguard** of the largest rainforest on the planet, but he knows full well that the **Trump's successor won't keep his word**, and promised a donation to the Amazon Fund of just 50 million dollars, much less than the half a billion that had been hypothesized some time ago.

Meloni: 40 billion investments in Brazil but Enel problem to be solved
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has also arrived in Rio **Giorgia Meloni**, which has already had a yesterday **bilateral with Lula** in which he said that the **Italian companies** they intend to invest **40 billion euros** in Brazil, recalling the strong ties between the two countries: in the Portuguese-speaking country today live 800.000 Italians and about thirty million descendants of Italians. ### Share

_The summit scheduled in Rio de Janeiro between today and tomorrow should have mainly discussed climate and hunger, but it was overtaken by events. In the bilateral meeting with Lula, Meloni announces Italian investments in Brazil. And instead the host was **overtaken by events**: Russia has stepped up its offensive and Biden has given the green light to the escalation from Manaus, in the Amazon, where he was to meet indigenous leaders on the eve of the summit. Some in the Brazilian political and institutional world have even threatened to terminate the contract: technically it is not possible, but Enel did not make a very good impression, just on the eve of the publication of the accounts.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Lech Walesa expresses fear and distaste at how Trump treats Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

After Friday's contentious meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, the White House was sent a letter. His letter was signed by dozens of other former Polish political prisoners.

ANDRZEJ BOBINKSI: Nobody wants to say anything too vivid, too aggressive towards, you know, Donald Trump and the United States. And I think that, you know, by the end of Donald Trump's term, Poland will be in a very different place.

SCHMITZ: And Walesa's scathing letter, says Bobinski, is a sign of Poland turning away from its longtime friend. As NPR's Central Europe correspondent Rob Schmitz reports, the letter expressed to the Trump administration what the Polish government cannot.

ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE: The letter begins with your excellency Mr. and its historical antipathy towards Russia.

BOBINKSI: Donald Trump is way too lenient and way too friendly towards Vladimir Putin. And I don't think anybody has come out outright and said that we don't want to be friends with the United States anymore.

SCHMITZ: Certainly not Donald Tusk, Poland's prime minister, who made this statement after the Oval Office incident.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRIME MINISTER DONALD TUSK: (Speaking Polish).

SCHMITZ: "I know a narrative is being created, especially after that very strange Friday at the White House," said Tusk, "that would divide Europe and the United States. It goes on to compare Trump and Vance's treatment of Zelenskyy to interrogations by political police under communist Poland, and it demands more respect for a leader whose soldiers are shedding blood to defend the free world. We do not understand, the letter says, how the leader of a country that is a symbol of the free world cannot see that. The author is Lech Walesa, former leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, the first Democratically elected president of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate for his leadership in opposing communist rule. "We cannot allow that to happen," he said."

WARSAW — Poland’s democracy hero Lech Walesa and dozens of other former political prisoners in Poland have written a letter to President Trump, telling him that his treatment of Ukraine’s president at the Oval Office last week filled them “with horror and distaste.”

Walesa, who served as president soon after Poland embraced democracy, and the others tell Trump that they found it offensive that he expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to show respect and gratitude for the materiel assistance the United States has given Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

The law, adopted August 20, 2024, prohibits the Russian Orthodox Church from operating in Ukraine and bans any religious organization in Ukraine with ties to it or any other religious organizations based in countries “engaged in armed aggression against Ukraine.” It authorizes the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience to identify links between Ukrainian religious organizations andthe Russian Orthodox Church.

A Ukrainian flag in the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Kozelets, Chernihivska region, on May 14, 2022 ©2022 Sergei SUPINSKY / AFP

(Kyiv, October 30, 2024) – [Ukraine’s](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/ukraine)
 new [law](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/3894-IX)
 banning religious organizations with ties to the [Russian](https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/russia)
 Orthodox Church is overly broad and could have far-reaching consequences for Ukrainians’ right to religious freedom, Human Rights Watch said today. He noted that there are Ukrainian Orthodox Church congregations in occupied territories that “refuse to join the Russian Orthodox Churchfor many reasons.” He said that the ban would sever the connection with those churches, and that the “Russian Orthodox Church will put their own people in place and that will be the end of it.”

The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has documented multiple incidents in which groups of people forcefully entered churches belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Сhurch, “[justifying their actions](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/ukraine/2024/report-human-rights-situation-ukraine-1-dec-2023-29-feb-2024.pdf)
 with decisions from local authorities to register new religious communities of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine at the same address as existing Ukrainian Orthodox Churchcommunities.” In September, Ukraine [blocked](https://cip.gov.ua/ua/news/rozporyadzhennya-ncu-vid-12-09-2024-769-2574-pro-blokuvannya-domennikh-imen)
 the website of the outlet DialogTUT, which covered Ukrainian Orthodox Church activities.

Ukraine is obligated under Ukrainian and international law to guarantee religious freedom. The law does not impact the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities should address any security concerns related to the activities of religious bodies or personnel that threaten state security, whether by individuals or specific religious communities, rather than effectively banning entire religious communities based solely on presumed affiliations with the Russian Orthodox Church, Human Rights Watch said. 

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s security service has initiated criminal proceedings [against](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/get-vid-moskvi-k-radi-zbirayutsya-zaboroniti-1723413259.html)
 at least 100 clergymen, most affiliated with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on charges of “collaborationism,” treason, and“aiding the aggressor state.” 

Broad implementation of the new law risks severe practical consequences for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church’s congregations and millions of parishioners, Human Rights Watch said. It said it would develop regulations to implement the law within three months of its publication, to be approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. 

The law considers any ties, not just institutional and organizational, but also canonical, with the Russian Orthodox Church to be grounds for banning it. 

Requiring the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to sever canonical ties may cast doubt on the legitimacy of its adherents’ religious beliefs, which the European Court of Human Rights has identified as a key element of the right to freedom of religion, Human Rights Watch said. “But the law interferes with the right to freedom of religion and is so broad that it could violate the rights of Ukrainian Orthodox Church members.”

The Ukrainian government should suspend implementation of the law and request the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe’s advisory body on constitutional matters, and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe’s’ Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to provide expert analysis of the law that would be the basis for its rights-respecting revision, Human Rights Watch said.

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church was [established](https://risu.ua/ukrajinska-pravoslavna-cerkva-moskovskogo-patriarhatu_n48337)
 in 1990 as an autonomous branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leadership supports Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet, in January 2023, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience found these steps insufficient, stating that the “status of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as a structural subdivision of the Russian Orthodox Church... remains unchanged.”

The Ukrainian Orthodox Church exists alongside the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which was [established](https://www.pomisna.info/uk/document-post/patriarshyj-i-synodalnyj-tomos-nadannya-avtokefalnogo-tserkovnogo-ustroyu-pravoslavnij-tserkvi-v-ukrayini/)
 in 2019 under the Patriarchate of Constantinople. They range from restrictions on ownership and operation of religious properties to difficulties in accessing places of worship and heightened risk of security service surveillance and prosecution.

Any prosecution or penalty not based on specific, unlawful actions but solely on the adherence to a peaceful practice of faith, constitutes religious discrimination and is prohibited by international human rights law. 

In a written response to questions Human Rights Watch sent on October 2, the State Service of Ukraine for Ethnic Policy and Freedom of Conscience said that the law’s main objective is “to prevent the network of religious organizations officially registered in Ukraine from being used against Ukraine.” 

The agency said that Ukraine “does not demand that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church betray the doctrine of the Orthodox Church, change liturgical practices or language, switch to a different liturgical calendar, or join another church jurisdiction. The only requirement that the Law insists on is withdrawing from the Russian Orthodox Church, which is involved in the war against Ukraine.”

The agency also shared recommendations on measures that could be taken to cut ties with the Russian Orthodox Church."

Published on September 4, 2024

Ukraine has passed a law banning religious organizations with links to Russia. The formal ban is a major moment in a long-running dispute, and will have far-reaching consequences for Ukraine both at home and abroad.

When the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was established in 2018 under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, it was hoped that the UOCMP and the OCU would gradually merge. In any foreign country where there are Ukrainians, there should be our Ukrainian church.” She seems unaware that under canon law, the OCU cannot [open](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/01/can-the-ukrainian-orthodox-church-survive-the-war-with-russia?lang=en)
 parishes outside Ukraine.

Voting on the new law in Ukraine’s parliament revealed some committed opposition to the ban. It has also been criticized by the [Pope](https://www.ncronline.org/vatican/vatican-news/pope-francis-condemns-ukraine-s-ban-russian-orthodox-church)
 and the [World Council of Churches](https://www.oikoumene.org/news/wcc-urges-caution-with-new-law-passed-by-ukrainian-rada)
.  

One of the reasons Kyiv took so long to outlaw the UOCMP was for fear of a hostile reaction from conservatives in the United States. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, for example, [said](https://t.me/vereshchuk_iryna/2430)
 on August 20 that Ukraine should “stop the influence of the harmful Russian church on Ukrainians not only in Ukraine, but also outside its borders. The main target of the law is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOCMP), which was established in 1990 as a self-governing church under the canonical jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC).

The Ukrainian government held back from taking such a step immediately after the full-scale invasion by Russia: after all, the UOCMP is the country’s biggest church. Instead, the continued presence of a religious organization formally affiliated with Moscow has angered patriotic Ukrainians and provoked the suspicion of the authorities.

UOCMP [efforts](https://news.church.ua/2022/05/27/postanova-soboru-ukrajinskoji-pravoslavnoji-cerkvi-vid-27-travnya-2022-roku/#2024-08-22)
 in recent years to show it is independent of Moscow have not convinced officials. As of May 2024, it had [10,587 parishes](https://data.gov.ua/dataset/3d0dc6d8-bc68-4796-a08c-70222258e566)
 in Ukraine compared to the OCU’s 8,075. Between February 2022 and May 2024, just [685 UOCMP parishes](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/skolko-cerkvey-upc-mp-deystvuet-v-ukraine-v-2024-godu-i-skolko-pereshlo-v-pcu-dannye-opendatabot-50415369.html)
 went over to the OCU—and they were mostly in the center and west of the country. The boxer Oleksandr Usyk, for example—one of Ukraine’s most popular sportspeople—is a vocal public [supporter](https://xsport.ua/ru/boxing_s/news/-usik-soobshchil-chto-prodolzhaet-khodit-v-upts-mp_8969480/)
 of the UOCMP.

The international context of the ban is also significant."

 TV station has been accused of labeling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as Russian territory during an Easter broadcast, prompting Ukraine's Foreign Ministry to call for an investigation "if this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement."

Why It Matters
--------------

Moscow has attempted to paint the government in Kyiv as illegitimate, and President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/vladimir-putin)
 penned an extensive essay back in 2021 that called Russia and Ukraine "one people."

Moscow has labeled territory annexed from Ukraine as Russian, and suggested these areas fall under the country's nuclear umbrella.

Ukraine said Russian strikes and assaults along the front lines have continued despite the announcement. Moscow in turn accused Kyiv of violating the ceasefire.

 said Washington could be evaluating in the next few days whether U.S. Russian state media on Sunday referred to Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region as "Novorossiya."

Kremlin spokesperson, [Dmitry Peskov](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/dmitry-peskov)
, said in October 2022 that these Ukrainian regions were "inalienable parts of the Russian Federation."

"Live Now made an unintentional mistake Saturday evening during extensive live coverage of Easter services from around the world," a spokesperson said in response to a _Newsweek_ comment request. We regret and apologize for the mistake."

Easter is the main holiday for Orthodox Christians, although many in Ukraine now mark major holidays like Christmas in line with Western celebrations to distance themselves religious services from Moscow. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has endorsed the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin attended an Easter service at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior, conducted by Patriarch Kirill, late on Saturday.

The Kremlin leader declared on Saturday that Moscow would halt "all military operations" for 30 hours between 6 p.m. teams would be able to [clinch a ceasefire deal in the next few weeks.](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-ceasefire-marco-rubio-russia-putin-zelensky-steve-witkoff-2061408)

Kyiv, under intense pressure from Washington, has already agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal. [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=)

**ISTANBUL**

Ukraine on Sunday called for an apology and an investigation from Fox News over its broadcast on Easter, during which it labeled the country’s capital Kyiv a “Russian city.”

Multiple Ukrainian media outlets, including RBC-Ukraine news agency, reported that Fox News aired footage of Easter services taking place across the globe, including a service in Moscow attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The New York-based television channel also shared footage of services taking place in the Ukrainian capital, which initially labeled the events as taking place in “Kyiv, Ukraine.”

However, the on-screen text later changed to “Kyiv, Russia,” that was reportedly shown for about 20 minutes before it was corrected.

“If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi said on X.

In a statement on X, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the media for "sharing the truth about what is happening" amid the Easter ceasefire declared by Putin a day earlier.

“Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance,” Zelenskyy added.

On Saturday, Putin declared a 30-hour unilateral ceasefire in the ongoing war in Ukraine, arguing that the halt’s success or failure would show Kyiv’s readiness and capacity to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

In response, Zelenskyy said that his country would be mirroring Russia’s actions, expressing that Kyiv proposes extending the halt for 30 days beyond Orthodox Easter “if a complete ceasefire truly takes hold.”

The ceasefire began at 6:00 pm Moscow time and will continue until Monday midnight, though both Moscow and Kyiv have since accused each other of violating it.

A screenshot from Fox New's live broadcast on April 20 in which it incorrectly labeled Ukraine's capital a "Russian city."

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called out Fox News for labeling Kyiv a "Russian city" during its news broadcast.

During its coverage of Easter services on April 20, Fox News aired footage of religious services from around the world, including the service Russian President Vladimir Putin [attended in Moscow](https://kyivindependent.com/putin-attends-easter-service-in-moscow-as-fighting-in-ukraine-continues-despite-ceasefire/)
.

Simultaneously, the right-wing news network broadcast live images from Easter religious services in Kyiv, [misidentifying the Ukrainian capital](https://kyivindependent.com/kyiv-not-kiev-how-ukrainians-reclaimed-their-capital-and-their-future/)
 as a Russian city. The error reportedly remained on screen for 20 minutes.

"If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.

Although he didn't mention them by name, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to also criticize Fox News at the end of a statement on April 20 in which he reported multiple Russian ceasefire violations across the front line since an [Easter ceasefire](https://kyivindependent.com/putin-announces-easter-ceasefire-calls-on-ukraine-to-follow/)
 was declared.

"Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely [commit to a full ceasefire](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-proposes-extending-truce-beyond-easter-sunday/)
," Zelensky wrote.

"We thank all the media, podcasters, bloggers, and everyone sharing the truth about what is happening."

Zelenskyy with NATO secretary general [Jens Stoltenberg](/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg "Jens Stoltenberg")
 in June 2019

During the 2019 presidential campaign, Zelenskyy promised bills to fight [corruption](/wiki/Corruption_in_Ukraine "Corruption in Ukraine")
, including removal of immunity from the [president](/wiki/President_of_Ukraine "President of Ukraine")
, [members](/wiki/People%27s_Deputy_of_Ukraine "People's Deputy of Ukraine")
 of the [Verkhovna Rada](/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada "Verkhovna Rada")
 (Ukraine's national parliament) and judges, a law about impeachment, reform of election laws, and providing efficient trial by jury. He promised to bring the salary for military personnel "to the level of [NATO](/wiki/NATO "NATO")
 standards."[\[349\]](#cite_note-353)

Although Zelenskyy had earlier stated that he prefers elections with [open list](/wiki/Open_list "Open list")
 election ballots (such as in his inauguration speech[\[114\]](#cite_note-inaugurationspeech-118)
), after he called the snap [2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election](/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election "2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election")
, his draft law "On amendments to some laws of Ukraine in connection with the change of the electoral system for the election of people's deputies" proposed to hold the election with closed lists because the 60-day term to the snap election did not "leave any chances for the introduction of this system."[\[115\]](#cite_note-UPclosedlistsrejected-119)
 However, this bill was rejected by parliament.[\[113\]](#cite_note-uawireclosedlists-117)

Zelenskyy and Indian Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](/wiki/Narendra_Modi "Narendra Modi")
 at the [COP26 climate summit](/wiki/United_Nations_Climate_Change_conference "United Nations Climate Change conference")
 in Glasgow, November 2021

Zelenskyy opposed targeting the Russian language in Ukraine and banning artists for their political opinions (such as those viewed by the Government as [anti-Ukrainian](/wiki/Anti-Ukrainian_sentiment "Anti-Ukrainian sentiment")
).[\[350\]](#cite_note-354)
[\[351\]](#cite_note-355)
 In April 2019, he stated that he was not against a [Ukrainian language](/wiki/Ukrainian_language "Ukrainian language")
 quota ([on radio and TV](/wiki/Ukrainization#Mass_media "Ukrainization")
), although he noted they could be tweaked.[\[352\]](#cite_note-/7212672/_Zelensky-356)
 He also said that Russian artists "who have turned into (anti-Ukrainian) politicians" should remain banned from entering Ukraine.[\[339\]](#cite_note-3daysbUpeZi-343)

In response to a petition demanding equal rights for same-sex couples, Zelenskyy affirmed that democracies were measured by how they ensure equal rights for all citizens, that "all people are free and equal in their dignity and rights",[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
 and that the family "consists of persons who live together, are connected by common life, have mutual rights and obligations";[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 he asked the [Prime Minister of Ukraine](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Ukraine "Prime Minister of Ukraine")
 to review [civil partnerships](/wiki/Civil_union "Civil union")
 for same-sex couples and called this "part of the work on establishing and ensuring human rights and freedoms".[\[354\]](#cite_note-lgbtcnn-358)
 However, he said that [same-sex marriage](/wiki/Same-sex_marriage "Same-sex marriage")
 could not be introduced during wartime as this would require amending the Constitution of Ukraine, which defines marriage as "based on the free consent of a woman and a man", and the Constitution cannot be changed during martial law.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)
[\[355\]](#cite_note-359)
[\[356\]](#cite_note-blade-360)
 Civil rights organizations such as [Kyiv Pride](/wiki/Kyiv_Pride "Kyiv Pride")
 praised the statement,[\[356\]](#cite_note-blade-360)
 though [Holos](/wiki/Holos_(political_party) "Holos (political party)")
 MP [Inna Sovsun](/wiki/Inna_Sovsun "Inna Sovsun")
 criticised the lack of details about legal proposals for civil partnerships.[\[353\]](#cite_note-LGBTNYT-357)

On 2 December 2022, Zelenskyy said his administration would enter a bill in the Verkhovna Rada that would ban "religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation", referring to the [Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)](/wiki/Ukrainian_Orthodox_Church_(Moscow_Patriarchate) "Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)")
 (UOC-MP), from operating in Ukraine.[\[357\]](#cite_note-361)
 The bill was passed by parliament and signed by Zelenskyy in August 2024,[\[358\]](#cite_note-uocmp-362)
 after opposition parties protested the bill's delay.[\[359\]](#cite_note-uocmpdelay-363)
 The law treats each parish individually and gives it nine months to cut ties with the UOC-MP, following which a special commission will inspect individual parishes and file lawsuits against non-compliant ones; the court can then decide on a ban in each case.[\[360\]](#cite_note-uocmpexplain-364)

A White House official says US envoy Steve Witkoff's meeting with Vladimir Putin today went well, but Washington is still planning to impose secondary sanctions on Friday, Donald Trump's deadline for Vladimir Putin to end the war.

Secondary sanctions are designed to prevent third parties from trading with countries subject to sanctions.

Rubio says US to decide on Russia sanctions soon

The US secretary of state said he had spoken to special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is on his way back from a trip to Russia, and would have more discussions throughout the day. 

He told reporters there would hopefully be some announcements soon: "Maybe positive, maybe not." 

The Kremlin said Witkoff held "useful and constructive" talks with Vladimir Putin today, two days before the expiry of a deadline set by Donald Trump for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or face new sanctions.

India: US tariffs 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable'

Tariffs placed on India by the US over its imports of Russian oil are "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable", New Delhi's foreign ministry says.

Donald Trump earlier issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India over its continued imports of Russian (see 15.10 post).

The US president said he believed declining global energy prices could pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine.

In a statement, the Indian government labelled Trump's decision as "unfortunate", adding it will take "all actions necessary" to protect its national interests.

It says the country's imports are "based on market factors" and done with the objective of "ensuring the energy security of 1.4 billion people".

Ukraine war latest: Trump gives update on US-Putin talks - after doubling India tariffs in oil row
==================================================================================================

Donald Trump has hit India with new tariffs for buying Russian oil, while his envoy has held talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, two days before the US president's deadline for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war. Russia must end the war that it itself started. Thank you to everyone who stands with Ukraine."

'Russia isn't serious about Trump's deadline'

As we've mentioned, it appears the US will impose secondary sanctions on Russia on Friday - but is Moscow taking Washington seriously on its threats?

America's former ambassador to Ukraine says he's seen nothing from Trump in his seven months in office that would suggest he'd actually apply any serious sanctions on Moscow.

"The problem is that Trump set in the spring, maybe three times, deadlines of two weeks," Steven Pifer told [chief presenter Mark Austin](https://news.sky.com/author/mark-austin-983)
.

"Each time, the Russians did nothing to meet the deadline and Trump did nothing in terms of punitive measures against Moscow, so I'm not sure how serious they're treating this Friday deadline."

Pifer says that Vladimir Putin has consistently tried to portray himself as being prepared to engage with peace talks "without making any real compromise".

"I think what Putin is trying to do is string Trump along while he continues to let the Russian military do its thing against the Ukrainians on the ground."

Instead of placing tariffs on countries like India who still purchase Russian oil, Pifer says the best course of action to hurt Moscow would be to seize the nearly $300bn in frozen Russian assets and make those funds available for Ukraine. 

"That would signal to Putin that Ukraine will have the funding to continue this war for five, six, seven years."

President Donald Trump has traded barbs with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the US-Russia talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on February 19, 2025 \[Nathan Howard/Reuters\]

By Claire Cranford and Louis Jacobson | PolitiFact

Published On 20 Feb 202520 Feb 2025

As the third anniversary of [Russia’s Ukraine invasion](/news/2022/2/24/putin-orders-military-operations-in-eastern-ukraine-as-un-meets)
 nears, United States President Donald Trump has offered a false version of history.

US and Russian representatives held [talks in Saudi Arabia](/news/2025/2/19/us-russia-talks-five-takeaways-from-rubio-lavrov-meeting-on-ukraine-war)
 this week that included a discussion on how to end the war in Ukraine. You should have ended it three years – you should have never started it, you could have made a deal.”

This clashes with the evidence that Russia sent a large invasion force into Ukraine in February 2022.

The notion that Kyiv “started it” – that it is to blame for an invasion that has killed an estimated 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers and at least 12,000 civilians – led to outrage in Ukraine and from its allies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded that Trump “lives in this disinformation space”.

Trump’s deputy in his first term, Mike Pence, posted on February 19 on X, “Mr President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war. Zelenskyy has promised elections once martial law is lifted.

We asked the White House for evidence that Ukraine had started the war and received no response.

Russia’s attempt to blame Ukraine is part of a longstanding argument that does not stand up to scrutiny.

What happened in February 2022
------------------------------

As people were sleeping, Russian troops and tanks rolled into Ukraine and missiles poured down in what US military analysts called the [largest military operation](/news/2025/1/8/russia-gained-4000sq-km-of-ukraine-in-2024-how-many-soldiers-did-it-lose)
 in Europe since World War II. In Putin’s telling, “poor Russia was forced to rush to the persecuted Ukrainians’ defense and forestall NATO-inspired Ukrainian aggression”, Motyl said.

In 2023, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev echoed Putin’s stance, saying Ukraine is a part of Russia, but “we live in different apartments”.

Soon after the war started, more than 140 scholars signed a letter denouncing Putin’s narrative as “factually wrong, morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it, including Russian and Ukrainian soldiers of the Red Army”.

As for Trump’s recent remark, it is a “distillation of these Russian talking points”, Herron said.

Our ruling
----------

Trump said Zelenskyy “started” the war in Ukraine with Russia.

On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine, a country that the night before was at peace. Later, Trump dismissed complaints that Ukrainian officials were not invited to participate.

, answering reporters’ questions on February 18 at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Families packed belongings, swarmed ATMs and filling stations, and tried to flee the Russian invasion in cars, trains, planes and on foot.

How did the false talking point that Ukraine started the war begin?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To set the stage for the invasion, Putin had long denied Ukraine was even a country, falsely characterising its history and culture, arguing the Ukrainians were simply Russians who needed to be brought back into the fold.

PolitiFact recognised Putin’s lies justifying the Ukraine war as “our 2022 Lie of the Year”.

In 1990, Ukraine’s parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union, a call it repeated in August 1991. Since then, Putin has asserted that there is no such thing as a Ukrainian people separate from Russia.

“These claims were designed to deny the existence and agency of the Ukrainian nation,” Erik Herron, a West Virginia University political scientist and author of the book Elections and Democracy after Communism, told PolitiFact in 2022.

Yet, the history of Ukraine has involved several empires or states, some of which were entirely separate from Russia, Eugene Finkel, an associate professor with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told PolitiFact on the eve of the war.

Putin set the table for the 2022 invasion with a 5,000-word essay in July 2021. The Road to Peace must be built on the Truth.”

After Zelenskyy’s comments, Trump piled on [more attacks](/news/2025/2/19/dictator-trump-feuds-with-zelenskyy-amid-negotiations-over-ukraine-war)
 on Truth Social, claiming the Ukrainian president “is very low in Ukrainian Polls” and is “a Dictator without Elections”.

In a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology poll conducted between February 4 and 9, Zelenskyy had a 57 percent trust rating among Ukrainians surveyed. That is down from 90 percent in May 2022, shortly after Russia’s invasion, but up from 52 percent in December 2024. [Russian President Vladimir Putin](/news/2025/2/19/putin-rates-us-talks-highly-says-russia-ready-to-negotiate-over-ukraine)
 announced it as a “special military operation” at 6am Moscow time (03:00 GMT) on February 24, 2022.

“The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime,” Putin said in a televised address."

Content: "Putin responded by invading Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.

Second, the Biden administration has reacted to the outbreak of the war by doubling down against Russia. In response, Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in the Donbass between pro-Russian separatists and the Ukrainian government.

One often hears the argument that in the eight years between when the crisis broke out in February 2014 and when the war began in February 2022, the United States and its allies paid little attention to bringing Ukraine into NATO. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made the point succinctly at a press conference on January 14th, 2022, when he said, “the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not expand eastward.”

Nevertheless, the efforts of Lavrov and Putin to get the United States and its allies to abandon their efforts to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s border failed completely. The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine War
==============================================

_**! We live in perilous times.

Let me now lay out my argument in greater detail, starting with a description of the conventional wisdom about the causes of the conflict.

The Conventional Wisdom

It is widely and firmly believed in the West that Putin is solely responsible for causing the Ukraine crisis and certainly the ongoing war. In his July 12th, 2021, article about Russian-Ukrainian relations, which proponents of the conventional wisdom often point to as evidence of his imperial ambitions, he tells the Ukrainian people, “You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!” Regarding how Russia should treat Ukraine, he writes, “There is only one answer: with respect.” He concludes that lengthy article with the following words: “And what Ukraine will be—it is up to its citizens to decide.” It is hard to reconcile these statements with the claim that he wants to incorporate Ukraine within a greater Russia.

In that same July 12th, 2021 article and again in an important speech he gave on February 21st, 2022, Putin emphasized that Russia accepts “the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR.” He reiterated that same point for a third time on February 24th, 2022, when he announced that Russia would invade Ukraine. In short, Russia did not have the capability to subdue all of Ukraine, much less conquer other countries in Eastern Europe.

To take this argument a step further, Putin and other Russian leaders surely understand from the Cold War that occupying counties in the age of nationalism is invariably a prescription for never-ending trouble. Let me now turn to the real cause of the Ukraine crisis.

The Real Cause of the Crisis

The taproot of the crisis is the American-led effort to make Ukraine a Western bulwark on Russia’s borders. From his perspective, that would be a declaration of war.”

The Bush administration, which was pushing such a decision for NATO however, cared little about Moscow’s “brightest of red lines” and pressured the French and German leaders to agree to issuing a public pronouncement that said unequivocally that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join the alliance.

Unsurprisingly, the American-led effort to integrate Georgia into NATO resulted in a war between Georgia and Russia in August 2008—just four months after the Bucharest summit. He made a series of moves—like shutting down pro-Russian TV stations and arresting an especially close friend of Putin and charging him with treason—that were sure to anger Moscow.

President Biden, who moved into the White House in January 2021, had long been committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO and was also super-hawkish towards Russia."

. Control of [lithium](/wiki/Lithium "Lithium")
 deposits in the Donbas and Ukraine's grain wealth would give Russia a "monopoly on the world market".[\[77\]](#cite_note-DD-80)
 In 2022, Russian General Vladimir Ovchinsky confirmed that the "Russian special operation" aimed to seize Ukrainian lithium deposits.[\[24\]](#cite_note-DU-27)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-RA-81)

The US government estimates that Russia's economic losses from the war and Western sanctions will amount to around $1.3 trillion by 2025, and Russia's direct financial spending on the invasion is estimated at $250 billion (as of late 2024) – costs that Russia could not have foreseen."

Top Questions

### 

When did the Russia-Ukraine War begin?

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022, was the expansion of a war between the two countries that had begun in February 2014, when disguised Russian troops [covertly invaded and took control](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ukraine-crisis#ref323583)
 of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of [Crimea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crimea)
. British and European officials have also made estimates, while independent researchers and journalists have used open-source data to count losses.

### 

Why did Vladimir Putin invade Ukraine in 2022?

[Vladimir Putin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Putin)
’s invasion followed years of tension between [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia)
 and [Ukraine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ukraine)
 as Ukraine moved toward closer ties with the West, which Putin viewed as a threat to Russia’s influence. In March 2023 the International Criminal Court concluded that Russia’s mass kidnapping campaign constituted a war crime.

Russia’s [destruction of Kakhovka Dam](https://www.britannica.com/event/2022-Russian-invasion-of-Ukraine/The-Ukrainian-counterattack#ref374607)
 on the Dnipro River in June 2023 is also an example of how Russian forces have attacked Ukrainian infrastructure to inflict suffering on Ukraine’s population: some 240 square miles (620 square km) of territory were flooded, scores of people died, and dozens of towns were inundated, with up to 1 million people left without drinking water.

### 

How has the war in Ukraine impacted Russia’s military capabilities?

Russia’s visually confirmed losses as of early 2024 totaled more than 8,000 armored vehicles, including some 2,700 tanks. In recognition of Russia’s continued hybrid warfare campaign against Ukraine, the framework called for mediated talks between the two governments rather than any attempts at bilateral engagement.

Zelenskyy, as the President of Ukraine, was in a position of defense. He addressed the Russian people, pleading for peace, but vowing to defend Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim that Zelenskyy started the war is not supported by the evidence.

President Joe Biden has said the "irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies" about the government's hurricane response is "undermining confidence" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.

Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.

Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.

Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.

Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
------------------------------------------------------------------

At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.

“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants," Trump said in Michigan last week.

This claim is false.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.

Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.

This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.

So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.

Fema, which has now set up a [fact-checking page](https://www.fema.gov/disaster/current/hurricane-helene/rumor-response)
 on its website, called Trump's claim "false" saying, "no money is being diverted from disaster response needs".

In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted [from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fema_-_disaster_relief_fund_-_september_2019.pdf)
 - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.

But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.

[Political row erupts over Hurricane Helene disaster relief\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y3qgqxpwno)

Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
----------------------------------------

Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.

“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.

It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.

This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.

The $750 is what people can get as an [upfront payment](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery)
 to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.

Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.

This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.

So far, [Fema has said that more than $210m](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241007/federal-assistance-hurricane-helene-exceeds-210-million-fema-prepares-dual)
 has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.

! By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already [posted on X](https://x.com/ncnationalguard/status/1841976269941952920?s=46)
 that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.

The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.

The [North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website](https://www.ncdps.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/05/hurricane-helene-recovery-progresses-western-north-carolina)
 says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.

The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.

JD Vance criticised Fema's response to the hurricane at a rally in Butler on Saturday

Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
---------------------------------------

When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.

“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.

But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”

“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the [White House](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/white-house/)
 angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters.

"He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say [climate change](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/climate-change/)
 likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday.

"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, yes, yes, yes, yes," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if climate change was to blame for the trail of destruction left by the storm.

Drowned in their homes
----------------------

The sheriff's office in Pinellas County, Florida, published a grim litany of the nine lives lost there so far, almost all of whose bodies were found in their homes.

Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us.

Cooper, the North Carolina governor, said Monday that hundreds of roads had been destroyed and many communities were "wiped off the map."

"This is an unprecedented storm," he told reporters.  "The emotional and physical toll here is indescribable."

Cooper, a Democrat, also thanked Biden for providing federal personnel and resources.

Biden defends government response as Hurricane Helene death toll reaches 130
============================================================================

Americas

The death toll from a storm in the southeastern US reached 130 on Monday, sparking election campaign tensions. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.

"We're not talking about politics now," he said later, wearing a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat while standing in the rubble of a furniture store.

Democrat Harris, canceled campaign events to return to Washington Monday for a briefing on the federal response.

"Over the past few days, our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and devastation that we have seen in quite some time," Harris said following the briefing.

"And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 118 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding -- 49 in North Carolina, 25 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities compiled by AFP.

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc.

They also worked to restore [water](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/water/)
 and power supply to the affected areas, remove fallen trees, deliver supplies and register people for disaster assistance.

The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

Biden accused of 'sleeping' 
----------------------------

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction -- and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks' time.

In the city of Valdosta, Georgia, Trump vowed to "bring lots of relief material, including fuel, equipment, water, and other things" to those in need.

"The federal government is not being responsive," he told reporters."

Content: "In a brief exchange with reporters, he described the impact of the storm as “stunning” and said that the administration is giving states “everything we have” to help with their response to the storm.

Biden planned to speak about the administration’s response efforts in remarks from the White House on Monday.

The White House also said Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the storm-ravaged areas “as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.” At a Las Vegas rally Sunday night, Harris spoke about the impact of Helene, saying, “I know everyone here sends their thoughts and prayer for the folks who have been so devastated by that hurricane.”

She added: “We will stand with these communities for as long as it takes and make sure they are able to rebuild.”

Harris was spending Sunday night in Las Vegas and had planned campaign stops in the city on Monday. Harris received similar briefings while on board Air Force Two, according to the White House.

The White House said Biden directed Criswell to figure out what can be done to accelerate support to isolated communities that are having difficulty accessing assistance.

Trump is expected to receive a briefing, facilitate the distribution of relief supplies and deliver remarks during the visit, according to his campaign.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that on September 29, 2024, President Biden commented on Hurricane Helene and planned to visit affected areas. However, the provided sources do not mention any announcements regarding the cessation of aid for hurricane-affected areas or the allocation of funds to Ukraine.

The claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm whether President Biden made the specific announcements described in the claim.

The death toll from a devastating storm that battered the southeastern United States climbed to at least 130 on Monday, September 30, as the disaster became a hot topic in an already bitter election campaign, with the White House angrily refuting claims it had been slow to respond.

With hundreds still missing across several southeastern US states and the death toll climbing, President Joe Biden announced he would travel to storm-ravaged North Carolina Wednesday to monitor rescue efforts.

Biden also accused former president Donald Trump of spreading lies, after the Republican presidential candidate charged, without evidence, that the federal government was ignoring the disaster brought on by Hurricane Helene and denying help to his supporters. that's simply not true, and it's irresponsible."

At least 130 people were killed by the storm and associated flooding: 57 in North Carolina, 29 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 14 in Florida, four in Tennessee and one in Virginia, according to tallies from local authorities and media reports compiled by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Widespread havoc
----------------

Emergency workers continued a grim search for hundreds of people still unaccounted for across the affected states, where torrential rains brought widespread havoc. A president's role is usually to oversee and coordinate aid, including funding.

Scientists say climate change likely plays a role in the rapid intensification of hurricanes, because there is more energy in warmer oceans for them to feed on, and Biden stressed as much Monday. "And we have responded with our best, with the best folks who are on the ground and here doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis."

Responding to Trump's criticism that he was "sleeping" instead of dealing with the storm damage, Biden defended his decision to spend the weekend at his home in Delaware, saying he was working "the whole time."

When a major natural disaster hits the United States, the federal government responds at the request of states. Nearly all appeared to have drowned, it said, describing some found still lying in several inches of water, while others were buried under debris.

In Georgia, residents faced power cuts, supply shortages, blocked roads and broken communication lines in often mountainous terrain, with Governor Brian Kemp describing the storm as a "250-mile wide tornado."

Close to two million households and businesses remained without power on Monday, according to tracker poweroutage.us. "He's lying," Biden told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that he had spoken to North Carolina governor Ray Cooper "and he told him he's lying. The death toll was expected to rise, authorities warned, with cell phone service knocked out across much of the region and up to 600 people still missing.

With Biden preparing to head to North Carolina, Trump on Monday arrived in Georgia, another epicenter of the destruction – and both are among the key swing states where the US election will be decided in just five weeks. "The vice president, she's out someplace, campaigning, looking for money," he said, referring to his election rival, Vice President Kamala Harris."

The fact-check reveals that on September 29, 2024, President Biden discussed Hurricane Helene and pledged aid to the victims. This contradicts the claim that he announced the cessation of aid for the affected areas. Furthermore, the search results do not mention any allocation of funds to Ukraine.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is contradicted by the available evidence. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. Evidence from Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/united-states/article/2024/09/30/biden-pledges-to-aid-victims-of-hurrican-helene-as-long-as-it-takes_6727795_133.html)) indicates that Biden pledged aid to Hurricane Helene victims, contradicting the claim of aid cessation. The search results also do not support the claim of additional aid to Ukraine.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/olaf-scholz-germany-donald-trump-war-in-ukraine-peace-plan/): 
Content: "President Donald Trump appears not to have told Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his impending bombshell peace plan for Ukraine, despite Germany’s crucial role in supplying arms and aid to Kyiv.

Scholz spoke to POLITICO on Wednesday, only hours before the Trump administration’s shock announcement that it would conduct peace negotiations over the head of European leaders, effectively ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia and insisting that Europe should provide the lion’s share of military and financial aid.

In his conversation with Berlin Playbook, Scholz said he had been receiving indications from Trump and his advisers that Washington would not perform such a dramatic U-turn on support for Kyiv.

“The talks that I have had with \[Trump\] and that my advisers have also had with his advisers lead to the conclusion that we can hope and assume that the U.S. troops involved in any peacekeeping operation.

The German chancellery has not yet responded to a request for comment relating to the latest developments.

On the question of whether Germany would send troops as part of a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, Scholz suggested there would be no solution without U.S. is involved, because transatlantic unity must always be guaranteed,” Scholz said when asked whether Gemany would send troops as part of any potential peacekeeping operation.

The fact that the chancellor of the EU’s biggest economy appeared to be unaware of Washington’s plans suggests Scholz’s expectation for transatlantic unity was misguided.

Germany is second only to the U.S. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.

In Munich, Vance is also [scheduled](https://www.politico.eu/article/jd-vance-and-germanys-likely-next-chancellor-set-to-talk-ukraine-trade/)
 to meet Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, in what will be the first high-level meeting between a member of Trump’s second administration and the German conservatives — who are in pole position to lead the country’s next government after the Feb. 23 parliamentary election.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, meanwhile, criticized Trump’s stance on negotiations with Moscow, lamenting that his administration had “made public concessions to Putin before talks even began.”

“In my view, it would have been better to discuss issues like Ukraine’s potential NATO membership or territorial losses at the negotiating table — not beforehand,” the politician from Scholz’s center-left Social Democratic Party said ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.

Misleading claims targeting the German chancellor have been spreading online days before German voters head to the polls to elect a new government.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has not ordered a state of emergency in Germany over the US’s bilateral peace negotiations with Russia, despite the claim spreading widely across social platforms.

Users on X, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok falsely accused Scholz of urging parliament to impose a state of emergency — known as "Notstand" in German — that would severely curtail citizens’ rights.

But a closer look at Scholz’s speech reveals he was referring to "Notlage", an entirely different concept in the German Basic Law that refers to an urgent situation, but which is not synonymous with a government-imposed state of emergency.

Speaking over the weekend as the Trump administration geared for talks with Russian officials in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, Scholz said: “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.”

The article referenced by Scholz states that natural disasters or “exceptional emergency situations” can justify changes to the country’s so-called debt brake, allowing the government to borrow beyond the credit limit.

**What is the debt brake and how could it be used to finance defence spending?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Germany has strict limits on government borrowing, known as a debt brake. It’s aimed at restricting the budget deficit to less than 0.35% of the country’s annual gross domestic product (GDP).

The debt brake became legally binding for the government in 2016 and for the federal states in 2020.

In recent months, both Scholz’ Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens have advocated for suspending the debt brake in response to the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis.

Scholz’s other coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), fiercely opposed the move, contributing to a breakdown in trust that collapsed the three-way coalition government last November.

Scholz has said he expects the next government, which will be elected on Sunday, to trigger this article to ramp up its spending on defence and security.

The Christian Democrats’ Friedrich Merz, who is tipped to become the next German chancellor, has also expressed [**openness**](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/10/chancellor-hopeful-merz-open-to-reform-of-germanys-debt-brake)
 to loosening the debt brake once other options have been exhausted.

This is despite a broad camp of his CDU party opposing any changes to Germany's strict borrowing limits.

**Misleading claims spread days before crunch vote**
----------------------------------------------------

The misleading claims targeting Scholz come days before German voters head to the ballot boxes to elect a new government.

The Conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) are poised to emerge as the biggest party and form a government, but could be forced to rely on the support of Scholz's Social Democratic Party to do so.

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is currently polling in second place.

There is concern that coordinated misinformation campaigns, including those engineered by the Kremlin, could put the integrity of the vote at risk.

A German non-profit has detected Russia's well-known "Doppelgänger" campaign resurfacing, cloning the websites of renowned media outlets by purchasing similar-looking domains to spread falsified news articles.

The European Commission has attempted to minimise risks by engaging with social media platforms, including in a roundtable in Berlin and a recent [**stress test**](https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/24/online-platforms-participate-in-stress-test-ahead-of-german-election)
 of their of their risk mitigation measures.

Scholz rejects ‘dictated peace’ for Ukraine as Europe reels after Trump-Putin call
==================================================================================

Europe

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday said a deal to end the Ukraine war should not be imposed on Kyiv as European leaders warned of security implications on the continent after US President Donald Trump agreed to open negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call.

European leaders scrambled on Thursday to try to get a seat at the table in [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 peace talks after US President [Donald Trump](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/)
 announced the start of negotiations after speaking directly to Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vladimir-putin/)
 in a phone call.

Trump’s move sent shockwaves through European capitals, which want a central role in peace talks because any settlement in Ukraine, hit by a full-scale Russian invasion three years ago, will have ramifications for their own security.

German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/olaf-scholz/)
 warned that the Ukraine conflict must not end with an “dictated peace”.

"The next task is to ensure that there is no dictated peace," Scholz said in an interview with Politico.

[NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 Secretary General [Mark Rutte](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mark-rutte/)
 stressed that [Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/)
 must be involved in peace talks and any final deal to end Moscow's war on Kyiv needs to be "enduring".

"Of course, this is crucial – (when) we talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine is closely involved in everything happening about Ukraine," Rutte told journalists ahead of a [NATO](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/nato/)
 meeting defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday.

'Crucial moment of truth'
-------------------------

French Defence Minister [Sébastien Lecornu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/sébastien-lecornu/)
 on Thursday warned that NATO faces a moment of reckoning as the US and Russia set in motion negotiations to end the Ukraine war.

"It's a crucial moment of truth," said Lecornu. Peace, this has unfortunately been the experience over centuries, can only be secured from a position of strength," he added.

Their comments came the morning after Trump took the world by surprise when he announced that the US and Russia had agreed to "have our respective teams start negotiations immediately" on Ukraine during a phone conversation between Trump and Putin.

Following Trump's revelations, the foreign ministers of [France](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/)
, Germany and Spain insisted that any peace deal in Ukraine could not be achieved without the involvement of Kyiv and its European partners.

"There will be no just and lasting peace in Ukraine without the participation of Europeans," French Foreign Minister [Jean-Noël Barrot](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jean-noël-barrot/)
 told a foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, while his German and Spanish counterparts added that no decisions could be taken without Ukraine.

Trump's peace push 'not a betrayal', says Hegseth
-------------------------------------------------

US defence chief Pete Hegseth however told reporters on Thursday that Trump's peace plan was "not a betrayal" of Ukraine.

"There is no betrayal there. That's historically true – but the question is, will it still be true 10 or 15 years from now."

His German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, said it was "regrettable" that the Trump's administration had made "concessions" to Russia before peace talks on Ukraine had even started. 

"In my view it would have been better to speak about a possible NATO membership for Ukraine or possible losses of territory at the negotiating table," Pistorius said ahead of the NATO meeting. 

Russia would be remain a threat to Europe's security even if an agreement for peace in Ukraine can be reached, Pistorius added.

"It would be naive to believe that this threat, even after any peace agreement whenever it materialises, would in fact subside," he said.

"That's why we have to invest faster and more in our defence and security capabilities. And so that will require both sides recognising things they don't want to," said Hegseth.

Speaking to reporters in Brussels before the start of Thursday's NATO meeting, Hegseth said it was Europe's responsibility to stop the Russian "war machine".

Hegseth repeated his call for increased defence spending by NATO countries, which he said should ultimately reach 5% of gross domestic product.

The US defence chief told European counterparts on Wednesday that Ukraine's dream of returning to its pre-2014 borders was an "illusionary goal" – and that Kyiv's wish for NATO membership was "not realistic".

Swedish Defence Minister Pal Jonson on Thursday said Ukraine could still become a NATO member in the future if it fulfils all conditions to join the military alliance.

"I don't foresee the NATO membership as such being off the table for Ukraine," Jonson said before attending the NATO meeting.

'Peace in Europe is at stake'
-----------------------------

German Foreign Minister [Annalena Baerbock](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/annalena-baerbock/)
 on Thursday reiterated the message that Ukraine and Europe need to be involved in [peace talks](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/peace-talks/)
 about Ukraine.

"We can't have talks without involving Ukraine. This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality," said Baerbock, a member of the Greens party.

UK Defence Secretary John Healey echoed Baerbock's comments, insisting that Ukraine and Europe should participate in negotiations with Russia to bring an end to the conflict.

“Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” said Healey."

Here are three highlights from their conversation:

_1) Trump has broken with both the Biden administration and European allies with his policy toward Ukraine_. vote, arguing that “Trump has decided to throw Ukraine under the bus in an effort to end the war without a plan.” While Europe has insisted on Russian concessions as part of any peace deal, Trump has sought to build leverage over Ukraine instead. “They need to get serious.” The good news is that European states are increasing their defense spending, and some leaders have proposed sending peacekeepers to enforce a ceasefire in Ukraine_._ Nevertheless, with Trump looking to move quickly, Europe may be left holding onto substantial security commitments without the capabilities ready to defend them.

Trump says US will 'pass' on Ukraine peace talks if no progress soon

Watch: Trump says US will 'take a pass' if no progress in Ukraine talks

Donald Trump has said the US will "take a pass" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv "make it very difficult" to reach a peace deal.

The US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he was not expecting a truce to happen in "a specific number of days" but he wanted it done "quickly".

His comments came hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US would abandon talks unless there were clear signs of progress within days.

"We're not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end," Rubio said, adding that the US had "other priorities to focus on".

This comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue, with two people reported killed and more than 100 injured in the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Sumy on Friday.

Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Russian troops have been advancing - albeit slowly - in eastern Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire.

Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin and sharp criticism of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky have raised concern among Nato allies, who argue that support for Kyiv must be maintained.

When asked about a deal between Russia and Ukraine on Friday, Trump said: "We're talking about here people dying. But we have a deal on that".

Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP and the chair of Ukraine's parliamentary committee on EU Integration, told the BBC the Ukrainian parliament would have "the last word" in the deal.

She added: "I hope that there will be enough reasoning to ensure that whatever is signed, and if it is going to be ratified that it is in the interest of our country and our people".

On Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris to discuss how to end the war.

Sybiha said they had "discussed the paths to a fair and lasting peace, including full ceasefire, multinational contingent, and [security guarantees](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93g12g38n4o)
 for Ukraine".

"Now if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, 'you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're going to just take a pass."

Despite the Trump administration's initial confidence that it could secure a deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides.

Following a meeting with European leaders in Paris about a potential ceasefire on Thursday, Rubio told reporters on Friday: "We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable."

"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on," he said about truce talks.

He admitted that a peace deal would be difficult to strike.

Trump had said before he re-entered office that he would stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.

"It's not our war": US Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatens to move on from Ukraine peace talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked to respond to Trump saying he expected an answer from Russia on a ceasefire, said "the negotiations taking place are quite difficult".

"The Russian side is striving to reach a peace settlement in this conflict, to ensure its own interests, and is open to dialogue," he said.

During a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance said he was still "optimistic" about ending the Ukraine war.

"I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours," he said.

"I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war - this very brutal war - to a close."

Vance's comments followed separate news that Ukraine and the US took the first step towards striking a minerals deal, after an initial agreement was derailed when a February meeting between Trump and President Zelensky erupted into a public shouting match.

On Thursday, the two countries signed a memorandum of intent on setting up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as part of an economic partnership agreement.

The aim is to finalise the deal by 26 April, the memo published by the Ukrainian government says.

The details of any deal remain unclear. Previous leaks have suggested the agreement has been extended beyond minerals to control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as well as its oil and gas.

Ukrainian negotiators have tried to resist Trump's demands that a joint investment fund would pay back the US for previous military aid, but have seemingly accepted his claim that it would help the country recover after the war ends.

The memo said the "American people desire to invest alongside the Ukrainian people in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine".

Zelensky had been hoping to use the deal to secure a US security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire deal, telling European leaders last month that "a ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine".

The US has so far resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees.

The White House argues the mere presence of US businesses would put off Russia from further aggression, but that did not exactly work when they invaded in 2022.

, with pictures of Svyrydenko and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately signing the document over an online call.

"There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries," Svyrydenko wrote.

Bessent said the details were still being worked out but the deal is "substantially what we'd agreed on previously."

Trump hinted at the deal during a press conference with Meloni, saying "we have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on (next) Thursday..."

# Search Result
From [Source](https://city-countyobserver.com/a-tale-of-two-wealthy-senators/): 
Content: "Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer of New York are prominent examples, each reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars despite earning approximately $200,000 annually in their federal roles. This inheritance was a key factor in a significant jump in McConnell’s reported net worth.

In addition to his marriage, McConnell has been a savvy political operator. For instance, McConnell’s alignment with corporate interests has ensured steady campaign contributions, bolstering his influence and indirectly enhancing his financial security.

#### **Chuck Schumer: Real Estate Deals and Financial Savvy**

Senator Chuck Schumer, representing New York since 1998, has also achieved remarkable financial success, with recent estimates suggesting his net worth surpasses $60 million. **Spousal Wealth and Inheritance**: Marriages to affluent individuals or inheritances significantly boost the net worth of some politicians, as seen with McConnell.
3. Senegal (sneaky but legal) was intrigued and here is the result.

#### **Mitch McConnell: Wealth Through Marriage and Political Longevity**

Senator Mitch McConnell has long been a fixture in American politics, representing Kentucky since 1985 and serving as Senate Majority Leader for several years. His reported net worth exceeds $30 million, a figure that belies his relatively modest government salary. New York’s status as a financial hub has further enabled him to cultivate relationships with high-net-worth individuals and corporations. **Campaign Fundraising and Financial Management**: While campaign funds are strictly regulated, the infrastructure and networks built for fundraising often have ancillary financial benefits for politicians.

The wealth of Senators McConnell and Schumer illustrates how political careers, coupled with advantageous circumstances, can lead to substantial financial gains. Unlike McConnell, Schumer’s wealth stems less from family ties and more from strategic investments, particularly in real estate.

Schumer reportedly acquired several properties early in his career, often benefiting from favorable terms. While such practices are not necessarily illegal, they highlight how political influence can open doors to lucrative opportunities.

Additionally, Schumer’s position as Senate Majority Leader has amplified his access to influential networks."

Misinformation is often spread regarding Russia's war in Ukraine to sway public opinion about support for Kyiv and put pressure on western governments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](https://static.euronews.com/website/images/logos/logo-euronews-stacked-outlined-72x72-grey-9.svg) ADVERTISEMENT

An image doing the rounds on social media allegedly shows a list of US politicians, including President Joe Biden, who have received bribes in return for support for Ukraine.

Text accompanying the list claims that a Ukrainian official released the names, as well as the amounts that each person has supposedly received.

Biden has allegedly received $92 million (€89.6 million), for example, while former speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has taken home $86 million, and former senator Mitt Romney has received $71 million, according to the list.

The image, posted on the likes of Threads and X, shows a range of politicians across the US political divide.

Regardless, the claims are false — there's no evidence that any of the individuals mentioned have received any illicit payments from Ukraine in return for their pushing of support for Kyiv against the Russian invasion.

There are no legitimate news outlets reporting on the news, and it's also implausible that a Ukrainian official would release the statistics and incriminate the very politicians the country is relying on for financial aid.

The text accompanying the list tends to be badly written — another hallmark of untrustworthy news, especially as the mistakes are often the same, suggesting they're copied, pasted, and shared en masse.

Searching for earlier instances of the claims on X shows that it originates from at least as far back as 2023, and has been shared on various occasions since then.

Other fact-checkers from reputable news organisations debunked the claims at those times as well, and there's no reason to believe that the situation has changed since then.

Pro-Russian propaganda and other Ukraine detractors are often keen to spread false or misleading claims about support for Kyiv to sway public opinion and in turn, put pressure on western governments.

As of 30 September 2024, the US's Ukraine response funding totals nearly $183 billion since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, according to official Ukraine Oversight figures.

In Europe, as of January, the EU says it has made available more than $140 billion in financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance through its collective and individual member-state measures in the same period.

Washington is Ukraine's single biggest donor, yet as Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, European allies are concerned that the US could reduce or even stop providing aid altogether due to the president-elect's previous criticism of the amount the US sends.

The outgoing Biden administration is giving Ukraine as much military support as it can, including a $500 million weapons package aimed at putting Kyiv in the strongest possible position for potential negotiations to end the war. 

The defence ministers of Europe's five biggest military spenders — France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK — met near Warsaw on Monday to discuss maintaining support for Ukraine and enhancing domestic weapons production ahead of any shifts in US policy.

**A top Senate Republican has released an FBI document detailing an allegation President Joe Biden and his son accepted bribes from a Ukrainian firm.**

Chuck Grassley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: "The American people can now read this document for themselves."

The unclassified memo is a June 2020 internal FBI report outlining claims by a foreign informant.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden received any payments from Ukraine.

Senior congressional Republicans have acknowledged the allegation is unverified.

The memo contains a claim that Hunter Biden was hired by the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, in 2013 as a way to gain support from his father, who was the US vice-president at the time.

*   [Hunter Biden: Who are the IRS tax whistleblowers?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66252781)
    
*   [The struggles and scandals of Hunter Biden](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55805698)
    
*   [What was Hunter Biden doing in China and Ukraine?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-54553132)
    

It also alleges that Burisma made two $5m (£3.9m) payments to "the Bidens" as part of its efforts to remove Ukraine's prosecutor general at the time, Viktor Shokin - and that there were audio recordings of both Hunter and Joe Biden that supported this.

The informant told the FBI he had learned these details during conversations he had with the Burisma chief executive and other company officials in 2015 or 2016.

! He said voters could now make their own minds up "without the filter of politicians or bureaucrats".

Its public release, however, is a highly unusual move and could further inflame tensions between congressional Republicans and the FBI and Biden administration officials.

Since regaining a majority last year in the House of Representatives after four years of Democratic control, Republicans have launched a range of investigations into President Biden and his family.

The allegations detailed in the FBI document are similar to ones aired over the past several years by Mr Biden's political opponents, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had repeatedly travelled to Ukraine to conduct his own personal investigations.

Mr Giuliani's accusations against the Bidens became a focus of Mr Trump's first impeachment trial in 2019, which centred on the then-president's efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce he was launching an investigation into Joe Biden's supposed ties to Burisma.

Chuck Grassley said releasing the FBI document was in the public interest

Vice-President Biden had publicly pressed for Mr Shokin's removal as part of a larger effort by the Obama administration and US allies due to concerns that he was ineffective in tackling corruption in Ukraine.

Mr Grassley, an Iowa senator, says he obtained a lightly redacted copy of the memo from a justice department "whistleblower" and decided releasing it was in the public interest.

He and other Republicans have said the FBI considers the informant to be highly credible, but the report details how the informant said he could not vouch for the accuracy of the information he was passing along.

 on Thursday. <image:8766>!Getty Images Bill Barr <image:8771>Getty Images

Bill Barr led the corruption inquiry in 2020

Bill Barr, the attorney general under Mr Trump, opened a justice department inquiry into the allegations in 2020.

[He told the Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2023/06/07/exclusive-bill-barr-confirms-rep-jamie-raskin-lied-about-biden-family-corruption-investigation/)
 last month that he passed the case on to the US attorney in Joe Biden's home state of Delaware.

No charges were ever filed in the case.

White House spokesman Ian Sams said: "It is remarkable that congressional Republicans, in their eagerness to go after President Biden regardless of the truth, continue to push claims that have been debunked for years.

"It's clear that congressional Republicans are dead-set on playing shameless, dishonest politics and refuse to let truth get in the way."

Congressional Republicans learned of the existence of the FBI document detailing the informant's account earlier this year.

They had pressed FBI Director Chris Wray to provide it to the House Oversight Committee - going so far as to threaten to hold him in contempt of Congress if he refused to comply.

He eventually provided members of the committee with the opportunity to privately access a redacted version, but warned that a public release would jeopardise FBI intelligence-gathering methods.

"We have repeatedly explained to Congress, in correspondence and in briefings, how critical it is to keep this source information confidential," the FBI said in a statement.

"Today's release of the 1023 - at a minimum - unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source."

After a private review of the document last month, Jamie Raskin, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said it contained only unfounded, second-hand accusations and no new details.

The FBI officials have described FD-1023 forms as a means to document "raw, unverified" intelligence information that does not reflect the conclusions of investigators.

"Recording this information does not validate it, establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI in our investigations," the agency said in a recent statement.

Even Senator Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who with Mr Grassley wrote a Senate report on Hunter Biden, has sounded sceptical about the memo.

[According to the Cedar Rapids Gazette](https://www.thegazette.com/government-politics/iowas-chuck-grassley-releases-fbi-memo-with-unverified-claims-alleging-biden-bribery-scheme/)
, he told a conservative radio show host Vicki McKenna last month: "This could be coming from a very corrupt oligarch who could be making this stuff up."

 This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption.[\[20\]](#cite_note-20)
[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

After the start of the [Russo-Ukrainian War](/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War "Russo-Ukrainian War")

 Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign,[\[27\]](#cite_note-27)
 and media in the United States.[\[28\]](#cite_note-28)
[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)

The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son,[\[26\]](#cite_note-Bastos-2019-26)
 and that he did it in a _[quid pro quo](/wiki/Quid_pro_quo "Quid pro quo")
_ manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. \[The informant\] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired.[\[4\]](#cite_note-Prokop_9/28/2023-4)

Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems."[\[35\]](#cite_note-Whitehurst_Mascaro_2/15/2024-35)

The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled [House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family](/wiki/United_States_House_Oversight_Committee_investigation_into_the_Biden_family "United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family")
 in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. and Israeli citizen who should be detained pending trial; the presiding magistrate judge ordered him released provided he surrender his passports and wear a GPS monitor.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

Conspirators
------------

The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament,[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)
 right-wing media supportive of Trump,[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 and members of the Trump campaign, such as [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 and [Steve Bannon](/wiki/Steve_Bannon "Steve Bannon")
.[\[43\]](#cite_note-43)

### Russian involvement

Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian [GRU](/wiki/GRU_(Russian_Federation) "GRU (Russian Federation)")
 lieutenant general [Vladimir Alekseyevin](/wiki/Vladimir_Alekseyev_(general) "Vladimir Alekseyev (general)")
, his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov.[\[44\]](#cite_note-44)
 They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers [Oleksandr Dubinsky](/wiki/Oleksandr_Dubinsky "Oleksandr Dubinsky")
 and [Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
, Prosecutor [Kostiantyn Kulyk](/wiki/Kostiantyn_Kulyk "Kostiantyn Kulyk")
 and businessmen [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash")
 and [Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 The three were given ten million dollars[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)
 and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
 Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine.[\[45\]](#cite_note-Stern-2023-45)

Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 He also met with [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani")
 in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)

In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube")
 channel shutdown. 2020 presidential elections.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Meduza-48)

#### Andrii Derkach

[Andrii Derkach](/wiki/Andrii_Derkach "Andrii Derkach")
 is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Kessler-2020-5)
 The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited,[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)
 In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake.[\[54\]](#cite_note-Bertrand-2020-54)
[\[55\]](#cite_note-55)
 In September 2020, the [United States Department of the Treasury](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury "United States Department of the Treasury")
 sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy.[\[58\]](#cite_note-facing_scrutiny-58)

Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges.[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)
 Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc.com-47)
 and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities.[\[60\]](#cite_note-60)

#### Dmytro Firtash

 was a middleman for [Gazprom](/wiki/Gazprom "Gazprom")
 and connected to the Ukrainian government.[\[61\]](#cite_note-61)

 boss [Semion Mogilevich](/wiki/Semion_Mogilevich "Semion Mogilevich")
.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General [William Barr](/wiki/William_Barr "William Barr")
 to drop charges against Firtash but failed.[\[62\]](#cite_note-NBC_News-2020-62)

#### Konstantin Kilimnik

[Konstantin Kilimnik](/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik "Konstantin Kilimnik")
 oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian [Federal Security Service](/wiki/Federal_Security_Service "Federal Security Service")
 (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections.[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by [President Putin](/wiki/President_Putin "President Putin")

 He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump.[\[66\]](#cite_note-66)
[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)

### American media involvement

American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)
 Specifically [Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")
,[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

 and [One America News Network](/wiki/One_America_News_Network "One America News Network")
[\[70\]](#cite_note-oan_atlantic-70)
 were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory.

#### Peter Schweizer

[Peter Schweizer](/wiki/Peter_Schweizer "Peter Schweizer")

 The plagiarized book[\[71\]](#cite_note-71)
 included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch.[\[25\]](#cite_note-Mayer-2019-25)

Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets.[\[72\]](#cite_note-72)
 This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine[\[73\]](#cite_note-73)
 and Congress to promote the lie.[\[74\]](#cite_note-74)

#### John Solomon

_ attributes [John Solomon](/wiki/John_Solomon_(political_commentator) "John Solomon (political commentator)")
, formerly of _[The Hill](/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper) "The Hill (newspaper)")
_, the most responsibility[\[75\]](#cite_note-Farhi-2019-75)
 for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. An internal review by the Hill found "serious doubts about the credibility of Solomon’s Ukrainian sources".[\[77\]](#cite_note-77)

Biden approves nuclear strategy refocusing on China threat – report
===================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

White House says plan was approved earlier this year and was not a response to a single country or threat

[Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)
 has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/us/politics/biden-nuclear-china-russia.html)
 on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat.

The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while “the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.”

Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a “no first use” policy, as so far only China and India have done.

On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence.

In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, [warned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/17/row-as-nato-chief-hints-at-talks-to-increase-availability-of-nuclear-weapons)
 that “absent a change” in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal.

Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised “the need to deter Russia, the PRC \[People’s Republic of China\] and [North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea)
 simultaneously”.

The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, [New Start](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty)
, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place.

China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, meeting at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022. The Russian president, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin)
, has [threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/21/russia-begins-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drills-near-ukraine-border)
 to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

China’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was “seriously concerned” by the reports and accused the US of “stirring up the so-called ‘China nuclear threat theory’”. But China’s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country’s.

The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration’s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia)
 and toward China.

Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy”.

Biden approved the revised strategy – called the nuclear employment guidance – in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress.

After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia’s nuclear strategies more recently. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea.

The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had “issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries” and for “the significant increase in the size and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal.

“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” the Times quoted Narang as saying. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”

The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of [China’s nuclear arsenal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/20/china-expanding-nuclear-arsenal-much-faster-than-predicted-us-report-says)

 allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space.

On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, [published a piece](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/20/nuclear-weapons-war-no-first-use-policy/)
 in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy."

What Biden has done on nuclear policy while in office
-----------------------------------------------------

Biden’s most important nuclear achievement has been successfully deterring Russian nuclear escalation over the war in Ukraine: Russia has not used nuclear weapons against NATO members or against Ukraine itself. Indeed, the treaty is still standing only because Biden quickly negotiated an [extension](https://www.state.gov/on-the-extension-of-the-new-start-treaty-with-the-russian-federation/)
 during his first weeks in office, and the administration has expressed [continued](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-12/news/bidens-nuclear-posture-straddles-obama-trump-policies)
 interest in strategic arms control if it can find a willing partner in Moscow.

The Biden administration has also worked to stabilize relations with China, a country whose nuclear arsenal is undergoing a rapid [expansion](https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/19/2003323409/-1/-1/1/2023-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)
. These differences matter because of the enormous presidential latitude with respect to nuclear decision-making, including presidents’ [sole authority](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf)
 to launch nuclear weapons without authorization from other parts of the government.

While in office, Trump was often confrontational in his dealings with other nuclear powers and was openly skeptical of the alliance relationships that depend on U.S. While valuing a robust deterrent, Biden also has a long-standing commitment to arms control.

What Trump did on nuclear policy while in office
------------------------------------------------

Trump’s [decision](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/)
 to renege on the Iran nuclear deal—despite the [State Department](https://2017-2021.state.gov/briefings/department-press-briefing-july-18-2017/)
 certifying that Iran was complying with its terms—was likely the most significant nuclear policy decision of his time in office. In fact, North Korea significantly expanded and improved its nuclear arsenal on Trump’s watch, gaining the [ability](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missile-south-korea-says-2023-12-17/)
 to hit the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.

Furthermore, Trump actively stoked a dangerous nuclear crisis with North Korea in the period leading up to the summit. At another point, he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E948355557022420992%7Ctwgr%5E8f3c7c895f959526a3e4adcaae7b41e23ea14eba%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2Fpolitics%2Fdonald-trump-north-korea-nuclear%2Findex.html)
 of Kim, “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump was later [revealed](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120)
 to have privately considered using a nuclear weapon against North Korea while falsely blaming it on another country.

Finally, the Trump administration was highly skeptical of arms control with other nuclear powers. China’s nuclear arsenal is expanding as it becomes increasingly [confrontational](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-starts-military-drills-around-taiwan-days-after-new-president-takes-office-2024-05-23/#:~:text=China%20launched%20military%20drills%20around,of%20high%2Dvalue%20military%20targets.)
 toward Taiwan. This is in significant part because Biden has effectively [communicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html)
 that the United States will defend NATO, and also that it would respond forcefully (though almost certainly [not](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/will-biden-putin-goes-nuclear-experts-say-nuclear-response-unlikely-no-rcna32756)
 with nuclear weapons) to Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. For example, it has ([mostly](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/24/us-long-range-missiles-ukraine-00154110)
) constrained Ukraine’s ability to conduct longer-range attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has taken steps to stabilize the overall strategic nuclear relationship with Russia. It has also fortified the defense relationship with South Korea through the [Washington Declaration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/26/washington-declaration-2/)
, which will engage the two countries more closely on nuclear deterrence matters.

What Biden might do on nuclear policy if reelected
--------------------------------------------------

As with Trump, Biden’s first term in office provides useful guidance as to his likely nuclear policy priorities were he to be reelected."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President [Joe Biden](https://apnews.com/hub/joe-biden)
 has approved a new national security memorandum ahead of [Donald Trump’s return](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
 to the White House that could serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to counter [growing cooperation](https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-russia-trade-flights-tourism-ukraine-a6dd64440b4d451026c0bb32d5235a91)
 among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House said Wednesday.

Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. The officials added that Russia has “de facto accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapon state.”

China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two countries working together to deepen their military technical cooperation. China, meanwhile, has supported Russia with [dual use components](https://apnews.com/article/united-states-china-russia-ukraine-war-265df843be030b7183c95b6f3afca8ec)
