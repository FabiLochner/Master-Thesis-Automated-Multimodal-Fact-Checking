## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://en.isna.ir/news/1403060502566/F-16s-may-have-been-hit-in-Russian-strike-on-hangar-in-Ivano-Frankovsk): 
Content: The search result from ISNA contains an image of a destroyed aircraft inside a hangar. The article suggests that F-16s may have been hit in a Russian strike on a hangar in Ivano-Frankovsk. ![image 8765](media/2025-08-30_09-12-1756545172-712272.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence includes an image of a destroyed aircraft inside a hangar, which the source suggests may be an F-16. However, the image does not match the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Ukraine has F-16 fighter jets and that some have been lost during the conflict with Russia.

Therefore, it is impossible to verify if the image depicts a Ukrainian F-16 that was shot down by Russia. `false`
