The claim '<image:25> This image shows a military parade of Poland's army on August 14, 2024, preparing for war with Russia.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a military parade in Poland, which is held annually on August 15th, as reported by the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed](https://apnews.com/article/poland-armed-forces-day-russia-army-parade-db5c8663bf0b6e3c403b0c8482da4aed)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/europe/poland-military-parade-europe-clout-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/europe/poland-military-parade-europe-clout-intl)). The claim's date and the assertion that the parade was in preparation for war are not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
