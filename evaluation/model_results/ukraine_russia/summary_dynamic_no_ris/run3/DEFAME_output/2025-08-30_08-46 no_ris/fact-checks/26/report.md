## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention Zelenskyy stating that the U.S. would have to send their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) both fact-checked claims that Zelenskyy said American sons and daughters would have to fight or die in Ukraine, and found them to be false. The VOA article clarifies that the statement was taken out of context from a press conference on February 24, 2023. The People article ([https://people.com/politics/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-wants-his-children-to-know-about-the-invasion/](https://people.com/politics/ukraines-president-zelenskyy-wants-his-children-to-know-about-the-invasion/)) does not mention any statements about the U.S. sending their sons and daughters to die for Ukraine.

The CNN article explains that Zelenskyy predicted that if Ukraine loses the war, the U.S. would have to send troops to defend NATO member countries in the Baltics.


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Zelenskyy did not make the statement attributed to him. Fact-check articles from reputable sources like Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) debunked similar claims, clarifying that the statement was either taken out of context or misattributed.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February 2025, but did not confirm the specific quote. Subsequent searches found fact-checks from reputable sources like Voice of America and CNN, which debunked similar claims, confirming that Zelenskyy did not make the statement.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy occurred in February 2025, there is no evidence to support the statement attributed to Zelenskyy. Fact-checks from sources like Voice of America ([https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/fact-check-no-zelenskyy-did-not-say-american-sons-and-daughters-will-have-to-die-in-ukraine/6986873.html)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/politics/fact-check-zelensky-americans-fighting-ukraine-video)) debunked similar claims.
