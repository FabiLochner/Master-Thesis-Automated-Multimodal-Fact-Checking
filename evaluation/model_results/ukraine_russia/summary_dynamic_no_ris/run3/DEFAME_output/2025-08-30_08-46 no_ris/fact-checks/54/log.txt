The claim 'Ukraine is selling half of the armaments it receives from the United States' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there are reports of corruption within the Ukrainian defense sector, including inflated prices for military equipment ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/2/ukraine-says-defence-sector-corruption-scheme-uncovered), [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-uncovers-major-corruption-scheme-defense-procurment-days-after-restoring-anticorruption/)), there is no mention of Ukraine selling armaments received from the United States. Sources like Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/21/tracking-us-and-nato-support-for-ukraine-a-full-breakdown)) and the Kiel Institute's "Ukraine Support Tracker" ([https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/)) detail the aid provided but do not mention any arms sales.

So, the overall veracity is: false
