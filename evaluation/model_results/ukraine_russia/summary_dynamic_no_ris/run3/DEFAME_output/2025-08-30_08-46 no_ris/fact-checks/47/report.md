The other source, [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/coffin-was-not-published-by-charlie-hebdo/), indicates that the magazine did not release an issue on that date, and the serial number matches an issue from March 26, 2025. ![image 14](media/47.jpg) ![image 8652](media/2025-08-30_08-58-1756544294-074392.jpg)
