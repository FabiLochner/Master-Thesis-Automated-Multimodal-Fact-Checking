## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that in November 2024, a man named Nikita Zhuravel was sentenced to 14 years in prison. However, the Reuters report indicates that the 14-year sentence was for treason, separate from his previous conviction for burning the Quran. The Moscow Times and Meduza state that the 14-year sentence is the total time in prison, which includes the sentence for burning the Quran and an additional sentence for treason.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate as the man was sentenced to 14 years in prison in November 2024. The sentence was related to the burning of the Quran, although the 14-year sentence was for treason, with the Quran burning conviction contributing to the total time. `true`
