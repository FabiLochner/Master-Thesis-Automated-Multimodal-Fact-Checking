The claim 'Mexican President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum rejected an invitation to Ukraine by Volodymr Zelenskyy and said towards him on September 17, 2024: 'If I wanted to see a drug addict, I'd just take a walk around Tijuana.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Claudia Sheinbaum made a specific statement about drug addicts and Tijuana in response to an invitation from Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not supported by the available evidence. While she did decline the invitation to visit Ukraine, as reported by multiple sources ([https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/](https://www.intellinews.com/mexico-s-president-elect-sheinbaum-turns-down-zelensky-s-invitation-to-ukraine-344262/), [https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2024/09/18/mexican-president-elect-declines-zelenskyys-invitation-to-visit-ukraine/), and [https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-focuses-on-domestic-issues-50451798.html](https://english.nv.ua/nation/sheinbaum-declines-zelenskyy-s-invitation-to-visit-ukraine-344262/)), there is no evidence to support the specific quote attributed to her.

So, the overall veracity is: false
