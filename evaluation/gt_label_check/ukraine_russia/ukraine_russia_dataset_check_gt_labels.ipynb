    "The purpose of this script is to go through the final datasets (gaza-israel and ukraine-russia) and for each claim check whether the final aggregated ground truth label is actually correct. This is done, since the first DEFAME model evaluation (on gaza-israel dataset) has shown that some of the ground truth labels from the fact-checking websites are incorrect, i.e. that claims are inconsistently labeled within each websites but also between websites. The goal is to find out the extent of wrong ground truth labels and think about whether the label aggregation into four final labels (\"True\", \"False\", \"Misleading\", \"NEI\") actually makes sense or whether, e.g., \"False\", \"Misleading\" and \"NEI\" should be one category."

The poll showed 37% of respondents do not trust him.\\nAnton Hrushetskyi, director of KIIS, told Reuters that while similar, trust and approval are not identical concepts. He said a person can approve of someone's activities, but that does not necessarily mean that they trust them.\\nOlga Onuch, a professor in comparative and Ukrainian politics at the University of Manchester who worked with KIIS to produce the surveys, said in a statement on Wednesday, opens new tab: “Trump’s claim is not only factually incorrect, but also irresponsible and anti-democratic - Zelenskiy remains a fairly popular political leader in Ukraine.

While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation.

       "23  It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.\\nTrump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false.   \n",

       "46   Misbar reviewed Trump and Netanyahu’s full meeting, finding that the claim originated from a misinterpretation in Netanyahu’s statement about the situation in Gaza. After a reporter asked Trump whether the resettlement plans for Gaza were still on the agenda or not, Trump passed the question to Netanyahu, who said that Gaza is “closed in.” Netanyahu answered that people in other war zones, specifying Syria and Ukraine, had a choice to leave the country. Gaza, however, is the only place where people are locked in. He claimed Israel was not restricting them. Netanyahu then asked, “What is wrong with giving people a choice?” referring to the resettlement plans for Gazans.   \n",

Check Your Fact reviewed Charlie Hebdo’s magazine covers, such as the March 19 cover. No such cover shows Zelenskyy in a coffin. A wider search of the magazine’s website also did not yield any results for this claim. Martin Lom, a Charlie Hebdo journalist, told Logically Facts that the image is fake. “Yes, it’s a fake, and it’s common since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The official cover from the week is always pinned on the X official account of the journal,” Lom told the outlet.   \n",

The video, which included frames similar to the viral image, showed Zelenskyy visiting an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. According to AFP’s description, Zelenskyy visited the United States at the time to seek permission to use Western weapons against targets in Russia.

Even though he went on to say that he was \"interested primarily from the standpoint of death,\" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed.

Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: \"Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months.\" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were \"recoverable.\" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a \"minimum\" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Claims that NATO weapons and ammunition are being put on sale on the dark web have re-surfaced in recent months, but as other outlets have reported, there is no evidence that any such products have actually made it into the hands of a prospective buyer. A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support.</td>\n",

The claim emerged after Germany’s Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, criticized the exclusion of European countries from U.S.-Russia talks on the Ukrainian war, which were recently held in Saudi Arabia. Baerbock argued that lasting peace in Europe cannot be achieved without European involvement, warning that temporary peace would allow Russia to regroup for future conflicts. She also stated that downplaying Europe’s role would benefit Russia and called for greater confidence in dealing with the new U.S. administration.   \n",

A closer review of Scholz’s speech reveals that he referred to “Notlage,” not “Notstand” as claimed. In the video, Scholz said, “The Bundestag should pass a resolution as soon as possible according to which the war in Ukraine and its serious consequences for the security of Germany and Europe are classified as an emergency (Notlage) within the meaning of Article 115 paragraph two of the Basic Law.” In German, “Notstand” means a state of emergency that would severely restrict citizens’ rights. However, “Notlage” appears in the German Basic Law and signifies an urgent situation, but it does not equate to a government-imposed state of emergency.”   \n",

However, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had a call with Putin on February 12, 2025, during which they discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, energy, artificial intelligence, and various other subjects. During the call, both presidents agreed to have their teams start negotiations immediately. Trump said he would call President Zelenskyy to inform him of their decision, which he planned to do while writing the post. Media outlets also reported that Ukraine talks would start, citing Trump’s post, but did not report that Trump had reached an agreement to end the war.   \n",
       "53  For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term \"lost\" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was \"interested primarily from the standpoint of death,\" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed. A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000. In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: \"Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months.\" Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were \"recoverable.\" Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a \"minimum\" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550.   \n",

A Newsweek analysis of similar claims made in 2022, the year the war began, reveals a coordinated effort by Russian disinformation networks to spread false narratives about Ukraine's handling of Western-supplied weapons. This effort has included fabricated dark web ads, with pro-Russian outlets circulating images of a supposed Javelin anti-tank weapon for sale online. However, the listing was traced back to pro-Russian Telegram channels, and the images themselves dated to 2014— preceding both the war and the current levels of U.S. military support.   \n",

       "56  Misbar investigated the circulating claim and found the claim to be fake; Ben Stiller has publicly denied these allegations, stating that he completely self-funded his trip and received no payment from USAID. Stiller met with Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv as part of his role as an ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in 2022. In response to the circulating video, Stiller took to X to refute the claims, stating, \"These are lies coming from Russian media. I completely self-funded my humanitarian trip to Ukraine. There was no funding from USAID and certainly no payment of any kind. 100% false.\" Furthermore, there is no evidence to support that E! News posted that video.   \n",

For example, the Associated Press withdrew their story. “The Associated Press has withdrawn its story about U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard saying President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘are very good friends.’ Gabbard was talking about Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The AP will publish a corrected version of the story,” reads the AP’s withdrawal notice.

       "64   Users Misunderstood Macron’s Reference to the Bucha Massacre Misbar’s team reviewed the viral video some users shared supporting their claim and found that Macron was referring to the Bucha massacre During the press conference, a journalist asked the French president what he would advise Trump to ensure strong and enduring negotiations with Putin, considering that Macron was the last leader to meet Putin before Ukraine’s invasion. In his French accent, Macron replied that he would never offer advice to Trump. He added that he ceased his discussions with Putin “after Bucha and the war crimes,” explaining that, at the time, Macron believed that France “had nothing to get from him.” In the press conference clip, published by several outlets including CTV News, the word “Bucha” is clearly audible in Macron’s French accent, not “butcher.”   \n",

This transition, driven by fears of China's rapid nuclear expansion and Russia's confrontational rhetoric, suggests a shift from merely updating to actively growing its nuclear weapons. While the Biden administration continues to embrace the vision of a nuclear-free world, it recognizes that new arms control agreements are becoming less likely. The United States hopes to compel China and Russia into negotiations by demonstrating its willingness to increase nuclear capabilities if necessary.   \n",
       "77  Poland Celebrates Historic Red Army Defeat On August 15, the same footage appeared on DW with the comment: “With tensions rising at its eastern borders, Poland put on a big show with a military parade to celebrate Armed Forces Day. Those tensions are also the reason why the country is aiming to build one of Europe's largest military forces.” Contrary to claims on social media, Poland paid tribute to its historic 1920 triumph over the Red Army on Thursday, August 15, by remembering fallen Poles and showcasing new military equipment. On Armed Forces Day, around 2,500 Polish soldiers, along with dozens of U.S. and other allied forces, marched in military vehicles or tanks, or flew in fighter jets and helicopters in Warsaw, Poland's capital.   \n",
       "78   Outdated Photo Shows Ukrainian Tanks Destroyed by Russia Contrary to the circulating claim on social media, the photo was not captured in the context of Ukraine's recent advance in Russia's bordering Kursk region. Misbar’s team traced the photo to earlier publications and discovered it had been uploaded to a Vietnamese-language website. The photo, published on June 14, 2023, depicts Leopard 2 tanks and several Ukrainian armored vehicles reportedly destroyed by Russia in Zaporizhia. The photo was credited to Reuters. The website reported that Ukraine's \"iron fist\" 47th Brigade had suffered heavy losses at the hands of Russian forces. RT, the Russian television network, also uploaded the same photo in a published article on July 12, 2023.   \n",
