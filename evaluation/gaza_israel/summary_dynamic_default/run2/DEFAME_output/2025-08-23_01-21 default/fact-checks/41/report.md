## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Wikipedia, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested and detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil on March 8, 2025, who is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Mahmoud_Khalil]. The ACLU published a press release stating that ICE arrested Mahmoud Khalil in March 2025, and his legal team said that ICE unconstitutionally arrested Khalil in retaliation for his defense of Palestinian rights [https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil].

CNN published an article on July 11, 2025, discussing the ICE detention of Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg). The article mentions protests against his arrest and his claims of being treated poorly in detention.
