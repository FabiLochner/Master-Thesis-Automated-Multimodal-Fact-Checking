## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 13](media/15.jpg)) shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." According to a CBC News article from July 25, 2024, and a Globe and Mail article from July 24, 2024, the signs were hacked to display the pro-Palestinian slogans. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism, and a group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Montreal Gazette reported that electronic message boards at two construction sites in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now," on July 24, 2024. The signs were apparently hacked, and the City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility for the hack. (![image 13](media/15.jpg))

The Maple reported on September 5, 2024, about the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs. The signs were put up by LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P). Jeremy Levi, the mayor of the Montreal suburb of Hampstead, called on Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante to "take a stand and restore order in our city" regarding the signs. (![image 13](media/15.jpg))

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Suburban published an article about Mayor Valérie Plante being served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists, which displayed messages such as "Free Palestine" and "INTIFADA NOW" ![image 4933](media/2025-08-23_01-25-1755912319-611375.jpg). The article mentions that police are investigating the incident and that a group called Clash MTL claimed credit.

CityNews Montreal reported that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the violence at a pro-Palestinian protest in Montreal. ([https://montreal.citynews.ca/2024/11/25/plante-trudeau-condemn-violence-protest-montreal/](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2024/11/25/plante-trudeau-condemn-violence-protest-montreal/))


## Elaboration
The image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." The sign was hacked to display the message, and the City of Montreal called it an act of vandalism. The claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate. The traffic sign was hacked to display the message "Free Palestine. Escalate now," and the City of Montreal, not Mayor Valérie Plante, authorized it.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a hacked traffic sign in Montreal displaying a pro-Palestinian message, which was not authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante, but was instead the result of vandalism, as reported by the [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and the [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/).
