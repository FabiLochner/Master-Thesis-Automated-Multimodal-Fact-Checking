Content: The Suburban published an article about Mayor Valérie Plante being served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists. The signs displayed messages such as "Free Palestine" and were criticized for conveying anti-Israel messages. The article includes an image of a sign that says "INTIFADA NOW" <image:4933>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2024/11/25/plante-trudeau-condemn-violence-protest-montreal/): 
Content: The article from CityNews Montreal, published on November 25, 2024, reports that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the violence at a pro-Palestinian and anti-NATO protest in Montreal. The mayor stated that the violence "does not have its place here in Montreal." The article also mentions that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the violence.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a hacked traffic sign in Montreal displaying a pro-Palestinian message, which was not authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante, but was instead the result of vandalism, as reported by the [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809) and the [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
