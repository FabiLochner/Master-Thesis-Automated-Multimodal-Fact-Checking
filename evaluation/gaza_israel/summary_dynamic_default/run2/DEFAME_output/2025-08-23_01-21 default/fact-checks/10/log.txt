Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. It mentions Israeli strikes in Beirut, including airstrikes and the targeting of Hezbollah infrastructure. The article also mentions the near-total closure of Beirut's airport, which prevented medical aid deliveries. The World Health Organization reported that it would be unable to deliver a large shipment of trauma and medical supplies originally scheduled for October 4 to Lebanon due to the almost complete closure of Beirut's airport. <image:10> is not mentioned in the search result.

The claim '<image:10> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image is AI-generated, as confirmed by [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24) and Factly.in, and does not depict an authentic event. While there were Israeli airstrikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, the image is not a real depiction of those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
