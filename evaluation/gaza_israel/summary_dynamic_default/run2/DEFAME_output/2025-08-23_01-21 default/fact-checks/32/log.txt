Useful result: From [Source](https://cufi.org/issue/this-is-how-the-hezbollah-uav-evaded-detection-with-fatal-results/): 
Content: The search result from CUFI.org discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar. <image:1> The article states that Major General Tomer Bar ordered the elimination of Hezbollah’s UAV unit.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iaf-chief-preventing-all-weapon-transfers-from-iran-to-hezbollah-now-a-top-priority/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Tomer Bar, the commander of the Israeli Air Force, spoke on September 26, 2024, about preventing weapon transfers from Iran to Hezbollah. <image:k> The article also mentions the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah since October 8, 2023.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones): 
Content: The article from Press TV, published on November 27, 2024, reports that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024. The article states that the attack was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities. The article also mentions damage to Israeli infrastructure caused by Hezbollah since October 2023 and includes an image <image:5057> of damage to a building.

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed in a drone attack is false. Fact-checks from sources like AOL and Inshorts state there is no evidence to support the claim, and Tomer Bar is alive. While Press TV reported a Hezbollah claim of targeting his residence, this does not confirm his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
