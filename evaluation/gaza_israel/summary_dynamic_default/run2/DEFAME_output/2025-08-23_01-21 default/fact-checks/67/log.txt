Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-sectarian-clashes-druze-intl): 
Content: CNN reported on July 19, 2025, that Israel intervened in southern Syria due to clashes between the Druze minority group and Bedouin tribes. <image:1>. The article mentions Israeli airstrikes and a ceasefire. The article also mentions that the Syrian government declared a ceasefire and sent in troops. The article does not mention the Turkish President.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While reports from sources like PBS News and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/turkey-and-syria-accuse-israel-of-fostering-chaos-in-syria/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/turkey-and-syria-accuse-israel-of-fostering-chaos-in-syria/)) detail Israeli intervention in Syria and Turkey's Foreign Minister's warnings to Israel, there is no mention of the Turkish President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
