## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. The attack resulted in the deaths of 12 children. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) also discusses the attack and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site, where he was berated by residents.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which Israel attributed to Hezbollah. The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) articles confirm this.

The claim states that the image shows Smotrich taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not mention any attack on that date or Smotrich taking shelter.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The date of the alleged event and the location depicted in the image are not supported by the search results.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Smotrich was present at the site of an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which Israel attributed to Hezbollah. However, the claim states that the image shows Smotrich taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The provided evidence does not mention any attack on that date or Smotrich taking shelter.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at the site of an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, as reported by the BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)), the evidence does not support the assertion that the image depicts him in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.
