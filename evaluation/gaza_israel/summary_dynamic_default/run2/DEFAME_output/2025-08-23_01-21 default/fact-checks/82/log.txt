Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl): 
Content: The CNN article, published on July 29, 2024, discusses a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, which Israel blamed on Hezbollah. The attack killed 12 children. The article mentions that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site and was berated by residents. <image:51>

The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at the site of an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, as reported by the BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)), the evidence does not support the assertion that the image depicts him in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
