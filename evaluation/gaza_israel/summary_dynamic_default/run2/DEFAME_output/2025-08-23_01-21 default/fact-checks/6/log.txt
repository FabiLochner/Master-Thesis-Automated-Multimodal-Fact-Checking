The claim '<image:7> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Benjamin Netanyahu has been hospitalized for various health issues, including a hernia operation in April 2024 and prostate surgery in December 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024. The provided sources, such as Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahus-hernia-operation-was-successful-hospital-says-2024-04-01/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahus-hernia-operation-was-successful-hospital-says-2024-04-01/)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/netanyahu-hospital-prostate-budget-bill-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/netanyahu-hospital-prostate-budget-bill-intl-latam)), do not corroborate the specific details of the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
