Based on the available information, the claim is likely false.

`false`

While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as confirmed by multiple news sources ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago), [https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html], [https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)), the specific quote attributed to him in the claim is not found in the search results. Furthermore, a similar claim was fact-checked by Politifact and rated as false ([http://afactp.org/index-628.html](http://afactp.org/index-628.html)). Therefore, the claim is likely false.
