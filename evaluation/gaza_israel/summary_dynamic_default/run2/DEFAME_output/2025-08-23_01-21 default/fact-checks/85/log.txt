Useful result: From [Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza): 
Content: The search result from The National Desk states that a doctored image of a poll was shared on social media, falsely claiming that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians. The original image was a 2022 Channel 12 poll. The article mentions that the image was shared by Noura Erakat and Rashida Tlaib. The article was published on August 9, 2024. <image:5666>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The search result from Mondoweiss.net, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll showing that 65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, did not ask about rape; instead, it questioned whether the government relies on supporters of terrorism. The altered image falsely claims that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians, as confirmed by multiple sources ([<image:5662>](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner), [<image:5656>](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner), [<image:5661>](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
