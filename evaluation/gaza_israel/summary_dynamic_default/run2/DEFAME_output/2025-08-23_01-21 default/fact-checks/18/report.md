## Elaboration
The evidence includes an article from Entertainment Weekly that discusses whether Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame star was destroyed. The article mentions that her ceremony was disrupted by protestors.

The image search also shows images of vandalized stars, including Donald Trump's.

## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image shows vandalism of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but it does not confirm that it is Gal Gadot's star. The evidence also suggests that the image is not recent. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the image depicts a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there is no evidence to support that it is Gal Gadot's star or that the vandalism occurred recently. The evidence suggests that the image may be related to the vandalism of Donald Trump's star, which occurred in the past, as reported by [Times Now News](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/was-donald-trumps-hollywood-star-vandalized-recently-fact-checking-viral-claims-article-119361540).
