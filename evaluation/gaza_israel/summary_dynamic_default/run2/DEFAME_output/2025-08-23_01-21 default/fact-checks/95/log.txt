Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/israeli-attack-unwra-school-gaza-intl-latam): 
Content: CNN reports on an Israeli attack on an UNRWA school in Gaza on July 6, 2024, which killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured 50 others. <image:5801> The article also mentions protests in Tel Aviv against the Israeli government. The article was updated on July 7, 2024.

The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, in February 2023, as confirmed by sources like [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html), [SBS News](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/the-story-behind-this-turkey-earthquake-photo-that-many-will-never-forget/2ijedstvo), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl). The claim incorrectly associates the image with events in Gaza in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
