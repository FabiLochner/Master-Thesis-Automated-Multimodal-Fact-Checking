Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

An analysis by Truemedia, a tool that detects digitally manipulated images, indicates that the image is most likely AI-generated.Image: Screenshot truemedia.org

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

`false`

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”. 

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate. 

The group that was behind Barcelona’s solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‘Prou Complicitat’, or ‘Enough Complicity’, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni’s Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

“In this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

The remarks came two days after Barcelona’s city council [symbolically rejected](https://www.timesofisrael.com/barcelona-city-council-symbolically-rejects-mayors-decision-to-un-twin-with-tel-aviv/)
 left-wing Colau’s decision, with only her party voting in support.

On Thursday, the president of FC Barcelona invited representatives from Israel’s embassy to Spain to the soccer match against England’s Manchester United, in a sign of support for the Jewish state, according to a statement from the Israeli mission.

The statement said Joan Laporta stressed during a ceremony before the game that his team — which is popular among many Israelis — has long been committed to having good ties with Israel.

“The gesture of the Barcelona soccer team joins the wave of protests in Barcelona, Catalonia and all of Spain against the mayor’s decision,” the embassy said.

MADRID — The Spanish government on Friday criticized a decision by Barcelona’s mayor to cut the city’s ties with Israel, calling it a “unilateral move” that would not bring “anything good.”

In a letter last week to Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Barcelona’s leftist mayor Ada Colau said she had taken the step due to Israel’s “systemic violation” of the rights of the Palestinian population.

Colau, a former anti-eviction activist, cited several Israeli policies including its construction of settlements on lands claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.

“It would be a severe mistake to apply a policy of double standards and turn a blind eye to a violation that has been, for decades, widely verified and documented by international organizations,” she added.

The largely symbolic measure, which had been requested by dozens of local groups, includes the end of a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv.

Speaking at an event in Barcelona on Friday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called the move a “unilateral decision, and I understand an almost personal decision, by the mayor.”

“I believe that Barcelona’s vocation is to be an open city, as Spain is,” he added.

“I do not believe that anything good is achieved by suspending, cutting, expelling, nor is a dialogue built between Israel and Palestine,” he added.

After Colau announced last week she was suspending the twinning agreement, Madrid’s conservative Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida accused her of antisemitism and tweeted that he has written to Tel Aviv’s Mayor Ron Huldai to share “Madrid’s commitment to democracy and freedom.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war. The evidence indicates that the image was taken on February 16, 2023, and published in articles in February and September 2023. The evidence also mentions the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says

Your Message Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building. <image:5685>

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son mentioned his father used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024. The article also suggests that Meta may have been working with the American government to identify targets sought by Israel (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware (<image:5685>).

NIACouncil.org, published on December 27, 2024, states that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:5697>). The article mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024. There are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track his location via spyware. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The Tehran Times article ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)) mentions that Haniyeh's son stated his father used WhatsApp. The bne Gulf bureau article ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) mentions unconfirmed reports about WhatsApp being used for tracking.

The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the lack of definitive evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question. This one had a self-contained spyware, a covert scout concealed within the message that was to invade his device’s perimeter. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. This operation depicts how cyber espionage has slowly turned the conventional ware kind of ware where bytes and codes are more destructive than guns and grenades.

Thus, the employment of such enhanced spyware demonstrates how current cyber warfare strategies are constantly evolving. Spyware tools like Pegasus are interesting but present several ethical and legal issues primarily revolving on privacy and misuse."

Content: "High-tech Murder: How Israeli Intelligence used Spyware to Penetrate Iran’s Security The successful assassination of Haniyeh underscores the advanced intelligence capabilities of Israel. The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, marked the latest of these “targeted killings.” By targeting leaders and key operatives of terrorist organizations, Israel aims to disrupt planning, coordination, and execution of terrorist activities. By potentially using spyware planted through platforms like WhatsApp, Israel could have tracked Haniyeh’s movements and communications, pinpointing his location in real time. Haniyeh’s assassination is likely viewed as a direct challenge to Iran’s regional ambitions, necessitating a calculated response to maintain its credibility and deter future Israeli actions. Legal and Ethical Debate on Israel’s Assassination Policy In the year 2023 alone, Israel reportedly carried out numerous targeted assassinations of militants and political operatives affiliated with various groups, including more than 55 named Hamas members, military commanders, intelligence officials, and political figures. While Haniyeh’s assassination might cause short-term disruptions, it is unlikely to result in a significant long-term weakening of Hamas. Reports suggest that Israel employed spyware similar to Pegasus, a tool developed by the Israeli cyber-arms firm NSO Group. The Domino Effect: Haniyeh’s Assassination Could Alter Middle East Politics Haniyeh was a prominent political figure within Hamas, serving as the head of the political bureau. Haniyeh’s assassination in Iran rather than Qatar, where he was based for years, may also reflect Israel’s geopolitical calculations. Retaliation for Haniyeh’s assassination would align with Iran’s narrative that it is the champion of oppressed Muslim populations."

The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have used spyware to track Ismail Haniyeh's location and communications, potentially through platforms like WhatsApp. The Modern Diplomacy article ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)) indicates that Haniyeh's phone was potentially infiltrated.

The isdp.eu report ([https://www.isdp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-47-Alexander-new.pdf](https://www.isdp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Blog-47-Alexander-new.pdf)) further supports the possibility of spyware use, possibly through WhatsApp. This aligns with the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The claim is supported by the evidence, which suggests the use of spyware, potentially through WhatsApp, to track Haniyeh.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that there are reports suggesting Israeli intelligence may have used spyware, possibly through platforms like WhatsApp, to track Ismail Haniyeh's location and communications. While the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, it strongly suggests the possibility.

`true`

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

 to "raise and support armies" instead of its power to "Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia,"[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)
 avoiding the potential constraint on militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

Able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 not in the National Guard are defined in the Militia Act, and under the laws of some states, as the [unorganized militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#Unorganized_militia "Militia (United States)")

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")
 created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 [Military tribunals](/wiki/Military_tribunals_in_the_United_States "Military tribunals in the United States")

, and 345 to [penal labor](/wiki/Penal_labor "Penal labor")
 camps.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)
 Selective Service System registration for men on their 18th birthdays coupled with debate that the current all-male registration should be [expanded](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4730560-senate-democrats-require-women-draft/)
 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)
 conscription has generated fear of returning to the [Vietnam](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/us-military-draft-iran-selective-service-system)
\-era [draft](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-military-draft-rumors-swirl-after-iran-attacks-1865063)
. At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)
 among an apathetic American populace.

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

Jerusalem  — 

As the earliest stages of a [massive assault](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.

The takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/09/middleeast/nentanyahu-israel-gaza-analysis-intl)
 said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000.

Those plans have sparked growing condemnation [both internationally and domestically](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 over fears that the spiraling humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza will worsen – and that the lives of the remaining hostages will be further at risk from an expanded military operation.

The Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig. He [told CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-terror-attack/)
 in an interview in February of last year that once Israel invaded Rafah in southern Gaza, “the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion.”

Now, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war.

But that operation also targets a city that is home to more than a million people, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza.

More than 22 months since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, over 2 million people in Gaza have been struggling with severe hunger, disease and displacement amid Israel’s siege.

Cases of child malnutrition have tripled across Gaza in “less than six months,” according to the United Nations, as humanitarian workers [urged Israel](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fpress-releases%2F2025%2F08%2Fgaza-israel-must-restore-un-humanitarian-system-stave-starvation-say-un&data=05%7C02%7Cjerome.taylor%40cnn.com%7Cac449314fcdd4420e59b08dde02dbaa9%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638913209256057834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZFc6p7J7iZRcGh9Y8O%2BDrA9RqOX7abUnaTHPbP56Osg%3D&reserved=0)
 to lift severe restrictions on aid entering the besieged enclave.

Nearly 1 in 3 children are malnourished in Gaza City, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in what he called a “a man-made, preventable starvation”.

Netanyahu’s government have repeatedly denied that starvation is rife in the enclave.

Netanyahu defends Gaza City takeover as UN warns of ‘calamity’ and international condemnation grows](/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)

The Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military also said it has begun warning medical officials and international aid organizations in northern Gaza to plan for mass evacuation and displacement of the Palestinian population ahead of the planned Gaza City takeover.

The forced evacuation of the healthcare system risks worsening an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis gripping the besieged territory.

An Israeli military official told CNN that there will be “several steps” before Israeli ground forces move into the city. To continue fighting what has become the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.

But it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.

Defrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. “The war is over a year ago,” said Halutz, describing the current plan as having “no logic.” The retired general was careful not to call on Israelis to refuse to serve, but he encouraged reservists to “act according to his conscience, to his set of rules.”

Netanyahu promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. The IDF has begun preparing for the city’s evacuation by sending in more tents for displaced Palestinians, but evacuation warnings have not yet been issued.

When Israel’s security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.

After nearly [two years of war](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gaza-war-expansion-explainer-intl)
, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.

A new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40% of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13% were more motivated."
