## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump. According to a Wikipedia article, an attempted assassination occurred in Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024, by Thomas Matthew Crooks, but the Secret Service had increased Trump's security due to intelligence indicating Iran was plotting to assassinate him.

CNN and NPR reported on a Justice Department announcement of charges in an Iranian plot to kill Donald Trump, allegedly orchestrated by an Iranian government official. The accused, Farhad Shakeri, was tasked with planning the assassination and surveilling and assassinating two Jewish businesspeople in New York City.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reports that Israel received $17.9 billion in U.S. aid, including military aid and weapons. The U.S. has also helped Israel neutralize Iranian attacks. The U.S. has paused a shipment of bombs to Israel due to concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza. American adults are divided in their views of U.S. military aid to Israel. ([https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts))

Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs published a paper stating that the U.S. has spent at least $22.76 billion on Israel's military operations since October 7, 2023, including $17.9 billion in security assistance.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Iranian government official allegedly orchestrated a plot to assassinate Donald Trump. The plot also involved surveilling and planning to assassinate two Jewish businesspeople in New York City. The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans.

The evidence confirms that the U.S. provides significant financial and military aid to Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel wants American money to fund a war with Iran or American servicemen to fight it.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans is demonstrably false, as the evidence points to an Iranian plot. The claim that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran is not directly supported by the provided evidence, although the U.S. does provide aid to Israel.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. Evidence from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/doj-charges-three-iranian-plot-to-kill-donald-trump) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department) indicates an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, not one orchestrated by Jewish Americans. While the U.S. provides aid to Israel, as reported by the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts) and Brown University's Watson Institute, the evidence does not support the assertion that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran.
