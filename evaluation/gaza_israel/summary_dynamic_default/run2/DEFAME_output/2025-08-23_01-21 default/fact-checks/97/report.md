## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that the US was involved in the Israel-Hamas war, as it vetoed a UN resolution related to the conflict in November 2024. However, the evidence does not mention anything about the US reinstituting the draft.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the history and possibility of a military draft in the United States. One source is a Wikipedia article on conscription in the US, detailing the history of the draft, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and its end in 1973, and also mentions a 2007 article discussing the improbability of the draft returning (<image:k>). Another source, published on August 8, 2024, discusses the possibility of a draft in the US, mentioning debates about conscription in other countries and public concerns about a potential draft in the US (<image:k>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The ABC10 article fact-checks the claim that the US military draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war, published in 2025 by Google LLC ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war](https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war)).

A CNN article from August 20, 2025, discusses the Israel-Hamas war and potential manpower issues faced by the Israeli military, mentioning Israel calling up reservists and extending service, and military leaders calling for the government to draft ultra-Orthodox men into service ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl)).


## Elaboration
The evidence includes a fact-check from ABC10, published in 2025, which explicitly states that the US did *not* reinstitute the military draft for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while the US has been involved in the Israel-Hamas war, there is no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the conflict. A fact-check from ABC10 explicitly states that the US did not reinstitute the military draft.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A fact-check from ABC10, published in 2025, explicitly states that the US did not reinstitute the military draft for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)).
