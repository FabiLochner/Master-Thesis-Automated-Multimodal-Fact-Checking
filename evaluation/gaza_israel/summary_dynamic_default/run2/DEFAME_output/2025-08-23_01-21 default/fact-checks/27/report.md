## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2024 French protests against the National Rally, which occurred from June 9 to July 3, 2024, in response to the National Rally party's victory in the 2024 European Parliament election and the subsequent snap legislative elections. The protests were organized by various political organizations, unions, and student groups. The goals of the protests were to prevent the National Rally from achieving a majority in the French legislative elections and to form a left-wing coalition. The protests took place in multiple cities across France.

The BBC News article discusses protests in France after President Macron refused to nominate a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front alliance (NFP). The article mentions that the NFP won the most seats in the parliamentary elections. Politico reports that Marine Le Pen compared the left-wing New Popular Front alliance to rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol building.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 20](media/27.jpg) appears in multiple articles discussing rising antisemitism. The American Jewish Committee ([https://www.ajc.org/news/ajc-urges-eu-nations-to-act-on-dismaying-new-antisemitism-report](https://www.ajc.org/news/ajc-urges-eu-nations-to-act-on-dismaying-new-antisemitism-report)) uses the image in an article about antisemitism in Europe.

Vanity Fair ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html)) also feature the image in articles about antisemitism, with the Vanity Fair article specifically mentioning a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris in July 2014 where a swastika was painted on a statue.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts a protest, but it does not directly link it to the 2024 French parliamentary elections or Le Pen's victory. The reverse image search indicates the image has been used in articles about antisemitism and a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris in July 2014. The web search results confirm that there were protests in France in 2024 against the National Rally.

The claim's assertion that the image shows a protest against Le Pen's victory in 2024 is not directly supported by the evidence. The image's context appears to be related to antisemitism and pro-Palestinian demonstrations, not necessarily the 2024 elections.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to confirm the date and context of the image, and whether it is related to the 2024 French elections.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the image is related to antisemitism and pro-Palestinian demonstrations, not necessarily the 2024 French elections. While there were protests in France in 2024, the image's context appears to be different. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim has been used in articles about antisemitism and a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris in July 2014, as evidenced by sources like the [American Jewish Committee](https://www.ajc.org/news/ajc-urges-eu-nations-to-act-on-dismaying-new-antisemitism-report), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market), and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html). While there were protests in France in 2024, the image's context appears to be unrelated to the 2024 French parliamentary elections or Le Pen's victory.
