The claim '<image:9> This image shows an Israeli missile attack on Iran in the early hours of October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran on October 26, 2024, cannot be verified. While there were indeed airstrikes on that date, the image search did not yield any results that matched the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
