CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence for the story, and USAID spent no money on condoms in the entire Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. <image:k>

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims)) discussed Donald Trump's claim, stating there is no public evidence to support it. <image:i> The International Medical Corps (IMC) stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms or provide family-planning services in Gaza. The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)) also reported no evidence to support the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)), Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims)), and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)), found no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was allocated for condoms in Gaza.

The White House provided no evidence, and USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The International Medical Corps (IMC) also confirmed that no US government funding was used for this purpose.

The claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza is not supported by evidence. Multiple sources, including CNN, Al Jazeera, and the Associated Press, have fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it. The White House offered no evidence, and USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the specified fiscal years.
