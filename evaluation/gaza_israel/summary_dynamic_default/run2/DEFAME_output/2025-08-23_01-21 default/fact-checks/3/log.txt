Useful result: From [Source](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/): 
Content: The article from Khaosod English discusses fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, into an occupied land. The article mentions that the Prime Minister of Thailand assured the public that the fears about the "takeover" of the town of Pai by Israelis is unsubstantiated. The article also mentions that the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok urged Israeli tourists to respect local ways and culture. The article was published on February 23, 2025. <image:4> shows a picture of a gathering. <image:540> is a video. <image:537> is a picture.

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a gathering in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, as confirmed by multiple news sources, including the [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai) and [Khaosod English](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/). However, the provided evidence does not support the assertion that the individuals in the image have ceased fighting in Gaza and Lebanon.

So, the overall veracity is: false
