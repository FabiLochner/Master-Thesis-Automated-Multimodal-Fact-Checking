## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reported on February 23, 2025, that police found no evidence of Israeli influence in Pai district, Thailand, and that 4,573 Israelis visited Pai as of February 19, 2025. The Nation ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) published an article on February 18, 2025, refuting claims of an Israeli "promised land" in Pai district, stating that Israeli tourists visit legally and mentioning a Chabad House.

Khaosod English ([https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) discussed fears among some Thais about Israelis in Pai District, with the Prime Minister assuring the public that these fears are unsubstantiated. The Israeli Embassy in Bangkok urged Israeli tourists to respect local culture. The article includes an image of a gathering (![image 4](media/3.jpg)) and a video (![image 540](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873171-303134.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image depicts a gathering in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025. The Bangkok Post and The Nation articles from February 2025 refute claims of Israeli settlements or dominance in Pai. Khaosod English also discusses the presence of Israelis in Pai, including an image of a gathering, and addresses local concerns. The evidence does not support the claim that the Israelis in the image have stopped fighting wars in Gaza and Lebanon.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the image is related to Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025. However, the claim that the Israelis in the image have stopped fighting wars in Gaza and Lebanon is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a gathering in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, as confirmed by multiple news sources, including the [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai) and [Khaosod English](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/). However, the provided evidence does not support the assertion that the individuals in the image have ceased fighting in Gaza and Lebanon.
