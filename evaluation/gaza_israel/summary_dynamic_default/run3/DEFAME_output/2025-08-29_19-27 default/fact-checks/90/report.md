## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). The ESPN article notes that this is the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the last two Olympics, and the AP article mentions that in the Tokyo Olympics, Fethi Nourine withdrew to avoid a potential matchup with Butbul. ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg) <image:i> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not make weight, which prevented a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. The International Judo Federation is investigating the situation.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Dris withdrew to avoid the match. However, the ESPN article ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) mentions that this is the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the last two Olympics, and the AP article ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)) notes that Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics to avoid a potential matchup with Butbul.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not make weight, preventing a match against an Israeli opponent at the Paris Olympics. While the reason for not making weight is under investigation, the claim is supported by multiple reliable sources.
