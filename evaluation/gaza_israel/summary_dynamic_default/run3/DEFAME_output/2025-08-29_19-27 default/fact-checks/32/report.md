## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources confirm that the claim of Major General Tomer Bar's death is false. An AOL fact-check published on December 12, 2024, states that there are no media reports confirming his death and that he is not listed among the soldiers and other military personnel killed since Oct. 27. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html)) ![image 6024](media/2025-08-29_19-39-1756496359-839555.jpg)

According to Inshorts, Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed by Hezbollah in a November drone attack on his Tel Aviv residence.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024, which was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities (![image 6055](media/2025-08-29_19-39-1756496394-632192.jpg)). CUFI discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar, stating that he inspected the Golani Training Base site after the drone strike (![image 6085](media/2025-08-29_19-40-1756496413-702200.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hеzbollаh in a drone attack in Tel Aviv in November 2024 is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL fact-check and Inshorts, confirm that Tomer Bar is alive. While Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted his residence in Tel Aviv with a drone attack, and CUFI mentions a drone strike and Tomer Bar inspecting a site, these reports do not confirm his death.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that Tomer Bar is alive, despite reports of a drone attack on his residence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hеzbollаh is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL fact-check ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html)) and Inshorts, confirm that he is alive. While there are reports of a drone attack on his residence, they do not confirm his death.
