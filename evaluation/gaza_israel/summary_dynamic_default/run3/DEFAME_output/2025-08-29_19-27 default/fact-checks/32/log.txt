Useful result: From [Source](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones): 
Content: Press TV reports that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024. <image:6055>. The article states that the attack was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities.

Useful result: From [Source](https://cufi.org/issue/this-is-how-the-hezbollah-uav-evaded-detection-with-fatal-results/): 
Content: The search result from CUFI discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar. <image:6085>. It states that Major General Bar inspected the Golani Training Base site after the drone strike.

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hеzbollаh is false. Multiple sources, including an AOL fact-check ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html)) and Inshorts, confirm that he is alive. While there are reports of a drone attack on his residence, they do not confirm his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
