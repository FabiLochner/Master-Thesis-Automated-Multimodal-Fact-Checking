## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)) reported on Israeli airstrikes in Beirut on September 28, 2024, that resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Guardian article mentions the airstrikes leveled a city block.

The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/)) also reported on the Israeli airstrike in Beirut targeting Hassan Nasrallah. The Washington Post article includes the image in the claim (![image 24](media/35.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli airstrikes occurred in Beirut on September 28, 2024, and that Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, was killed in these strikes. The Washington Post published the image in the claim, which depicts what appears to be the remains of a ring.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the image shows the remains of Nasrallah's ring. However, the image is associated with the event of Nasrallah's death in an Israeli airstrike.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it is not possible to verify it definitively without additional information.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 24](media/35.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search reveals that the image (![image 24](media/35.jpg)

## Elaboration
The reverse image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim. The image is associated with the event of Nasrallah's death in an Israeli airstrike, but there is no explicit confirmation that the image shows the remains of Nasrallah's ring.

Therefore, the claim remains likely true, but it is not possible to verify it definitively without additional information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Kashif.ps ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/09/29/the-ring-photo-is-old-and-does-not-belong-to-hassan-nasrallah/)) states that the image of the ring remains (![image 24](media/35.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence from Kashif.ps ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/09/29/the-ring-photo-is-old-and-does-not-belong-to-hassan-nasrallah/)) explicitly contradicts the claim. It states that the image of the ring is old and does not belong to Hassan Nasrallah.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results indicated that the image was associated with the event of Nasrallah's death in an Israeli airstrike. However, a subsequent search revealed that the image is old and does not belong to Hassan Nasrallah.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Israeli airstrikes in Beirut on September 28, 2024, resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, the image of the ring (![image 24](media/35.jpg)
