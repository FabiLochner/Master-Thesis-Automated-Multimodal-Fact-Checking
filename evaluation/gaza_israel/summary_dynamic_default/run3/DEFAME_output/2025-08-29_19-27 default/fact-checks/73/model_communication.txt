Oct. 30, 2023, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

He is a young man of 19 in a blue t-shirt, standing in the foreground, with six relatives aged from childhood to middle age smiling behind him. Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:2108>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

### Analysis

The IDF stated that they had performed an assessment and concluded that Hezbollah was responsible for the rocket attack.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)
 IDF spokesman [Daniel Hagari](/wiki/Daniel_Hagari "Daniel Hagari")
 stated that the type of rocket used was an Iranian-made Falaq-1,[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
 carrying a 50 kg [warhead](/wiki/Warhead "Warhead")
, which has previously been used by Hezbollah, the only Iranian proxy to possess it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-ynet28july-36)
 The Israeli army posted pictures of Falaq-1 shrapnel that it said was found at the scene of the attack, but with no apparent pictures of the shrapnel in situ at the blast site.[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)

 projectile launched in the course of countering Hezbollah rocket fire aiming for Israeli military sites.[\[25\]](#cite_note-TheGuardian20240728-26)
 Iranian and Qatari state media claimed there were reports that an Iron Dome interceptor was to blame.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)

[\[41\]](#cite_note-42)
 Additionally, _[Al-Mayadeen](/wiki/Al-Mayadeen "Al-Mayadeen")
_, a Lebanese outlet with close ties to Hezbollah, stated that the blast site was inconsistent with a Falaq-1, which it said would have left a larger impact crater;[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)
 subsequent to the report, the Israeli government voted to ban _Al-Mayadeen_ from operating inside Israel.[\[42\]](#cite_note-43)

According to US intelligence, there were no doubts that Hezbollah was responsible but it was not certain if Hezbollah intentionally targeted the site or misfired.[\[29\]](#cite_note-APNews20240728-30)

Israeli authorities have characterized it as the deadliest attack on their civilians since the 7 October attacks.[\[27\]](#cite_note-CNN20240727-28)

The _Associated Press_ reported that rocket sirens sounded less than a minute before the explosion, which left a crater 2 meters wide. He stated that while the conflict would come at a significant cost, the goal is to decisively defeat Hezbollah and restore peace, and he has directed the Foreign Ministry to prepare a global campaign to support actions in Lebanon.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 27 Sep 202427 Sep 2024

Hezbollah has [confirmed](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
 that its leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/liveblog/2024/9/28/israel-attacks-lebanon-deaths-mount-as-beirut-buildings-bombed-to)
, has been killed in an Israeli air attack on the group’s headquarters in Lebanon’s capital Beirut.

Israeli media reported earlier on Saturday that Nasrallah was at the headquarters that was attacked and that Israel had used “bunker-busting” bombs.

The news comes after a night of Israeli bombardment around Lebanon.

Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and additional Hezbollah commanders were also killed in the huge air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military claimed.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said a total of six people were killed and 91 injured in the bombardment, which levelled six apartment buildings. Israeli air attacks continued to hammer Beirut’s southern suburbs and other areas of Lebanon into Saturday.

Where is Israel striking in Lebanon?
------------------------------------

The Israeli army says it has struck more than 140 Hezbollah targets since Friday evening, including the “central headquarters of Hezbollah” that, it says, was “embedded underneath residential buildings in the area of Beirut”.

On Saturday, Israel’s military said jet fighters had also attacked “dozens” of Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and various areas of southern Lebanon and the attacks are continuing.

Israeli forces said they had targeted buildings where weapons were believed to be stored as well as sites from where rockets were launched into Israel.

Israel launched an assault on the southern suburbs of Beirut in a series of attacks on Friday in the heaviest bombardment since it escalated its offensive against Lebanon earlier this month. “I have covered a lot of aftermaths of Israeli air strikes in these southern suburbs of Beirut but nothing like this.”

The latest wave of attacks on Beirut is reminiscent of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, one resident in Lebanon’s capital told Al Jazeera.

But just like then, these attacks will not do anything to stamp out Hezbollah, the resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

“At the end of the day they \[are\] just bombing, and killing people, and displacing people,” he said.

“\[Israel’s attacks\] won’t stop anything in the south … The rockets are there, the men are there.”

How many people have been hurt?
-------------------------------

As well as those killed in the assault in which Israeli forces killed Nasrallah, reports on Friday indicated at least 76 had been wounded.

On Saturday, Lebanon Civil Defense said one of its staff had been killed while providing emergency services in southern Beirut in the aftermath of the intense Israeli attacks on Friday evening.

One other staff member is in critical condition, Lebanon’s Civil Defense added.

The country’s state-run National News Agency reported that 11 doctors, nurses and paramedics had been killed and 10 others wounded in Israeli army attacks on civil defence centres and a medical clinic.

These attacks were carried out on the towns of Taybeh and Deir Siriane, close to the Israeli border.

Israel’s attacks on Lebanon have killed more than 700 people since Monday.

In a separate statement, Lebanon’s Health Ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop admitting nonemergency cases until the end of next week to make room for patients from Beirut’s southern suburbs.

What about the people in the residential buildings?
---------------------------------------------------

Dahiyeh is a densely populated area, home to more than half a million civilians, many of whom had been scrambling to evacuate to safety as Israel started attacking the area last week. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged Israel will continue its attacks.

Speaking at the United Nations in New York City on Friday, just hours before the attacks, he said, “As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely.”

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who is also in New York at the UN General Assembly, said in a statement that “the new aggression proves that the Israeli enemy does not care about all international efforts and calls for a ceasefire.”

One resident who lives in the neighbouring Palestinian refugee camp, Bourj el Barajneh, told Al Jazeera the attack shook the entire area and camp residents are now fleeing to other areas.

Was there any warning?
----------------------

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in a news briefing that Israel did not inform the United States in advance of the attack, but that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke by phone with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while the attack was in progress.

The attacks came as reports had emerged in recent days that negotiations for a ceasefire may be under way. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said the attacks destroyed at least seven buildings in the Haret Hreik suburb of the neighbourhood, turning them into a pile of rubble. While Hezbollah has its headquarters in the area, Dahiyeh “is a suburb, just like any other suburb in the world”, said Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem.

“Many families were starting to think about leaving, weighing their options, but where?” he said, noting that locations across Lebanon have been hit by attacks in recent days. Attacks on Beirut and areas around Lebanon continued through the night into Saturday.

More than a dozen explosions were reported in the neighbourhood of Dahiyeh, which had already been hit by air raids in recent days. Civil defence teams are working on putting out multiple fires in the area and have asked people to donate blood due to the likelihood of a high number of casualties.

The explosions were heard as far away as Jounieh, a 25-minute drive north of Beirut. “This attack was massive,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr."

Israel Preempts Hezbollah Attack
================================

\- Tuesday, August 27, 2024 by [Ari Cicurel](https://jinsa.org/person/ari-cicurel/)
 and |

Share:

_On August 25, Israel disrupted a planned, massive Hezbollah attack by preemptively striking and neutralizing roughly two-thirds of the projectiles that the terrorist group planned to launch from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah nevertheless managed to fire at least 230 rockets and 20 drones in retaliation for the Israeli strike that killed its most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, on July 30._

_Israel’s preemptive strike combined with its successful air defenses marked substantial victories that strengthened its deterrence and signaled its ability to thwart a large attack from Hezbollah. That Hezbollah delayed its retaliatory strike for almost four weeks, that it limited its attack relative to the 4,000 rockets it is capable of launching daily, and that Iran chose to stay out of the fighting entirely all demonstrate the deterrent impact of close U.S.-Israeli coordination and the deployment of strong military forces to the Middle East. 
_

[Click here to read the NatSec Brief.](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Israel-Preempts-Hezbollah-Attack-NatSec-Brief-4.pdf) To deter further escalation, the United States should maintain its strong deployment of naval and air assets in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean regions and closely coordinate with Israel to help defend against further Hezbollah or Iran-linked attacks. These factors also indicate that neither Hezbollah nor Iran want to escalate to a full-scale war at this moment."

CNN  — 

As tit-for-tat strikes strain [a ceasefire](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-explainer-intl-latam/index.html)
 between Israel and Hezbollah less than a week since it went into effect, Israel’s defense minister on Tuesday threatened to directly target the Lebanese state should the agreement fall apart.

Monday was the deadliest day since that agreement came into force last Wednesday, with Israeli strikes killing nine in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah fired at Israeli-occupied territory, citing Israeli truce violations.

“If we return to war, we will act with strength, go deeper,” Israel Katz said during a visit on Tuesday to the 146th Division of the Israel Defense Forces, near the Lebanese border.

Were the ceasefire to collapse, he said, “there will no longer be any exemptions for the State of Lebanon. The attacks were retaliation for Hezbollah firing two rockets at Israeli-occupied territory – themselves a response to near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon beginning the day after a truce began last Wednesday.

The exchange of fire casts doubt on the longevity of the ceasefire brokered by the United States – though State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted on Monday that “we have not seen the ceasefire break down.”

Both the American and French governments have privately told Israel that they believe it is violating the agreement, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the defense ministry, said in an interview with Israel’s Kan radio. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement “approximately 100” times since the truce went into effect.

“Both the French and the Americans didn’t really like it,” Smotrich said, referring to Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the truce. The military has said that it acted “in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”

Those strikes led Hezbollah to target Israeli-occupied territory, at Shebaa Farms, on Monday. If until now we separated the State of Lebanon from Hezbollah – and the entirety of Beirut from Dahiyeh, which took very hard hits – this will no longer be the case.”

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz visits the 146th Division in northern Israel, near the Lebanese border, on December 3.

Elad Malka/Israeli Ministry of Defense

It comes a day after Israel conducted airstrikes across southern Lebanon. “But the IDF, in the days since the ceasefire, is enforcing it in a very determined way, both against Hezbollah and against civilians who are trying to return to villages in the border area without permission.”

Except for Tuesday, Israel has launched daily airstrikes in Lebanon since the day after a ceasefire went into effect last week. In a statement, the group said that Israel was guilty of “firing on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.”

Hezbollah’s rockets fell in an open area and injured no one. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a serious violation of the ceasefire,” and Israel launched airstrikes across southern Lebanon, killing nine, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Smotrich said the IDF had struck 29 targets in Monday’s attack.

Israeli officials contend that far from violating the ceasefire, they are acting to enforce it.

“Yesterday was the first test – firing toward Mount Dov as if it were outside the usual conflict or open to interpretation,” Katz said on Tuesday, using the Israeli term for Shebaa Farms, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and has occupied ever since. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory."

**JERUSALEM**

An adviser to Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli media on Wednesday.

Smotrich's adviser, who is a reserve soldier in the army's Alexandroni Brigade, was wounded but was in good health condition, Israeli Channel 12 reported.

It, however, didn't reveal his name, or when he was injured.

The Israeli army has deployed four army divisions for its ongoing ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

The Israeli army said early Wednesday that three soldiers were seriously injured in clashes in southern Lebanon.

Israel has mounted massive airstrikes across Lebanon against what it claims Hezbollah targets since Sept. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

The aerial campaign was an escalation in yearlong cross-border warfare between Israel and Hezbollah since the start of Tel Aviv’s brutal offensive on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 42,000 people, mostly women and children, since a Hamas attack last year.

At least 2,119 people have since been killed and 10,019 others injured in Israeli attacks in Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.

Despite international warnings that the Middle East region was on the brink of a regional war amid Israel’s relentless attacks on Gaza and Lebanon, Tel Aviv expanded the conflict by launching on Oct. 1 a ground invasion into southern Lebanon.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "Majdal Shams attack" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) describes a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, and mentions that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visited the site. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon)) reports on Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The JINSA article ([https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/](https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/)) discusses an Israeli preemptive strike against Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, but does not mention Smotrich. <image:51> <image:1>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The provided image shows individuals who appear to be in a public space, possibly a building. The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "Majdal Shams attack" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) describes a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, and mentions that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visited the site. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon)) reports on Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The JINSA article ([https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/](https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/)) discusses an Israeli preemptive strike against Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, but does not mention Smotrich. <image:51> <image:1>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported on December 3, 2024, that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the American and French governments believe Israel is violating the agreement. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl)) <image:k>

Drop Site News, dated August 29, 2025, discusses the situation in Gaza and Lebanon, mentioning Smotrich's plan for "total victory" in Gaza. ([https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily)) <image:51> Anadolu Agency reported on October 9, 2024, that an advisor to Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/adviser-to-israeli-finance-minister-injured-in-lebanon-clashes/3356587](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/adviser-to-israeli-finance-minister-injured-in-lebanon-clashes/3356587)) <image:i>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The provided image shows individuals who appear to be in a public space, possibly a building. The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister and that he has been involved in events related to the conflict with Hezbollah. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

Need in-depth geopolitical, security, and risk analysis of Eurasian countries and regions? This event, which occurred after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, underscores Tel Aviv’s strategic capacity to neutralise high-value targets linked to Iran-supported militant groups.

Historical context, such as the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus and the subsequent [Tehran’s retaliatory missile and drone strikes](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/04/14/iran-attack-israel-report/)
, suggests that **this escalation could provoke a powerful response from Iran**. The broader geopolitical repercussions could influence global investment patterns, with investors potentially seeking safer markets, affecting economic growth in the region.

### Background Information

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of _Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya_ (Hamas), was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard after a targeted strike [on his residence](https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779)
. This rhetoric implies a possible escalation in retaliatory measures against Israeli targets, both domestically and potentially internationally.

**Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination poses a significant threat to the fragile ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas**. **_Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran; Hamas blames Israel._**
2. Haniyeh was in the city to attend the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Hamas and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed the attack, attributing it to Israeli forces**. This incident has further inflamed the already volatile situation, raising fears of a widespread escalation that could engulf multiple countries and lead to severe humanitarian crises.

### Contextual Analysis

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran signifies a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Various international organisations and governments have criticised Haniyeh’s killing, emphasising the need for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

**The recent Israeli airstrikes in a southern suburb of Beirut, resulting in the targeted killing of Fuad Shukr**, [a senior Hezbollah commander](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwxyjydlyo)
, serves to underscore Israel’s proactive stance in neutralising perceived threats from regional adversaries."

From [Source](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/): 
Content: "However, it is unlikely to impact the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip or the negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages.

Eight hours after the preemptive targeting of senior Hizbullah military leader Fouad Shuker by the Israeli Air Force in the Al-Dahyah neighborhood of Beirut on July 30, Iran officially confirmed that Ismail Haniyeh was killed early in the morning of July 31 in Tehran, along with his bodyguard Wasim Abu Shaaban.

Hamas confirmed his death, blamed Israel, and vowed revenge.

Israel has remained silent, with Prime Minister Netanyahu instructing ministers not to comment publicly.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing.

Israeli intelligence sources report that Ismail Haniyeh, based in Qatar, was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7.

Accounts from Tehran state that Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed in their apartment at a guest house for foreign leaders.

The preemptive targeting was possibly by a submarine-launched missile from a distance at the bedroom where Haniyeh was staying.

This event is a double blow to both Hamas and Iran.

Haniyeh played a crucial role in managing Hamas’s political strategies, building connections throughout the Muslim world, and securing donations to fund its terror activities.

The Preemptive Targeting of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran
====================================================

A Double Blow to Hamas and Iran

Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei’s declaration on July 31, 2024.

#### Table of Contents

Iran announced the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during his visit to Tehran, where he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pazashekian.

This event is significant both operationally and morale-wise. Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, condemned the assassination, calling it “a cowardly act that will not go unpunished.”

The movement will elect a new leader to replace Haniyeh.

This is another severe blow to Hamas’s morale and operations following the killing of Muhammad Deif, the supreme commander of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, a rival of Haniyeh, is likely to benefit from this development, as he commands Hamas in Gaza and holds a crucial bargaining chip – Israeli hostages.

Hamas asserts that Haniyeh’s killing is part of an Israeli effort to pressure its leadership regarding the hostages and maintains that this will not alter its stance.

The death of Ismail Haniyeh will not end the conflict in the Gaza Strip as long as Yahya Sinwar and other members of Hamas’s military leadership remain alive.

He was a key figure in Hamas’s alignment with Shiite Iran, as opposed to Khaled Mashaal, who favors closer ties with the Sunni “Muslim Brotherhood” axis, including Qatar, Turkey, and Pakistan.

Iran faces criticism for failing to adequately protect Haniyeh on its soil, marking a significant security lapse.

This incident adds to other security failures in Iran, such as the assassination of Fakhri Mohsen Zadeh, the so-called father of Iran’s nuclear program, by the Israeli Mossad in November 2020.

Haniyeh’s decision to leave Doha, Qatar, and attend the Iranian president’s inauguration in Tehran proved fatal, providing an opportunity for Mossad to target him.

Before his death, Haniyeh met with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Islamic Jihad leader Ziad Nachala.

It is believed that the Israeli Mossad avoided targeting Haniyeh in Qatar for two reasons: Qatar’s role as a mediator in the Israeli hostages’ negotiations and operational considerations.

Hamas claims that Haniyeh’s death will not alter its campaign against Israel, which has previously seen the elimination of key leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas. (res.) Maurice Hirsch](https://jcpa.org/researcher/maurice-hirsch/)

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.

## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli intelligence Ismail Haniyeh WhatsApp July 31 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The bne Gulf bureau reported on August 1, 2024, about the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, mentioning unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, and that the attack occurred in Tehran. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:6727>

SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit reported on July 31, 2024, that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, with Hamas blaming Israel. ([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)) <image:k> The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) reported on August 1, 2024, that Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, mentioning that Israeli intelligence sources reported Haniyeh was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on October 7. ([https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/)) <image:6741>, <image:6740>, <image:6744>, <image:6745>, <image:6746>, <image:6749>, <image:6750>, <image:6751>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, mentioning the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> Modern Diplomacy, on August 4, 2024, discussed the assassination of Haniyeh and the potential use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, suggesting that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications. ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/))


## Elaboration
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search revealed unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp. Subsequent searches provided additional context, including Iranian state media warnings about cell phone tracking and the potential use of spyware for surveillance. While the evidence supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, the exact method, specifically the use of WhatsApp, remains unconfirmed.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)
 to organizations funding relief in Israel and Palestine.

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."
