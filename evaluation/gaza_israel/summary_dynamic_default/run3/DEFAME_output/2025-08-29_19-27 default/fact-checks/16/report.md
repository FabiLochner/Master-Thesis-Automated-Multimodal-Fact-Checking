## Actions

web_search("Israeli Olympic team Bring Them Home 2024")
image_search("Israeli Olympic team Bring Them Home pool")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool (![image 14](media/16.jpg)). One source from Ynetnews.com contains an image of synchronized swimmers in a pool (![image 5919](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-064484.jpg)). Another source, from thv11.com, states that the image is not from the 2024 Olympics (![image 5920](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-610559.jpg)). The New York Times published an article about synchronized swimming at the Olympics (![image 5921](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-987880.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that the image depicts the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool. However, the evidence explicitly states that the image is *not* from the 2024 Olympics. Therefore, the claim that the image is from the 2024 Olympics is false.


## Final Judgement
The image does show the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool. However, the evidence indicates that the image is not from the 2024 Olympics.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image does show the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool, but evidence from thv11.com ([https://www.thv11.com/article/news/verify/olympics-verify/image-israeli-swimmers-bring-them-home-not-from-paris-2024-olympics/536-5f25fcff-c857-495b-8eba-3d6c5fb46ce9](https://www.thv11.com/article/news/verify/olympics-verify/image-israeli-swimmers-bring-them-home-not-from-paris-2024-olympics/536-5f25fcff-c857-495b-8eba-3d6c5fb46ce9)) confirms that the image is not from the 2024 Olympics.
