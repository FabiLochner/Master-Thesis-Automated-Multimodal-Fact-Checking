Additionally, there is a biography of Brigadier General John J. Campo ([https://dc.ng.mil/News/Biographies/Article/1512717/brigadier-general-john-j-campo/](https://dc.ng.mil/News/Biographies/Article/1512717/brigadier-general-john-j-campo/)), which also includes the image in the claim (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 1](media/0.jpg)) shows soldiers in Iraq, not General John Pagri in the Gaza Strip. The uniform pattern in the image was retired in 2019, and there is no US general with this name. ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html))

The United Nations website discusses the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in August 2025, but does not mention General John Pagri. ([https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250820.doc.htm](https://press.un.org/en/2025/db250820.doc.htm)) An article from The Times of Israel discusses a plan for Israel to take over vast areas of the Gaza Strip. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-takeover-plan-said-set-to-last-4-5-months-focus-on-gaza-city-strips-center/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-takeover-plan-said-set-to-last-4-5-months-focus-on-gaza-city-strips-center/))


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is of soldiers in Iraq, not General John Pagri in the Gaza Strip. The uniform pattern in the image was retired in 2019, and there is no US general with this name.


## Final Judgement
The image is of soldiers in Iraq, not General John Pagri in the Gaza Strip. The uniform pattern in the image was retired in 2019, and there is no US general with this name. The claim is therefore demonstrably false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image is of soldiers in Iraq, as confirmed by a reverse image search and the U.S. Army. Furthermore, there is no record of a General John Pagri, and the uniform in the image is outdated, as reported by [Yahoo News](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html).
