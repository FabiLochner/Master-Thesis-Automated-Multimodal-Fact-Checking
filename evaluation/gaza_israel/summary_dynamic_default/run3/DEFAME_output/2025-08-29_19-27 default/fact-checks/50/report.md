```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government discusses DNA testing and the Israeli Law of Return, including the potential use of genetic tests to determine Jewish identity for immigration purposes ([https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)). A welcome-israel.com article states that DNA testing is not banned in Israel, but it is not sufficient on its own to prove Jewish ancestry for citizenship or repatriation; it can be used as an additional tool (![image 1](media/0.jpg)) ([https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test](https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test)). Another Harvard University source discusses the use of genetic tests in Israel to determine whether potential immigrants are Jewish ([https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. The welcome-israel.com article explicitly states that DNA testing is not banned. The other sources discuss the use of DNA testing in the context of immigration and determining Jewish identity.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence from multiple sources confirms that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. While DNA tests may be used in specific contexts, such as for immigration purposes, there is no indication of a ban on conducting such tests.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, according to sources like the Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and welcome-israel.com ([https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test](https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test)). These sources discuss the use of DNA testing in the context of immigration and Jewish identity, but do not mention any legal restrictions on performing such tests.
