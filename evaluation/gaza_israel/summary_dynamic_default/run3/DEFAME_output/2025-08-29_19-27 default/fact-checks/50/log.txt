Useful result: From [Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html): 
Content: The search result from Harvard Kennedy School of Government discusses DNA testing and the Israeli Law of Return. The Israeli State may begin to use genetic tests to determine whether potential immigrants are Jewish or not. The article discusses the historical and legal context of secular and religious definitions of Jewishness and rights to immigration in the State of Israel.

Useful result: From [Source](https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test): 
Content: The article from welcome-israel.com, updated August 14, 2025, discusses DNA testing in Israel. It states that DNA testing is not banned in Israel, but it is not sufficient on its own to prove Jewish ancestry for citizenship or repatriation. DNA tests can be used as an additional tool to demonstrate a connection to Jewish heritage. <image:1>

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is true.
Justification: DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, according to sources like the Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and welcome-israel.com ([https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test](https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test)). These sources discuss the use of DNA testing in the context of immigration and Jewish identity, but do not mention any legal restrictions on performing such tests.
