## Claim
Claim: "![image 29](media/45.jpg) This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 29](media/45.jpg))
web_search("Greta Thunberg sign Fuck Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The reverse image search found the image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Fuck Israel" on multiple websites. One source is an article from NDTV.com, published on October 21, 2023, discussing Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza, but the image in the article is different from the one in the claim. Another source is an article from Ynetnews, which discusses Thunberg's shift to anti-Israel activism. The Ecologist also published an article on November 3, 2023, discussing a photo of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that says "Stand With Gaza". ![image 29](media/45.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)) report that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Germany" and "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)) also reported on the event.

The New York Post and Yahoo News included images of Thunberg at the rally, and The Telegraph also included a photo. ![image 392](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846185-389823.jpg), ![image 393](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846187-063198.jpg), ![image 394](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846189-584061.jpg), ![image 396](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846195-195779.jpg), <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Greta Thunberg did express the phrase "f–k Israel" at a rally. However, the claim states that she held a sign with the phrase written on it. The reverse image search did not find the exact image in the claim, but it did find articles discussing Thunberg's support for Gaza and anti-Israel activism. The web search found that Thunberg said the phrase at a rally in Germany.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as Thunberg did use the phrase. However, the evidence does not confirm that she held a sign with the phrase written on it.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg used the phrase "f–k Israel" at a rally, but the claim states that she held a sign with the phrase. The reverse image search did not find the exact image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While Greta Thunberg did say "f–k Israel" at a rally, as reported by the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)), the claim that she held a sign with the phrase is not supported by the evidence.
