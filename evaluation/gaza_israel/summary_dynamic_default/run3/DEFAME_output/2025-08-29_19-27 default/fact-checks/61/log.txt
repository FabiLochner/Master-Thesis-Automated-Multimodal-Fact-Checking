Content: The search result is from Sky News Arabia, published on October 11, 2023. It discusses the destruction of the Israeli Merkava tank. The article includes an image of the tank. <image:6610>

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image, likely taken in Palestine, was published in October 2023, as indicated by a reverse image search on Sky News Arabia, which contradicts the claim's date of July 2024.
