Useful result: From [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-flight-cancelations-ben-gurion-airport-2023-10): Found exact image on website with title: Travelers Face Canceled Flights, Chaos at Israel's Ben Gurion Airport
Content: The Business Insider article, published on October 10, 2023, discusses the chaotic situation at Ben Gurion Airport in Israel due to the war with Gaza. <image:2452> The article mentions canceled flights, long lines, and travelers trying to leave the country.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.dk/photos/israel-airport): Found exact image on website with title: 6975 Israel Airport Stock Photos & High-Res Pictures - Getty Images
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains stock photos and high-res pictures of Israel airports. The search result includes images of Ben Gurion Airport, including images of passengers waiting, flight cancellations, and security measures. <image:2454>, <image:2455>, <image:2456>, <image:2457>, <image:2458>, <image:2459>, <image:2461>, <image:2462>, <image:2464>, <image:2465>, <image:2466>, <image:2467>, <image:2469>, <image:2471>, <image:2472>, <image:2473>, <image:2474>, <image:2475>. Some images are dated from 2022, 2023, and 2024, and some are related to attacks by Palestinian factions, the Houthi group, and Iran. One image shows an Israeli security force taking measures after Yemen's Houthi group attacked Ben Gurion Airport on May 04, 2025.

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ben Gurion Airport in Israel, and while a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024, the image predates this event and is associated with flight disruptions due to the war with Gaza, making the claim misleading. The image appears in a Business Insider article from October 2023 and Getty Images stock photos.

So, the overall veracity is: false
