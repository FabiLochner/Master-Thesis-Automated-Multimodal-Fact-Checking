Content: NDTV published an article titled "Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping Against Hope". The article discusses the Bibas family, including Shiri, Ariel, Kfir, and Yarden Bibas, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The article mentions that Hamas claimed Shiri and her two sons are no longer alive, while Israeli authorities have not confirmed this. The article was published on December 4, 2023. <image:1>

The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family, but the title provided in the claim, "Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said," is not accurate. The actual title of the BBC article was "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)).
