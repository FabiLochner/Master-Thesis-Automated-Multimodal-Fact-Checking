Content: Al Jazeera published an article on October 14, 2024, about tents on fire in Gaza. The article includes an image of tents on fire <image:6641>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/26/hamas-rocket-attack-tel-aviv-israel-gaza): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on May 26, 2024, about a Hamas rocket attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which includes an image of tents on fire <image:6642>.

The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and images of tents on fire exist, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts tents on fire due to those strikes. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and further searches did not link the image to the specific event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
