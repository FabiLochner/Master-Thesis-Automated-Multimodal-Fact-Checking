Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09): Found exact image on website with title: Speaker Johnson demands Zelenskyy remove Ukraine's ... - AP News
Content: The AP News article, published on September 25, 2024, reports that House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remove Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. after Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition plant in Pennsylvania. <image:40> The visit, which included signing military ordnance, was criticized by Republicans as a partisan campaign event. The article also mentions that Zelenskyy met with the United Nations Secretary-General and is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden.

The claim '<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in September 2024, not Israeli bombs in March 2025. The shells were intended for Ukraine's defense against Russia, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza, as falsely claimed by the original post.
