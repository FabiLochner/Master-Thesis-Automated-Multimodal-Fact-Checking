## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris's campaign. In fact, one source indicates that Trump encouraged Netanyahu to take the deal. Furthermore, Newsweek reports that both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Trump and Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign. In fact, one source suggests Trump encouraged the deal, and both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu did speak on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire, there is no evidence to suggest that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign. In fact, one source indicates that Trump encouraged Netanyahu to take the deal, and both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248).
