Content: Reuters reported on August 2, 2024, that the Pentagon is deploying additional Navy warships to the Middle East to bolster defenses following threats from Iran and its allies. The U.S. is increasing support for the defense of Israel. <image:6730>

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The claim is **unverified**. While evidence confirms the deployment of U.S. warships to the Middle East in August 2024 to support Israel's defense, as reported by sources like the [Guardian](<image:1>), the claim that these warships were en route to the Lebanon coast cannot be verified. The reverse image search did not provide any information about the image's origin or context.

So, the overall veracity is: false
