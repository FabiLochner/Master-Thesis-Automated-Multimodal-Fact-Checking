## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025. The conference was held at the African Union headquarters. The sources do not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador, but rather that he was removed from the conference.

The African Union joined a case against Israel in February 2025, which may have influenced the decision to remove the ambassador. The Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the action.

Therefore, while the evidence confirms the ambassador's removal from a conference in Addis Ababa, it does not explicitly confirm that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the Israeli ambassador was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa in April 2025. However, the sources do not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.

`false`
