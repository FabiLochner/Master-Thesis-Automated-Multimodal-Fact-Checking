Content: ABC News published an article about the vandalism of Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <image:5946>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/hollywood-walk-fame-why-20-stars-are-disrepair-951150/): 
Content: The Hollywood Reporter published an article about the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The article includes an image of several stars on the Walk of Fame. <image:5947>

The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there have been instances of vandalism on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there is no evidence to support the claim that Gal Gadot's star was destroyed. The search results show vandalism of Donald Trump's star ([https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2018/07/25/trumps-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-vandalized/11314069007/](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2018/07/25/trumps-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-vandalized/11314069007/)) and Jenni Rivera's star ([https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/jenni-rivera-star-vandalized-hollywood-walk-of-fame/3454412/](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/jenni-rivera-star-vandalized-hollywood-walk-of-fame/3454412/)), but no information about Gal Gadot's star.
