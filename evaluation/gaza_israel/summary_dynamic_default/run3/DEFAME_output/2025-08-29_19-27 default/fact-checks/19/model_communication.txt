Our live coverage is ending now. And Harry Truman’s picture is now in the lobby, in a nice location, not in the lobby where it should have been, but that stopped a lot of fighting, and this stopped a lot of fighting,” he said.

“I hope we’re not going to have to” strike Iran again, he added.

From 7 Jul 2025

**Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived at the White House for his scheduled talks with [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 this evening.**

The Israeli prime minister met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this afternoon, the Associated Press reports, citing the prime minister’s office.

The visit comes as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage deal in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/06/gaza-mood-ceasefire-talks)
 continued for a second day on Monday.

[Trump has increased pressure](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza-trump-netanyahu-white-house-qatar-rcna217167)
 for a deal in Gaza in recent weeks and raised the possibility that a ceasefire could be declared in a matter of hours or days.

Hamas demands an Israeli withdrawal, while Netanyahu insists on Hamas disarming. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:

*   **Donald Trump hosted the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House today.** The visit comes as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage deal in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/06/gaza-mood-ceasefire-talks)

Donald Trump said he lifted the United States’s sanctions on Syria at the request of Middle Eastern leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu. They’re getting hit very hard now,” he said.

The president did not add any additional details.

Last wee, the Pentagon halted shipments of US Patriot air defence systems and other precision weapons to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 after concern that US stockpiles were running too low.

Trump and Netanyahu are answering questions about Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who won New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary.

In response to a question about Mamdani, who has said he would enforce the International Criminal Court’s arrest order if Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited New York city, Netanyahu said “I’m not concerned about that”.

Trump, who has threatened to deport Mamdani, who is a US citizen, said “I’ll get him out.”

Later Trump called Mamdani a “communist and said “he’s said some really bad things about Jewish people.”

**Donald Trump passed on a question about a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, asking Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to answer instead.**

“I think Palestinians should have all of the power to govern themselves, but none of the power to threaten us,” he said.

**Trump says Iran has approached the White House for talks following the United State’s strike on the country’s nuclear facilities.** He also compared the US’s strikes to the country’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan during World War II.

“I don’t want to say what it reminded me of but if you go back a long time ago, it reminded people of a certain other event. He will meet House speaker Mike Johnson tomorrow.

Earlier today, Trump said his representatives had met with Israeli officials about the raging conflict in Gaza, ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington next week. He also claimed he would resolve the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. 

After imposing his "Liberation Day" duties, he mocked tariff-hit nations, saying that they were ready to do anything while trying to "negotiate" trade deals with him.

Trump also said that his intervention and threats to cut off trade talks averted a major conflict between India and Pakistan after terrorists killed 26 tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam in April-- a claim India denies. 

He has also been credited for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after 12 days of military actions.

>  has successfully resolved several serious conflicts around the world. "Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War," he wrote.

The American leader said representatives of Qatar and Egypt, mediators in the conflict, would deliver "this final proposal."

"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better -- IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE," he added.

Trump earlier on Tuesday said he would be "very firm" with Netanyahu when they meet on July 7. The end of Israel's 12-day war with Iran -- which followed a US bombing mission on Tehran's nuclear sites -- has provided a window of opportunity for a deal, with Trump keen to add another peace agreement to a series of recent deals he has brokered.

### **'Negotiator-in-Chief' Trump**

President Trump has often boasted about his superior negotiation skills. Before being elected for his second term in the White House, Trump vowed to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine in "24 hours" after taking charge as President."

Washington CNN  — 

During her [first official White House briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/media/karoline-leavitt-first-press-conference/index.html)
 as President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had prevented a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Trump’s team, [she said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-january-28-2025/)
, used the president’s [pause on foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-impact/index.html)
 to thwart a plan in which “there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”

Leavitt’s Tuesday comments made headlines around the world. And when CNN asked Leavitt and her colleagues for any evidence, another White House official instead pointed us to comments from the State Department — comments that, as we’ll discuss below, did not even repeat Leavitt’s claim of a planned $50 million Gaza condom expenditure, let alone prove the claim.

**In three previous years under Biden, USAID spent _no_ money on condoms in the entire Middle East**: A detailed [federal report published last year](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 said USAID did not provide or fund _any_ condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

The report, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-executive-orders-transgender-troops-dei-covid-us-politics-live?page=with:block-679977268f086189f840e07b#block-679977268f086189f840e07b)
 by The Guardian on Tuesday, said the only Middle East contraceptives provided or funded by USAID during that three-year period went to the country of Jordan in fiscal 2023. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.” She did not specify how much of the $102 million in funding was intended for contraception, let alone for condoms in particular.

In an email to reporters earlier Tuesday, Bruce said the entity that was supposed to get $102 million is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that [operates two field hospitals in Gaza](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/gaza/)
.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, International Medical Corps said that it has received about $68 million from the US Agency for International Development for Gaza operations since October 7, 2023, the day of Hamas’ major attack on Israel. And the president himself told an even more dramatic version of the story in a speech on Wednesday, saying that “we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

But there are at least five big reasons to be skeptical that the story is true.

**The White House offered no evidence for the story**: Leavitt provided no proof for her claim that there was ever a federal plan to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza. This was “a small order of injectables and progestin-only contraceptive pills” totaling about $46,000.

**Total worldwide USAID condom spending is far less than $50 million**: In the 2023 fiscal year, USAID provided or funded a global total of about $7.1 million worth of male condoms and about $1.1 million worth of female condoms, overwhelmingly to countries in Africa, according to the federal report.

In other words, Leavitt was essentially claiming Tuesday that the Biden administration had decided to provide more than six times the 2023 worldwide value of condoms to a single tiny territory that has [about 2.1 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html)
 and that is in a region that usually does not receive condoms from the US.

A former senior Biden official who worked on Gaza aid issues told CNN that Leavitt’s story about a $50 million condom expenditure for Gaza was “imaginary.” The former official said: “It’s a lie, they are making s\*\*\* up.”

**The State Department would not repeat Leavitt’s claim**: The White House official pointed to a series of social media posts from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who listed specific examples of how Trump’s aid pause had prevented what Bruce called unjustified spending that wouldn’t make the country “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

But Bruce did not mention $50 million for condoms in Gaza.

Instead, Bruce was vague about how much condom spending was supposedly stopped. While International Medical Corps has [publicly discussed](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story/youre-pregnant-in-gaza-what-happens-next/)
 its reproductive and sexual health services in Gaza, among various other services from cardiology to orthopedics, the organization said in the Wednesday statement that “no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

The organization said the US funding has paid for the two hospitals’ “lifesaving medical care” for roughly 33,000 civilians per month. Like Bruce’s Tuesday social media posts and email to reporters, this Wednesday statement did not repeat Leavitt’s claim that there was $50 million in planned funding for condoms in particular; it provided no dollar figure at all for condoms.

**Experts expressed doubt about Leavitt’s story — or simply called it wrong**: Experts on US aid to Gaza and global health aid were baffled by the claim that the US had been planning to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza.

“We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” said Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, an aid nonprofit that has partnered with USAID on a [five-year, $50 million health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
.

Fake said this Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms” and added: “Our whole program is $50 (million) and represents a significant portion of total US aid going to Gaza.”

[Matthew Kavanagh](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/experts/matthew-m-kavanagh/)
, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said that after doing some digging into Leavitt’s claim, “It seems clear to me there was no $50 million in condoms going to Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Fact check: $50 million for condoms in Gaza? [She wrote](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
: “Example 1: Condoms. Trump’s freeze, the organization said, halts US funding for hospital services like performing about 30 lifesaving surgeries per day, delivering about 20 babies per day, running an emergency room receiving up to 200 patients per day, and operating one of Gaza’s only neonatal intensive care units and only stabilization centers for severely malnourished children.

“If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,” the organization said.

A State Department official issued an additional statement to CNN on Wednesday that asserted that the funding Trump had stopped from going to the International Medical Corps “included” funds for family planning, emergency contraceptives and prevention of sexually transmitted infections."

[During a signing ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/GbnTNGLkJOY?si=pizzIkGXX2OapqI8&t=329)
 Wednesday for the Laken Riley Act, President Donald Trump claimed that his administration had “identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, made a similar claim on Tuesday [during her debut press briefing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xJOgsQQYDY4?si=3oOdJGmBk9r925UL&t=1110)
, stating that the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Management and Budget “found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.” She called the alleged aid “a preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” But there’s no credible evidence to support these claims.

Here’s a closer look at the facts:

CLAIM: The Trump administration stopped $50 million from being sent to the Gaza Strip to buy condoms for Hamas.

THE FACTS: Trump and his spokesperson appeared to be referring to a grant or grants that USAID awarded to a group called the International Medical Corps worth $102.2 million to provide medical and trauma services in Gaza. The State Department earlier Wednesday described this as an example of “egregious funding” not aligned with American interests or the president’s policies.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce similarly [wrote Tuesday](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
 on X that the agency had “prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception” thanks to a [pause in foreign assistance](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884403944719626282)

Officials said the Trump administration stopped two $50 million buckets of “aid” for Gaza via the International Medical Corps, which included: family planning programming including emergency contraception; sexual healthcare including prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs); and adolescent sexual and reproductive health.

The $100 million for these programs included contraceptives, officials said, adding that condoms have traditionally always been used for family planning in developing countries by USAID.

According to the IMC, “No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms, nor provide family-planning services.”

FACT FOCUS: No evidence that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas

FACT FOCUS: No evidence that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ![President Donald Trump speaks before signing the Laken Riley Act in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Jan. They said the resources were used to operate two large field hospitals currently located in central Gaza—one in Deir Al Balah and one in Al Zawaida — offering a combined total capacity of more than 250 beds, including 20 in the emergency room and 170 in the surgical department. According to statistics provided by the IMC, they also assisted in the delivery of some 5,000 babies, screened 111,000 people for malnutrition, treated 2,767 for acute malnutrition and distributed micronutrient supplements to 36,000 people.

Refugees International President Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw USAID’s COVID-19 assistance portfolio for the Biden administration, [refuted Trump and Leavitt’s claims](https://x.com/JeremyKonyndyk/status/1884669087374004430)
 Wednesday on X.

“USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece,” he wrote."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Associated Press published an article stating that there is no evidence to support the claim that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas. The article mentions that the Trump administration stopped two $50 million buckets of “aid” for Gaza via the International Medical Corps, which included family planning programming, but the IMC stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms. The article also mentions that USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece.

Content: "But why are we doing that?" he said.

His comments followed claims by US President Donald Trump, who earlier this month alleged that his administration had “identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

The claim was first announced by White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt in her first press briefing, saying the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had found “that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.” However, the administration provided no evidence to support the assertion.

A review of publicly available USAID data from 2007 to 2023 contradicts the claim, showing no record of condom shipments to Gaza. [World](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world)

**WASHINGTON**

Billionaire Elon Musk backtracked Tuesday on his claim that the US had been intending to send $50 million worth of condoms to the Gaza Strip.

“First of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” Musk told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about fact-checking reports that million of dollars were actually earmarked towards the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in Gaza province of Mozambique.

“We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes," he said.

"I’m not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere. And that is really an enormous number of condoms," Musk continued.

"If it went to Mozambique instead of Gaza…okay, that's not as bad. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

The article also mentions that USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece.

A review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Both CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)) found no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East during the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Elon Musk, who was associated with the claim, retracted it. A review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148)).


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including CNN and the Associated Press, found no evidence to support the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim, and USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was removed from an African Union session on the Rwandan genocide after several African countries objected to his presence, reviving diplomatic tensions over Israel’s observer status.

[\- World news -](/en/service/1194/world)

Avraham Neguise was expelled from Mandela Hall at the African Union headquarters on Monday.

The removal occurred during an annual session focused on the Rwandan genocide.

According to Al Jazeera, the ambassador's participation was not anticipated, and several African delegations objected to his presence.

Diplomatic sources said the meeting was paused until Neguise left the room.

The African Union has reportedly launched an investigation to determine who authorized the Israeli ambassador's attendance.

Since the formation of the African Union in 2002, 87 non-African countries have been granted observer status, which allows them to attend meetings and engage in discussions without voting rights.

The first organization to be granted observer status was the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973, which continues to receive broad support from African member states.

Israel gained observer status in 2021 in an effort to counter Palestinian influence within the bloc.

However, its status was later rescinded following objections from several African countries, which argued that Israel had violated the AU Charter due to its ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories.

This marks the second time an Israeli diplomat has been ejected from an AU meeting.

In February 2023, an Israeli delegation was removed from the opening ceremony of the AU summit in Addis Ababa.

The Israeli foreign ministry blamed South Africa and Algeria for what it described as a severe diplomatic breach.

According to the Israeli news site Walla, security personnel escorted the Israeli delegates out during the event.

AU member states have consistently opposed Israel’s participation, citing the ongoing war in Gaza and the genocide against the Palestinian people.

Although Israel regained observer status in 2021, Algerian diplomats moved to revoke it in January 2022.

The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, [Avraham Neguise](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)
, was reportedly expelled from an annual conference on the Rwandan genocide held in the Mandela Hall at the African Union’s headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on Monday, April 7.

Neguise was expelled after several delegations of different African countries objected to his participation in the conference, which was paused until he left the hall. 

!Israeli diplomat booted from AU conference <image:5962>

Ethiopian-born Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia expelled from AU session, Avraham Neguise. As his participation was unexpected, the African Union is reportedly conducting an [investigation](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-african-union-headquarters/)
 to detect who invited him. Neguise served as a member of the Knesset with the far-right Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from 2015 to 2019.

The expulsion of the senior Israeli diplomat is seen as part of a wider protest by many African countries against Israel’s genocidal aggression on the besieged Gaza strip, which has continued for over a year and a half, and claimed the lives of over [50,800 Palestinians](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/mid-east/israel-kills-58-more-palestinians-as-gaza-death-toll-tops-50800)
, according to official estimates from Gaza’s Ministry of Health.

It is worth noting that the African Union joined a case filed in the International Court of Justice ([ICJ](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250407-israel-envoy-expelled-from-au-meeting/)
) by South Africa against Israel’s genocide in Gaza in February 2025.

### **Israel condemned the expulsion of Neguise**

Unabashed by his government’s continuous massacres against Palestinians, the spokesperson of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, [Oren Marmorstein](https://themedialine.org/headlines/israel-condemns-expulsion-of-ambassador-from-african-union-genocide-event/)
, condemned the action taken by the African Union against Neguise calling it a distortion of history, which “harms the memory of the murdered.”

“It is outrageous that, at an event commemorating the victims of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, to which the Israeli ambassador in Addis Ababa was invited, the chairman of the African Union Commission from Djibouti chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements,” Marmorstein stated.

### **Israel’s international isolation grows as the genocide continues in Gaza**

As Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues unrelenting, more countries are demonstrating their condemnation of its war crimes through diplomatic, political, economic, and legal actions.

One day after the African Union expelled the Israeli ambassador from the conference, the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister, [Caspar Veldkamp](https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/dutch-foreign-minister-summons-israeli-ambassador-over-gaza)
, summoned the Israeli ambassador in the Netherlands over the situation in Gaza.

The move came after the Netherlands [announced](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/dutch-government-tightens-military-export-restrictions-to-israel-316048)
 on Monday “a significant tightening of restrictions on the export of military and dual-use goods to Israel” over the situation in the besieged enclave.

Content: "!Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia expelled from African Union headquarters despite invite <image:5973>

[(The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-849210)
)- Israel’s ambassador to Ethiopia was expelled from the African Union headquarters after member states refused to participate in an annual meeting, the Israeli Foreign Ministry confirmed on Monday.

Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein commented, “It is outrageous that, specifically at an event commemorating the victims of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, to which the Israeli ambassador in Addis Ababa was invited, the Chairman of the African Union Commission from Djibouti chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements.”

“This unacceptable conduct harms the memory of the victims first and foremost and reflects a lack of basic understanding of the history of both the Rwandan people and the Jewish people,” Marmorstein added.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will take the necessary diplomatic steps with the relevant parties to make clear the gravity with which we view this event,” he concluded.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025. The conference was held at the African Union headquarters. The sources do not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador, but rather that he was removed from the conference.

The African Union joined a case against Israel in February 2025, which may have influenced the decision to remove the ambassador. The Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the action.

Therefore, while the evidence confirms the ambassador's removal from a conference in Addis Ababa, it does not explicitly confirm that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.

*   Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. 
*   Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.   
    
*   Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.   
    
*   Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

On 26 May 2016, the IHRA Plenary adopted its [Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
, which declares: 

“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” 

The definition of antisemitism was originally drafted with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which worked with several prominent Jewish organizations to draft a comprehensive definition of antisemitism. However, in 2009 EUMC was replaced by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which decided that it would not provide a definition to any form of prejudice, including antisemitism. 

Explaining the decision, then-IHRA Chair, Romanian Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, [stated](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/AntiSemitism/Pages/The-IHRA-adopts-working-definition-of-antiemitism-2-June-2016.aspx)
, “All IHRA Member Countries share the concern that incidents of antisemitism are steadily rising and agree that the IHRA’s Member Countries and indeed the IHRA’s experts need political tools with which to fight this scourge. The IHRA’s 31 member countries -- 24 of which are EU member countries -- are committed to the Stockholm Declaration and thereby to fighting the evil of antisemitism through coordinated international political action.” 

The definition includes a list of eleven reference [examples](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
 to aid the identification of antisemitism. Universities, municipalities, religious groups and even sports clubs are among the bodies that have formally adopted the definition thus far. 

The UN Member States that have formally endorsed or adopted IHRA Working definition of antisemitism include:

!Ihra countries <image:5984>

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also been a strong advocate for adopting a universal definition of antisemitism, saying, “Such a definition can serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.”

#### IHRA and Roma Genocide Remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance) Some critics of the definition have claimed that by including within its examples references to Israel, it unfairly labels detractors of Israeli policy as antisemites. Defenders of the definition argue that the wording leaves room for vigorous criticism of Israel’s government as it states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” and that it is a non-legally binding definition, intended to guide and educate without limiting debate or free speech."

**Antisemitic acts are criminal** when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

**Criminal acts are antisemitic** when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.

**Antisemitic discrimination** is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

! By doing so, the IHRA provided an important practical tool for its Member Countries.

What has its impact been?

The working definition of antisemitism has brought the issue once more to the attention of leaders around the world, making them aware that much work still needs to be done to address antisemitism, which is deeply rooted in our societies.

As a result, countries and organizations have developed national and regional strategies to counter antisemitism, and have appointed Special Envoys and other advisors on the issue. [Skip to main content](#main)

In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.

On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:

> **Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:**
> 
> **“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. <image:5991>

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why was the IHRA working definition of antisemitism developed?

The IHRA is the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues. Following the example of the working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion (2013), the IHRA’s experts set out to adopt a similar tool to help guide the organization’s work on combating antisemitism.

How did the IHRA adopt the working definition of antisemitism?

The experts in the IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial built international consensus around a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which was then adopted by the Plenary, the IHRA’s decision-making body made up of representatives from all IHRA Member Countries. This practical tool has also been formally adopted or endorsed\* by these groups, both at the national and organizational level.

*   [Secretary General Antonio Guterres](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sgsm19252.doc.htm)
     acknowledged the efforts of the IHRA Member Countries to agree on a common definition of antisemitism and underlined that it could serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.
*   [Special Rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/ActionPlanChanges-May2022.pdf)
     recommended that governments use the IHRA working definition of antisemitism as a non-legally binding educational and training tool and ensure it is incorporated, together with relevant human rights standards-based guidance on protecting freedom of opinion and expression, into training and educational materials for all public officials, such as police, prosecutors, and judges, government employees, educators, and national human rights institutions, and integrated into diversity inclusion programs.

### European Union

*   [Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/06/fight-against-antisemitism-council-declaration/)
     and [Parliament](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2017-0243&language=EN&ring=B8-2017-0383)
     called on Member States that had not done so already to endorse the non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism employed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as a useful guidance tool in education and training, including for law enforcement authorities in their efforts to identify and investigate antisemitic attacks more efficiently and effectively.
*   Commission highlighted the working definition of antisemitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as the benchmark for developing a victim-centered approach and urged for its adoption.

### Organization of American States

*   Secretary General Luis Almagro asked every member state to adopt the working definition and announced it would be employed to guide OAS work.

### Council of Europe

*   [European Commission against Racism and Intolerance](https://rm.coe.int/opinion-ecri-on-ihra-wd-on-antisemitism-2755-7610-7522-1/1680a091dd)
     welcomed the non-legally binding IHRA working definition of antisemitism in the sense that it aids and promotes a better understanding of antisemitism."

#### Europe

In late 2016, [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia")
 blocked the [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe")
's adoption of the IHRA-WDA.[\[123\]](#cite_note-127)
 The European Parliament called for member states to adopt the IHRA-WDA on 1 June 2017[\[124\]](#cite_note-128)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-Factsheet-125)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-129)
 – although Lerman notes that this is without explicitly quoting the examples.[\[94\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELerman2018b-98)

##### United Kingdom

In March 2016, [Eric Pickles](/wiki/Eric_Pickles "Eric Pickles")
, then [Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Communities_and_Local_Government "Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government")
, recommended the EUMC working definition of antisemitism, as used by the UK's [College of Policing](/wiki/College_of_Policing "College of Policing")
.[\[126\]](#cite_note-130)
 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons [Home Affairs Select Committee](/wiki/Home_Affairs_Select_Committee "Home Affairs Select Committee")
 published a report on antisemitism in the UK, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the IHRA-WDA as "helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose", as well as some of the criticisms of the definition. [Pro-Israel](/wiki/Pro-Israel "Pro-Israel")
 organizations have been advocates for the worldwide legal adoption of the IHRA working definition.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Penslar_2022_pp._133–145-12)

It has been described as an example of a [persuasive definition](/wiki/Persuasive_definition "Persuasive definition")
, and as a "prime example of language being both the site of, and stake in, struggles for power".[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The examples relating to Israel have been criticised by academics, including legal scholars, who say that they are often used to [weaponize antisemitism](/wiki/Weaponization_of_antisemitism "Weaponization of antisemitism")
 in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. Marcus writes that the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism used by the EUMC was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness".[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-30)
 The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-154-31)

Following the EUMC report, the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe")
 (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post-[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights](/wiki/Office_for_Democratic_Institutions_and_Human_Rights "Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights")
 (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 According to Marcus, the EUMC scrapped this failed definition of antisemitism, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations.[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015160-33)

### 2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version

Israeli scholar [Dina Porat](/wiki/Dina_Porat "Dina Porat")
, then head of the [Stephen Roth Institute](/wiki/Stephen_Roth_Institute "Stephen Roth Institute")
 at [Tel Aviv University](/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University "Tel Aviv University")
, proposed the idea for a common definition of antisemitism during an NGO conference organized by the [American Jewish Committee](/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee "American Jewish Committee")
 (AJC).[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 [Kenneth S. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding.[\[34\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161-38)

EUMC publication
----------------

### Initial publication

At the suggestion of the AJC, the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 The consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [European Jewish Congress](/wiki/European_Jewish_Congress "European Jewish Congress")
, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.[\[22\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010a-26)
 The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 According to Michael Whine of the [Community Security Trust](/wiki/Community_Security_Trust "Community Security Trust")
, the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism "played an active role in formulating the Working Definition".[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010-40)

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")
 on its website that shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)
 Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".[\[8\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015166–167-9)
 Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership, and "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained".[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)

The stated purpose of the working definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism".[\[38\]](#cite_note-definition-42)
 It said:

> Antisemitism is a certain perception of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews")
> , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."[\[95\]](#cite_note-workdef-99)
 After "taking into account the overall context", the examples of what might constitute antisemitism include claims of [Jewish dual loyalty](/wiki/Antisemitic_tropes#Dual_loyalty "Antisemitic tropes")
,[\[96\]](#cite_note-100)
 and "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor".[\[97\]](#cite_note-101)

### Adoption

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism in the party, leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)
[\[147\]](#cite_note-Jewish_Chronicle-151)
 The UK Delegation to the IHRA said that modifying the IHRA-WDA or not including all 11 examples would mean it "is no longer the IHRA definition", would remove the consistency of having a single definition, and "undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist".[\[154\]](#cite_note-158)

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 unamended examples to the definition of antisemitism; the IHRA-WDA was subsequently added to the party's standing orders by a majority vote of 205 by the [Parliamentary Labour Party](/wiki/Parliamentary_Labour_Party "Parliamentary Labour Party")
.[\[145\]](#cite_note-SabSep18-149)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-159)

Later in the month, a report by the [Media Reform Coalition](/w/index.php?title=Media_Reform_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Reform Coalition (page does not exist)")
 examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. While the announcement was welcomed by Zionist advocacy groups including [AIJAC](/wiki/AIJAC "AIJAC")
 (the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council) and the [Zionist Federation of Australia](/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Australia "Zionist Federation of Australia")
, the [New Israel Fund](/wiki/New_Israel_Fund "New Israel Fund")
 Australia and Australia Palestine Advocacy Network expressed concerns that the IHRA definition could be used to silence criticism of Israeli policies and actions.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Australia_2021-114)

On 10 July 2025, the first report of Australia's [Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism](/wiki/List_of_combating_antisemitism_envoys#Australia "List of combating antisemitism envoys")
[\[171\]](#cite_note-175)
[\[172\]](#cite_note-176)
 urged adoption of the IHRA working definition and its examples throughout Australian government and society "as best practice for identifying antisemitism". The report was welcomed by some Jewish organizations but criticized by others.[\[173\]](#cite_note-177)
[\[174\]](#cite_note-178)
 It was criticized in several quarters for a chilling of free speech particularly as to Israeli government policies, and a [Trumpian](/wiki/Trumpism "Trumpism")
 threat to the independence of universities and arts organisations.[\[175\]](#cite_note-179)
[\[176\]](#cite_note-180)
[\[177\]](#cite_note-181)
[\[178\]](#cite_note-182)
 Kenneth Stern, the definition's lead drafter, said that it would be a "disaster" for Australia to adopt the proposal to deal with antisemitism mainly by restricting speech.[\[179\]](#cite_note-183)
 The federal government has said that it will respond to the report after receiving a report from the special envoy on islamophobia, due in August, and a final report on racism in universities from the [Australian Human Rights Commission](/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission")
, due in October.[\[180\]](#cite_note-184)

##### New Zealand

On 24 June 2022, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")
 formally became an observer of the IHRA.[\[181\]](#cite_note-185)
 The announcement was welcomed by the [New Zealand Jewish Council](/wiki/New_Zealand_Jewish_Council "New Zealand Jewish Council")
 and the [Holocaust Centre of New Zealand](/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_Centre_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holocaust Centre of New Zealand (page does not exist)")
 as a means of combating racism and antisemitism. In recent years, criticism of the definition has grown with critics arguing that it "primarily targets criticism of Israel and that it has been weaponized against Palestinian activists".[\[195\]](#cite_note-199)

In a statement published on 3 November 2022, 128 scholars, including leading Jewish academics at Israeli, European, United Kingdom and United States universities, said the definition has been "hijacked" and urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition due to its "divisive and polarising" effect.[\[196\]](#cite_note-200)
[\[197\]](#cite_note-201)
 As of 20 April 2023, 104 human and civil rights organisations, including [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
 and the ACLU, also urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition saying in a letter that "The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe."[\[198\]](#cite_note-202)
[\[199\]](#cite_note-203)

Criticism of the examples
-------------------------

### Academic

In March 2005, [Brian Klug](/wiki/Brian_Klug "Brian Klug")
 argued that the definition's examples proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [criticism of Israel](/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel")
, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.[\[200\]](#cite_note-204)

In December 2016, [David Feldman](/wiki/David_Feldman_(historian) "David Feldman (historian)")
 wrote: "I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He also said: "The text also carries dangers. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."[\[203\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlug2018b-207)

In August 2018, [Rebecca Ruth Gould](/wiki/Rebecca_Ruth_Gould "Rebecca Ruth Gould")
, Professor of Islamic world and comparative literature at the [University of Birmingham](/wiki/University_of_Birmingham "University of Birmingham")
, published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: "Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech" in the journal _[Law, Culture and the Humanities](/wiki/Law,_Culture_and_the_Humanities "Law, Culture and the Humanities")
_."

Content: "Together, these definitions and others demonstrate the many ways antisemitic ideas are used to foment hatred and division.

#### The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism

The IHRA is an intergovernmental agency of 35 member and nine observer countries committed to Holocaust education, remembrance, and research. State Department began using it in 2010, referring to it as the "State Department's working definition of antisemitism." The IHRA formally adopted it in 2016.

As of August 2024, the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism had been adopted by 35 states and the District of Columbia. With this knowledge in mind, it's important to note that the words "working definition" connote the possibility for change.

The IHRA definition is recognized as authoritative and used widely by governments and institutions worldwide because it was the first of its kind, is succinct, was written and approved by an international body, and was devised as a tool for education.

The definition states:

> "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Critics of the definition suggest they do not allow for legitimate criticism of Israel, its leaders, or its actions.

Read the full text of the [IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
.

#### The Nexus Document

The Nexus Task Force is comprised of academics and clergy-including URJ professional leaders and philanthropic leaders - who came together to study the intersection (or nexus) of antisemitism, Israel, Zionism, and American politics. By codifying specific wording, we leave no space for nuance or personal understanding, hallmarks of Reform Jewish thought.

Here are five definitions of antisemitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), the Nexus Taskforce, the Jerusalem Declaration, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The document suggests that it is not antisemitic to criticize Israel's current policies or the policies which led to the creation of the modern State, and that it is not inherently antisemitic to pay disproportionate attention to Israel.

Read the full text of the [Nexus Document](https://nexusproject.us/nexus-resources/the-nexus-document/)
.

#### The Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism

The Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) was written in response to the IHRA definition. As you continue to challenge antisemitism in all of its forms, we encourage you to consult any or all of the definitions shared here for guidance.

As antisemitism continues to threaten American democracy, many people - and institutions - are looking for a concise, objective definition to use in online exchanges, schools, and universities to decide if a derisive comment or chanted epithet is legally actionable.

Why is a definition needed? The group published a white paper - a document used to succinctly analyze a challenge and present solutions - in late 2020.

This definition of antisemitism was derived from the white paper.

> Antisemitism consists of anti-Jewish beliefs, attitudes, actions, or systemic conditions. JDA takes its name from the location of its sponsoring institution, the Van Leer Institute, a humanities and social science think tank.

The JDA is intended to serve as an alternative to the IHRA definition and its examples."

“It’s a message that they want to make an example out of me, even if you are a legal resident… that we will find a way to come after you, to punish you, if you speak, against what we want.”

Khalil told the Associated Press that if his claim against the Trump administration is successful, he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in Trump’s “failed” effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech. CNN has previously reported that the ICE agents [did not have a warrant](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-news-update)
 during Khalil’s arrest.

Khalil was among the first in a series of high-profile arrests of pro-Palestinian students as US President Donald Trump’s administration moved to crack down on antisemitism on college campuses. [](#maincontent)

Mahmoud Khalil describes conditions at ICE detention facility

01:24

CNN  — 

Detained for more than 100 days without charge, and with the threat of deportation looming over him, Palestinian student activist [Mahmoud Khalil](https://cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 was convinced he would eventually prevail.

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Khalil, who is now back with his young family, describes the months languishing in a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, and the pain of being denied permission to be present at his son’s birth.

“It was a very, very dehumanizing experience, for someone who was not accused of any crime, whatsoever,” said Khalil, a green card holder who had no formal criminal or civil charges brought against him.

His detention sparked outrage across the US.

On Thursday Khalil’s lawyers [filed a claim](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 against the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned, prosecuted and portrayed as antisemitic as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The 30-year-old, who was born in a refugee camp in Syria before going on to graduate from Columbia, had played a prominent role negotiating on behalf of pro-Palestinian protesters at the university.

Once taken, he was moved first to New Jersey, then to Texas, and finally to an ICE detention center in Louisiana – more than 1,000 miles away from his wife, a US citizen, who was then eight months pregnant.

“I was literally moved from one place to another, like an object,” he recalled, referring to his [transfers](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/us/mahmoud-khalil-palestinian-activist-trump)
 to different detention facilities. “I was shackled all the time,” he said.

But, he said, the days in the detention center never broke his spirit.

“From the moment that I was detained, I knew that I would eventually prevail,” he said.

“What I simply did is protesting a genocide.”

Israel has repeatedly pushed back against claims its war in Gaza is a genocide.

The food in the ICE center in Louisiana was nearly “inedible,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security in a statement called Khalil’s claim “absurd.”

His arrest outside his apartment on Columbia University’s campus in New York City in March, as he returned home from a dinner with his wife, felt like a “kidnap,” he told Amanpour.

Plainclothes agents had followed him into the lobby of his building, and threatened his wife with arrest if she didn’t separate from him, he said. His lawyers have vehemently pushed back on that assertion.

After accusing him – without evidence – of being a Hamas sympathizer, the Trump administration, who sought Khalil’s [deportation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/index.html)
, said it was [justified](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-green-card-trump-administration)
 because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident. After being served meat that made him vomit, he switched to vegetarian options, he said.

The center was bitterly cold, but repeated requests for blankets were ignored, he said.

“The moment you enter such ICE facilities, your rights literally stay outside,” he told Amanpour.

CNN has previously reached out to ICE for comment about the conditions at its Louisiana facilities – its policies indicate detention is non-punitive. The GEO Group, the corporation that runs the facility where Khalil was held, has denied allegations of abuse.

The Trump administration has argued that Khalil’s actions pose a threat to its foreign policy goal of combatting antisemitism. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration’s deportation policies.

‘I couldn’t hold him’
---------------------

Amid the inedible food, the cold, and fear he might be deported, one moment stood out as the hardest to bear – immigration officials denying him permission to be present at the birth of his firstborn child.

Attorneys for Khalil in May said officials at the Louisiana center cited a “blanket no-contact visitation policy” and unspecified security concerns as part of their reason to deny the request.

“Missing the birth of my child."

Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?
==========================================================================

20 June 2025

Phil McCauslandBBC News, New York

! On 20 June, a judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released.

Born in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of "un-American activity".

Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. They accused the government of "open repression of student activism and political speech".

Mr Khalil's arrest was the highest-profile in Trump's crackdown on international student protesters, as video of his arrest whipped around social media and the birth of his first child in April, which he was still detained, made international headlines.

Khalil's work for UK in Middle East
-----------------------------------

Born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor.

More recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.

The UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago.

Mr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. <image:6295>!Getty Images Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil talks to the press during the press briefing organized by Pro-Palestinian protesters who set up a new encampment at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus <image:6298>Getty Images

Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. <image:6295>!Getty Images A protester in New York City with green hair and sunglasses holds up a sign that reads: "RELEASE MAHMOUD" <image:6296>Getty Images

Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.

The case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.

Mr Khalil was held in an immigration facility in Louisiana for three months before a federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump could no longer detain or deport him. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".

The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.

Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.

After Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of "leading activities aligned to Hamas" but did not provide further details.

The White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.

Legal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.

"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration," said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.

Khalil had been briefly suspended from Columbia
-----------------------------------------------

Watch: The BBC speaks to Columbia student after suspension

Amid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.

At the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.

It is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.

"\[They said\] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me)," he said in an interview in early May. From then until mid-June he was held by immigration authorities on two charges.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue Mr Khalil's presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences".

In early June, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz [ruled Rubio's justification for detaining](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd28em88ezo)
 Mr Khalil was likely unconstitutional and said the US government could not detain or deport a legal US resident under that reasoning.

Attorneys for the Trump administration then said Mr Khalil was being held for a different reason, failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024.

But on 20 June, Judge Farbiarz ordered him to be released on bail.

The White House maintains the judge did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release and said they plan to appeal.

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

An X account of visegrad24 made a [post](https://x.com/visegrad24/status/1858887085094056012)
 citing The World Factbook claiming that

> Gaza population increased by 2.02% or 43,000 people since October 7th 2023.

(an [archived](https://archive.md/hq9B0)
 version if the site doesn't work). It links to this [PDF](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_WPD2024E.pdf)

 does.

I then decided to look for another source, and I found on the [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza)

> Gaza has grown by 22,449 in the last year, which represents a 2.88% annual change.

I finally continued to a [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)
 article where they claim

> The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Which sources are more reliable and what can be concluded regarding if the population in Gaza since October 7th 2023 or since January 1st 2024 until December 31st 2024 has increased or decreased?

    Maybe the best conclusion is: It's a war zone, nobody did an exact census, therefore nobody knows exactly. I would have thought a skeptical question would be more like "This source from October 2024 claims that Gaza's population has increased since 2023, despite the recent events."

While reliable sources are difficult to find, due to the ongoing war, the assertion that the population of Gaza increased since the Hamas attacks against Israel and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza is highly implausible based on the sources available.

First, what have been the negative contributions to the population of Gaza since then?

**Deaths**: The [United Nations reported around 45,000 people killed as of December of 2024,](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-10-december-2024)
 basing its figures on data from the Gaza Ministry of Health in that same month. There were 58270 in the Gaza Strip in 2021 according to PA'sinterior ministry : [pcbs.gov.ps/…](https://pcbs.gov.ps/statisticsIndicatorsTables.aspx?lang=en&table_id=1568)
     In the first 3 months of the war, nearly 20,000 babies have been born in Gaza according to Unicef : [timesofisrael.com/liveblog\_entry/…](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/nearly-20000-babies-born-in-gaza-hell-since-oct-7-says-un-official-mum-on-israeli-baby-hostage/)
     (it might be slightly more than usual due to a higher rate of preterm births [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_Gaza_Strip_preterm_births)

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported on the Palestinian population in July 2024.

They [reported](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=5791)

> 5.61 million Palestinians in the State of Palestine (2.85 million males and 2.76 million females)

They report on 39 thousand Palestinians killed, several thousand that left, and people at risk of malnutrition and lack of medical treatment.

They predict:

> Based on the data, the estimated growth rate in Gaza Strip for 2023 will decrease from about 2.7%, according to PCBS estimates for 2023, **to only about 1% during 2024**. It probably isn't even possible to conduct a census.

    The _World Population Review_ link you posted cites a _single source_ for its data, which is titled "Localities in Gaza Governorate by type of locality and population estimates - 2007-2016". Which would work well if nothing significant happened between 2016 and now … but that's obviously not the case.

*   Is this a _skeptical_ question, or just a question about Gaza's population, when there are conflicting sources? It is also reasonable to speculate that these figures are an underestimate, given the difficulty of confirming deaths and the likelihood of additional deaths due to secondary effects of the conflict, but for the sake of making a conservative estimate, we will limit ourselves to these numbers.

**Emigration**: [News reports suggest at least 100,000 Gazans sought refuge in Egypt](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20241007-a-year-of-war-in-gaza-100-000-palestinians-fled-to-egypt)
 before Israel took control of the Rafah border crossing.

What about positive contributions to the population?

**Births**: The [CIA Factbook suggests a population of around 2 million and a growth rate of around 2.13% in years before the war](https://web.archive.org/web/20210112082940/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip/)
. With the war making it even less popular and Israel having taken control of all crossings as of May 2024, it seems likely that essentially no one is permanently moving to Gaza.

In short, based on publicly available information, the negative contributions to the population of Gaza since the beginning of the war are likely to exceed 145,000, while the positive contributions are likely around 43,000."

**RAMALLAH, Palestine / ISTANBUL**

Gaza’s population has dropped by 10% as Israel continued its destructive war on the Palestinian enclave, official figures showed on Thursday.

“Palestine, specifically the Gaza Strip, is suffering an unprecedented humanitarian and demographic catastrophe due to the ongoing Israeli aggression since October 2023,” the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.

The bureau said that more than 57,000 Palestinians, including 18,000 children and 12,000 women, were killed in Israeli attacks, which constitutes 2.4% of Gaza’s total population.

Figures released by the bureau also showed that nearly 100,000 Palestinians have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.

Before the outbreak of the Israeli war, Gaza's population stood at 2,226,544 in 2023, as official figures showed.

“Population estimates indicate that the population has declined to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to the projection of mid-2024 estimates,” it said.

“Furthermore, the population dropped to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from what was estimated for mid-2025.”

The bureau warned of “a fundamental shift” and distortion in the age and population pyramid “due to the deliberate targeting of younger age groups by the Israeli army, particularly children and youth.”

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023."

## Actions
```
web_search("Gaza population increase since October 7 2023")
web_search("Gaza population statistics October 2023")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (<image:6350>). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since October 2023. <image:k> The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the population decreased to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to mid-2024 estimates, and to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from mid-2025 estimates. The article also mentions that over 57,000 Palestinians were killed and nearly 100,000 have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics says Gaza's population has declined by around 160,000, including over 55,000 presumed dead and 100,000 people that have left Gaza since 7 October, 2023.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) estimates that Gaza's population has fallen by about 6% since the start of Israel's war on the enclave.

Israel’s air and ground offensive has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. About 100,00 Palestinians that left Gaza since 7 October, 2023, it adds.

As such, the PCBS says Gaza's population has [**declined**](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/site/512/default.aspx?tabID=512&lang=en&ItemID=5901&mid=3171&wversion=Staging)
 by around 160,000 to 2.1 million. As of July 2024, OCHA [**estimates**](https://www.unocha.org/publications/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/humanitarian-situation-update-224-gaza-strip-enarhe#:~:text=As%20of%20July%202024%2C%20the,now%20used%20for%20programmatic%20purposes.))
 that about 2.1 million people remain in the Gaza Strip.

"There are catastrophic human and material losses," the PCBS wrote, "yet this aggressive, brutal Israeli aggression against all of Gaza Strip continues."

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the UN's top court based in The Hague, ruled last January that Israel must prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians.

HRW and Amnesty International accuse Israel of "acts of genocide"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple human rights organisations have accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza because of the scale of death and destruction.

In December, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that by systematically restricting and targeting Gaza’s water supply forms a campaign that amounts to “acts of genocide.”

It was the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. It claimed Israel has worked to facilitate the flow of water and humanitarian aid into Gaza throughout the war.

In its report, HRW alleged that countless infants, children and adults have died from malnutrition, dehydration and illness as a result of actions by Israeli authorities over more than a year of war to deliberately cut the flow of water and electricity to Gaza, destroy infrastructure and prevent the distribution of critical supplies.

“As a state policy, these acts constitute a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population. Under international law, proving intent is key in concluding whether the crime of genocide has been committed.

When the ICJ issued its orders that Israel provide Palestinians with basic services and assistance, officials ignored them, the group alleged.

Human Rights Watch said its findings were based on interviews with more than 60 Palestinians, accounts from utility employees, doctors and other healthcare workers and aid workers, and analysis of satellite images, photos and video.

“Doctors and nurses told Human Rights Watch that they had seen numerous infants, children, and adults die from a combination of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease,” the group said.

HRW's report came two weeks after Amnesty International accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel dismissed the allegation as as “entirely false and based on lies.” Israel has previously refuted charges lodged by South Africa in the International Court of Justice that its forces have carried out inhumane acts in the embattled enclave.

Meanwhile, the International Criminal Court is seeking the arrests of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for allegedly committing war crimes.

[](#) While Israel's foreign ministry says this number is fabricated, it matches the estimate made by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.

“Human Rights Watch is once more spreading its blood libels in order to promote its anti-Israel propaganda,” Israel's Foreign Ministry said. Israeli officials are therefore committing the crime against humanity of extermination,” the New York-based group said.

The rights group said that the “pattern of conduct” outlined in its report and statements from Israeli officials “may indicate" genocidal intent, but it did not come down definitively on one side."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (<image:6350>). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023."

## Actions
```
web_search("Gaza population increase since October 7 2023")
web_search("Gaza population statistics October 2023")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (<image:6350>). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

*   [Source](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/57590/has-the-gaza-population-increased-in-2024-and-if-so-by-how-much)


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261): 
Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since October 2023. <image:k> The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the population decreased to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to mid-2024 estimates, and to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from mid-2025 estimates. The article also mentions that over 57,000 Palestinians were killed and nearly 100,000 have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261): 
Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since October 2023. <image:k> The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the population decreased to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to mid-2024 estimates, and to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from mid-2025 estimates. The article also mentions that over 57,000 Palestinians were killed and nearly 100,000 have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

Etymology

This section is an excerpt from [Gaza City § Etymology](/wiki/Gaza_City#Etymology "Gaza City")
.\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_City&action=edit)\
\]

The name _Gaza_ first appears in military records of [Tuthmosis III](/wiki/Tuthmosis_III "Tuthmosis III")
 of [Egypt](/wiki/New_Kingdom_(Egypt) "New Kingdom (Egypt)")
 in the 15th century BC,[\[36\]](#cite_note-40)
\[_[need quotation to verify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")\
_\] and was mentioned in the [Amarna correspondence](/wiki/Amarna_correspondence "Amarna correspondence")
 as _Āl Ĥazzati_ and other variant spellings.[\[37\]](#cite_note-41)
 In [Neo-Assyrian](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian")
 sources, reflecting the late [Philistine](/wiki/Philistine "Philistine")
 period, it was known as _Hāzat_.[\[38\]](#cite_note-42)
 It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city's [modern Hebrew](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew")
 name, _ʻAzzā_, a common [folk etymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology "Folk etymology")
 insists the name stems from the Hebrew root _[ʻayin](/wiki/%CA%BBayin "ʻayin")
_\-_[zayin](/wiki/Zayin "Zayin")
_\-_zayin_, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived,[\[39\]](#cite_note-Gaza_City_Masalha-43)
 but this is unlikely. The owner of a Christian bookshop was abducted and murdered in October 2007.[\[326\]](#cite_note-330)

 Three more were killed when Israel bombed [Holy Family Church](/wiki/Holy_Family_Church,_Gaza "Holy Family Church, Gaza")
 in July 2025.[\[329\]](#cite_note-333)

In addition to Hamas, a [Salafist](/wiki/Salafist "Salafist")
 movement began to appear about 2005 in Gaza, characterized by "a strict lifestyle based on that of the earliest followers of Islam".[\[330\]](#cite_note-bbc-salafist-334)
 As of 2015[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_Strip&action=edit)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (<image:6350>). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since October 2023. <image:k> The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the population decreased to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to mid-2024 estimates, and to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from mid-2025 estimates. The article also mentions that over 57,000 Palestinians were killed and nearly 100,000 have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) estimates that Gaza's population has fallen by about 6% since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, according to a Euronews article published on January 2, 2025. The PCBS estimates the population has declined by around 160,000 to 2.1 million, including over 55,000 presumed dead and 100,000 people that have left Gaza since October 7, 2023. The Wikipedia article "Demographics of Palestine" provides population data for the Gaza Strip, with the CIA World Factbook estimating the population at 2,098,389 in 2023. The PCBS estimated the population in mid-2023 to be 2,226,544. CEIC Data provides PCBS population projections, with the latest figures for Gaza Strip population at 2,106,745.000 in 2021.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is not supported by the evidence. While one source, the NYCFPA, mentions this increase, other sources, including CNN, Anadolu Agency, and the PCBS, report a decrease in population. The PCBS estimates a 6% decrease since the start of the war. The Wikipedia article on the Gaza Strip mentions a 1.99% annual population growth rate in 2023, but also notes the war's impact, including widespread destruction and a humanitarian crisis.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (<image:6350>). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (<image:6373>).

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Oct. 30, 2023, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1**.\[72\] This is the second time that Hezbollah targeted Mossad Headquarters near Tel Aviv in the recent days.\[73\] Hezbollah also reported that it fired a Fadi-4 rocket targeting Unit 8200 headquarters near Tel Aviv for the first time on October 1.\[74\] Unit 8200 is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for signals intelligence and similar activities.\[75\] Hezbollah separately claimed that it fired medium-range rockets targeting Sde Dov Airport, which closed in 2019, near Tel Aviv on October 1.\[76\] Hezbollah said that these attacks are part of “Operation Khaybar,” which is Hezbollah’s response to the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah on September 27.\[77\] The IDF has not commented on either attack at this time.

**Hezbollah continued its attack campaign targeting Israeli civilian and military sites in Israel on October 1.**  Hezbollah conducted a two-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF position in Metula.\[78\] The IDF said that it detected several projectiles over Metula and intercepted some of them.\[79\] Hezbollah also mortared Israeli forces in Avivim on October 1.\[80\] The IDF said that it also identified individual projectiles that fell in open areas in Avivim.\[81\] Hezbollah claimed on October 1 that the latest attack campaign against Israel is in response to Israel’s ”invasion” of Lebanese towns and villages.\[82\]

**Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.\[83\]** The US ambassador to Iraq announced that an attack took place at the Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a US State Department facility.\[84\] The attack occurred hours before the Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting Israel. <image:2136>

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

### Analysis

The IDF stated that they had performed an assessment and concluded that Hezbollah was responsible for the rocket attack.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)
 IDF spokesman [Daniel Hagari](/wiki/Daniel_Hagari "Daniel Hagari")
 stated that the type of rocket used was an Iranian-made Falaq-1,[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
 carrying a 50 kg [warhead](/wiki/Warhead "Warhead")
, which has previously been used by Hezbollah, the only Iranian proxy to possess it.[\[35\]](#cite_note-ynet28july-36)
 The Israeli army posted pictures of Falaq-1 shrapnel that it said was found at the scene of the attack, but with no apparent pictures of the shrapnel in situ at the blast site.[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)

 Iranian and Qatari state media claimed there were reports that an Iron Dome interceptor was to blame.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)

[\[41\]](#cite_note-42)
 Additionally, _[Al-Mayadeen](/wiki/Al-Mayadeen "Al-Mayadeen")
_, a Lebanese outlet with close ties to Hezbollah, stated that the blast site was inconsistent with a Falaq-1, which it said would have left a larger impact crater;[\[36\]](#cite_note-mscac-37)
 subsequent to the report, the Israeli government voted to ban _Al-Mayadeen_ from operating inside Israel.[\[42\]](#cite_note-43)

According to US intelligence, there were no doubts that Hezbollah was responsible but it was not certain if Hezbollah intentionally targeted the site or misfired.[\[29\]](#cite_note-APNews20240728-30)

The _Associated Press_ reported that rocket sirens sounded less than a minute before the explosion, which left a crater 2 meters wide. He stated that while the conflict would come at a significant cost, the goal is to decisively defeat Hezbollah and restore peace, and he has directed the Foreign Ministry to prepare a global campaign to support actions in Lebanon.[\[6\]](#cite_note-Ynetnews20240727-7)

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 27 Sep 202427 Sep 2024

Hezbollah has [confirmed](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
 that its leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/liveblog/2024/9/28/israel-attacks-lebanon-deaths-mount-as-beirut-buildings-bombed-to)
, has been killed in an Israeli air attack on the group’s headquarters in Lebanon’s capital Beirut.

Israeli media reported earlier on Saturday that Nasrallah was at the headquarters that was attacked and that Israel had used “bunker-busting” bombs.

The news comes after a night of Israeli bombardment around Lebanon.

Ali Karki, the commander of Hezbollah’s southern front, and additional Hezbollah commanders were also killed in the huge air attack on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh on Friday, the Israeli military claimed.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said a total of six people were killed and 91 injured in the bombardment, which levelled six apartment buildings. Israeli air attacks continued to hammer Beirut’s southern suburbs and other areas of Lebanon into Saturday.

Where is Israel striking in Lebanon?
------------------------------------

The Israeli army says it has struck more than 140 Hezbollah targets since Friday evening, including the “central headquarters of Hezbollah” that, it says, was “embedded underneath residential buildings in the area of Beirut”.

On Saturday, Israel’s military said jet fighters had also attacked “dozens” of Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and various areas of southern Lebanon and the attacks are continuing.

Israeli forces said they had targeted buildings where weapons were believed to be stored as well as sites from where rockets were launched into Israel.

Israel launched an assault on the southern suburbs of Beirut in a series of attacks on Friday in the heaviest bombardment since it escalated its offensive against Lebanon earlier this month. “I have covered a lot of aftermaths of Israeli air strikes in these southern suburbs of Beirut but nothing like this.”

The latest wave of attacks on Beirut is reminiscent of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, one resident in Lebanon’s capital told Al Jazeera.

But just like then, these attacks will not do anything to stamp out Hezbollah, the resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

“At the end of the day they \[are\] just bombing, and killing people, and displacing people,” he said.

“\[Israel’s attacks\] won’t stop anything in the south … The rockets are there, the men are there.”

How many people have been hurt?
-------------------------------

As well as those killed in the assault in which Israeli forces killed Nasrallah, reports on Friday indicated at least 76 had been wounded.

On Saturday, Lebanon Civil Defense said one of its staff had been killed while providing emergency services in southern Beirut in the aftermath of the intense Israeli attacks on Friday evening.

One other staff member is in critical condition, Lebanon’s Civil Defense added.

The country’s state-run National News Agency reported that 11 doctors, nurses and paramedics had been killed and 10 others wounded in Israeli army attacks on civil defence centres and a medical clinic.

These attacks were carried out on the towns of Taybeh and Deir Siriane, close to the Israeli border.

Israel’s attacks on Lebanon have killed more than 700 people since Monday.

In a separate statement, Lebanon’s Health Ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop admitting nonemergency cases until the end of next week to make room for patients from Beirut’s southern suburbs.

What about the people in the residential buildings?
---------------------------------------------------

Dahiyeh is a densely populated area, home to more than half a million civilians, many of whom had been scrambling to evacuate to safety as Israel started attacking the area last week. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged Israel will continue its attacks.

Speaking at the United Nations in New York City on Friday, just hours before the attacks, he said, “As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely.”

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who is also in New York at the UN General Assembly, said in a statement that “the new aggression proves that the Israeli enemy does not care about all international efforts and calls for a ceasefire.”

aj-logo “Currently, everything is being hit.”

One resident who lives in the neighbouring Palestinian refugee camp, Bourj el Barajneh, told Al Jazeera the attack shook the entire area and camp residents are now fleeing to other areas.

Was there any warning?
----------------------

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said in a news briefing that Israel did not inform the United States in advance of the attack, but that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke by phone with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while the attack was in progress.

The attacks came as reports had emerged in recent days that negotiations for a ceasefire may be under way. Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV said the attacks destroyed at least seven buildings in the Haret Hreik suburb of the neighbourhood, turning them into a pile of rubble. While Hezbollah has its headquarters in the area, Dahiyeh “is a suburb, just like any other suburb in the world”, said Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem.

“Many families were starting to think about leaving, weighing their options, but where?” he said, noting that locations across Lebanon have been hit by attacks in recent days. Attacks on Beirut and areas around Lebanon continued through the night into Saturday.

More than a dozen explosions were reported in the neighbourhood of Dahiyeh, which had already been hit by air raids in recent days. Civil defence teams are working on putting out multiple fires in the area and have asked people to donate blood due to the likelihood of a high number of casualties.

The explosions were heard as far away as Jounieh, a 25-minute drive north of Beirut. “This attack was massive,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr."

Israel Preempts Hezbollah Attack
================================

\- Tuesday, August 27, 2024 by [Ari Cicurel](https://jinsa.org/person/ari-cicurel/)
 and |

Share:

_On August 25, Israel disrupted a planned, massive Hezbollah attack by preemptively striking and neutralizing roughly two-thirds of the projectiles that the terrorist group planned to launch from southern Lebanon. Hezbollah nevertheless managed to fire at least 230 rockets and 20 drones in retaliation for the Israeli strike that killed its most senior military commander, Fuad Shukr, on July 30._

_Israel’s preemptive strike combined with its successful air defenses marked substantial victories that strengthened its deterrence and signaled its ability to thwart a large attack from Hezbollah. That Hezbollah delayed its retaliatory strike for almost four weeks, that it limited its attack relative to the 4,000 rockets it is capable of launching daily, and that Iran chose to stay out of the fighting entirely all demonstrate the deterrent impact of close U.S.-Israeli coordination and the deployment of strong military forces to the Middle East. 
_

[Click here to read the NatSec Brief.](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Israel-Preempts-Hezbollah-Attack-NatSec-Brief-4.pdf) To deter further escalation, the United States should maintain its strong deployment of naval and air assets in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean regions and closely coordinate with Israel to help defend against further Hezbollah or Iran-linked attacks. These factors also indicate that neither Hezbollah nor Iran want to escalate to a full-scale war at this moment."

As tit-for-tat strikes strain [a ceasefire](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-ceasefire-explainer-intl-latam/index.html)
 between Israel and Hezbollah less than a week since it went into effect, Israel’s defense minister on Tuesday threatened to directly target the Lebanese state should the agreement fall apart.

Monday was the deadliest day since that agreement came into force last Wednesday, with Israeli strikes killing nine in southern Lebanon after Hezbollah fired at Israeli-occupied territory, citing Israeli truce violations.

“If we return to war, we will act with strength, go deeper,” Israel Katz said during a visit on Tuesday to the 146th Division of the Israel Defense Forces, near the Lebanese border.

Were the ceasefire to collapse, he said, “there will no longer be any exemptions for the State of Lebanon. The attacks were retaliation for Hezbollah firing two rockets at Israeli-occupied territory – themselves a response to near-daily Israeli attacks on Lebanon beginning the day after a truce began last Wednesday.

The exchange of fire casts doubt on the longevity of the ceasefire brokered by the United States – though State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted on Monday that “we have not seen the ceasefire break down.”

Both the American and French governments have privately told Israel that they believe it is violating the agreement, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the defense ministry, said in an interview with Israel’s Kan radio. The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said Israel had breached the ceasefire agreement “approximately 100” times since the truce went into effect.

“Both the French and the Americans didn’t really like it,” Smotrich said, referring to Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the truce. The military has said that it acted “in response to several acts by Hezbollah in Lebanon that posed a threat to Israeli civilians, in violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”

Those strikes led Hezbollah to target Israeli-occupied territory, at Shebaa Farms, on Monday. If until now we separated the State of Lebanon from Hezbollah – and the entirety of Beirut from Dahiyeh, which took very hard hits – this will no longer be the case.”

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz visits the 146th Division in northern Israel, near the Lebanese border, on December 3.

It comes a day after Israel conducted airstrikes across southern Lebanon. “But the IDF, in the days since the ceasefire, is enforcing it in a very determined way, both against Hezbollah and against civilians who are trying to return to villages in the border area without permission.”

Except for Tuesday, Israel has launched daily airstrikes in Lebanon since the day after a ceasefire went into effect last week. In a statement, the group said that Israel was guilty of “firing on civilians and airstrikes in different parts of Lebanon, resulting in the martyrdom of citizens and injuries to others, in addition to the continued violation of Lebanese airspace by hostile Israeli aircraft reaching the capital, Beirut.”

Hezbollah’s rockets fell in an open area and injured no one. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “a serious violation of the ceasefire,” and Israel launched airstrikes across southern Lebanon, killing nine, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. Smotrich said the IDF had struck 29 targets in Monday’s attack.

Israeli officials contend that far from violating the ceasefire, they are acting to enforce it.

“Yesterday was the first test – firing toward Mount Dov as if it were outside the usual conflict or open to interpretation,” Katz said on Tuesday, using the Israeli term for Shebaa Farms, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and has occupied ever since. During that time, Hezbollah fighters are expected to retreat some 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Israel-Lebanon border, while Israeli ground forces withdraw from Lebanese territory."

**JERUSALEM**

An adviser to Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli media on Wednesday.

Smotrich's adviser, who is a reserve soldier in the army's Alexandroni Brigade, was wounded but was in good health condition, Israeli Channel 12 reported.

It, however, didn't reveal his name, or when he was injured.

The Israeli army has deployed four army divisions for its ongoing ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

The Israeli army said early Wednesday that three soldiers were seriously injured in clashes in southern Lebanon.

Israel has mounted massive airstrikes across Lebanon against what it claims Hezbollah targets since Sept. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "Majdal Shams attack" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) describes a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, and mentions that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visited the site. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/27/what-we-know-about-israels-latest-attacks-on-lebanon)) reports on Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The JINSA article ([https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/](https://jinsa.org/jinsa_report/israel-preempts-hezbollah-attack/)) discusses an Israeli preemptive strike against Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, but does not mention Smotrich. <image:51> <image:1>


### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN reported on December 3, 2024, that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the American and French governments believe Israel is violating the agreement. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/middleeast/israel-threatens-hezbollah-lebanon-ceasefire-intl)) <image:k>

Drop Site News, dated August 29, 2025, discusses the situation in Gaza and Lebanon, mentioning Smotrich's plan for "total victory" in Gaza. ([https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-pakistan-lebanon-unifil-drop-site-daily)) <image:51> Anadolu Agency reported on October 9, 2024, that an advisor to Smotrich was injured in clashes in southern Lebanon.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The provided image shows individuals who appear to be in a public space, possibly a building. The search results mention Smotrich's involvement in events related to Lebanon and Hezbollah, including visits to attack sites and statements about the conflict. However, there is no direct evidence in the search results to confirm that the image depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

Need in-depth geopolitical, security, and risk analysis of Eurasian countries and regions? This event, which occurred after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, underscores Tel Aviv’s strategic capacity to neutralise high-value targets linked to Iran-supported militant groups.

Historical context, such as the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus and the subsequent [Tehran’s retaliatory missile and drone strikes](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/04/14/iran-attack-israel-report/)
, suggests that **this escalation could provoke a powerful response from Iran**. The broader geopolitical repercussions could influence global investment patterns, with investors potentially seeking safer markets, affecting economic growth in the region.

### Background Information

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of _Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya_ (Hamas), was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard after a targeted strike [on his residence](https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779)
. This rhetoric implies a possible escalation in retaliatory measures against Israeli targets, both domestically and potentially internationally.

**Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination poses a significant threat to the fragile ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas**. **_Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran; Hamas blames Israel._**
2. Haniyeh was in the city to attend the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Hamas and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed the attack, attributing it to Israeli forces**. This incident has further inflamed the already volatile situation, raising fears of a widespread escalation that could engulf multiple countries and lead to severe humanitarian crises.

### Contextual Analysis

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran signifies a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Various international organisations and governments have criticised Haniyeh’s killing, emphasising the need for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

**The recent Israeli airstrikes in a southern suburb of Beirut, resulting in the targeted killing of Fuad Shukr**, [a senior Hezbollah commander](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwxyjydlyo)
, serves to underscore Israel’s proactive stance in neutralising perceived threats from regional adversaries."

From [Source](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/): 
Content: "However, it is unlikely to impact the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip or the negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages.

Eight hours after the preemptive targeting of senior Hizbullah military leader Fouad Shuker by the Israeli Air Force in the Al-Dahyah neighborhood of Beirut on July 30, Iran officially confirmed that Ismail Haniyeh was killed early in the morning of July 31 in Tehran, along with his bodyguard Wasim Abu Shaaban.

Hamas confirmed his death, blamed Israel, and vowed revenge.

Israel has remained silent, with Prime Minister Netanyahu instructing ministers not to comment publicly.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing.

Israeli intelligence sources report that Ismail Haniyeh, based in Qatar, was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7.

Accounts from Tehran state that Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed in their apartment at a guest house for foreign leaders.

The preemptive targeting was possibly by a submarine-launched missile from a distance at the bedroom where Haniyeh was staying.

This event is a double blow to both Hamas and Iran.

Haniyeh played a crucial role in managing Hamas’s political strategies, building connections throughout the Muslim world, and securing donations to fund its terror activities.

The Preemptive Targeting of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran
====================================================

A Double Blow to Hamas and Iran

Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei’s declaration on July 31, 2024.

#### Table of Contents

Iran announced the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during his visit to Tehran, where he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pazashekian.

This event is significant both operationally and morale-wise. Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, condemned the assassination, calling it “a cowardly act that will not go unpunished.”

The movement will elect a new leader to replace Haniyeh.

This is another severe blow to Hamas’s morale and operations following the killing of Muhammad Deif, the supreme commander of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, a rival of Haniyeh, is likely to benefit from this development, as he commands Hamas in Gaza and holds a crucial bargaining chip – Israeli hostages.

Hamas asserts that Haniyeh’s killing is part of an Israeli effort to pressure its leadership regarding the hostages and maintains that this will not alter its stance.

The death of Ismail Haniyeh will not end the conflict in the Gaza Strip as long as Yahya Sinwar and other members of Hamas’s military leadership remain alive.

He was a key figure in Hamas’s alignment with Shiite Iran, as opposed to Khaled Mashaal, who favors closer ties with the Sunni “Muslim Brotherhood” axis, including Qatar, Turkey, and Pakistan.

Iran faces criticism for failing to adequately protect Haniyeh on its soil, marking a significant security lapse.

This incident adds to other security failures in Iran, such as the assassination of Fakhri Mohsen Zadeh, the so-called father of Iran’s nuclear program, by the Israeli Mossad in November 2020.

Haniyeh’s decision to leave Doha, Qatar, and attend the Iranian president’s inauguration in Tehran proved fatal, providing an opportunity for Mossad to target him.

Before his death, Haniyeh met with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Islamic Jihad leader Ziad Nachala.

It is believed that the Israeli Mossad avoided targeting Haniyeh in Qatar for two reasons: Qatar’s role as a mediator in the Israeli hostages’ negotiations and operational considerations.

Hamas claims that Haniyeh’s death will not alter its campaign against Israel, which has previously seen the elimination of key leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas. (res.) Maurice Hirsch](https://jcpa.org/researcher/maurice-hirsch/)

([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)) <image:k> The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) reported on August 1, 2024, that Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, mentioning that Israeli intelligence sources reported Haniyeh was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on October 7. ([https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/)) <image:6741>, <image:6740>, <image:6744>, <image:6745>, <image:6746>, <image:6749>, <image:6750>, <image:6751>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli intelligence Ismail Haniyeh WhatsApp July 31 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The bne Gulf bureau reported on August 1, 2024, about the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, mentioning unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, and that the attack occurred in Tehran. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) <image:6727>

SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit reported on July 31, 2024, that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, with Hamas blaming Israel. ([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)) <image:k> The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA) reported on August 1, 2024, that Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on July 31, mentioning that Israeli intelligence sources reported Haniyeh was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on October 7. ([https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/)) <image:6741>, <image:6740>, <image:6744>, <image:6745>, <image:6746>, <image:6749>, <image:6750>, <image:6751>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, mentioning the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> Modern Diplomacy, on August 4, 2024, discussed the assassination of Haniyeh and the potential use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, suggesting that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications. ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/))


## Elaboration
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.


## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination WhatsApp tracking evidence")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have used cell phone tracking or intercepted communications to locate Ismail Haniyeh for the assassination. However, there is no direct evidence confirming that WhatsApp was used for tracking. The claim remains unconfirmed.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for his assassination on July 31, 2024, is not confirmed. While reports indicate Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran and suggest the use of cell phone tracking or intercepted communications by Israeli intelligence, there is no direct evidence to verify that WhatsApp was specifically used for tracking, as indicated by sources like the [bne Gulf bureau](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/) and [Modern Diplomacy](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/).

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”
