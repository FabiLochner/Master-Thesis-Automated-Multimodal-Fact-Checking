## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NYCFPA published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023 (![image 6350](media/2025-08-29_19-48-1756496915-982236.jpg)). CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reporting that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks (<image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>).

A Stack Exchange search result discusses the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a post on X (Visegrad24) citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase. However, it also includes information from the World Population Review, stating a 2.88% annual change, and a Times of Israel article, claiming a 6% decrease. The PCBS predicts a growth rate of about 1% during 2024. The result also mentions deaths, births, and emigration. The CIA Factbook suggests a pre-war growth rate of around 2.13% (![image 6373](media/2025-08-29_19-49-1756496959-033759.jpg)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261): 
Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on July 10, 2025, stating that Gaza's population has dropped by 10% since October 2023. <image:k> The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the population decreased to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to mid-2024 estimates, and to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from mid-2025 estimates. The article also mentions that over 57,000 Palestinians were killed and nearly 100,000 have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase based on August 2023 growth forecasts. However, CNN reports a 6% decrease in 2024, and Anadolu Agency states a 10% drop since October 2023. The Stack Exchange search result also provides conflicting data, citing a 2.02% increase from The World Factbook, a 2.88% annual change from World Population Review, and a 6% decrease from a Times of Israel article. The PCBS predicts a 1% growth rate during 2024.

The conflicting reports highlight the difficulty in accurately assessing population changes during the ongoing conflict. Factors such as deaths, births, and emigration significantly impact the population, making it challenging to provide a definitive figure.

To verify the claim, more specific data is needed, including the exact methodology used by each source, the time frame considered, and the specific data points used to calculate the population change.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) estimates that Gaza's population has fallen by about 6% since the start of the war on October 7, 2023, according to a Euronews article published on January 2, 2025. The PCBS estimates the population has declined by around 160,000 to 2.1 million, including over 55,000 presumed dead and 100,000 people that have left Gaza since October 7, 2023. The Wikipedia article "Demographics of Palestine" provides population data for the Gaza Strip, with the CIA World Factbook estimating the population at 2,098,389 in 2023. The PCBS estimated the population in mid-2023 to be 2,226,544. CEIC Data provides PCBS population projections, with the latest figures for Gaza Strip population at 2,106,745.000 in 2021.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the Gaza Strip, last updated on January 2025, states that the Gaza Strip has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.). The article also mentions that the Gaza war, which began in 2023, has caused widespread destruction, a humanitarian crisis, and an imminent famine. The article also mentions that over 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war. <image:i> <image:j> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is not supported by the evidence. While one source, the NYCFPA, mentions this increase, other sources, including CNN, Anadolu Agency, and the PCBS, report a decrease in population. The PCBS estimates a 6% decrease since the start of the war. The Wikipedia article on the Gaza Strip mentions a 1.99% annual population growth rate in 2023, but also notes the war's impact, including widespread destruction and a humanitarian crisis.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), report a decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, contradicting the claim of a 2.02% increase. The evidence indicates a significant population decline due to the ongoing conflict. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While one source initially cited a 2.02% increase, multiple sources, including the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and CNN, report a decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, due to the ongoing conflict, with the PCBS estimating a 6% decrease ([Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2025/01/02/palestinian-statistics-bureau-projects-gaza-population-down-by-6-since-start-of-war)).
