## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reports from June 25, 2025, indicate conflicting information regarding Esmail Qaani's status. Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018)) and The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902)) reported Qaani's presence in Tehran. The New York Times reported Qaani's death in an Israeli strike, according to an Iranian source.

A Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) confirms Qaani as the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. A video from June 24, 2025, showed Qaani in Tehran, contradicting reports of his death. Qaani was rumored to be under suspicion for a potential intelligence leak. <image:0> <image:k> <image:k>
