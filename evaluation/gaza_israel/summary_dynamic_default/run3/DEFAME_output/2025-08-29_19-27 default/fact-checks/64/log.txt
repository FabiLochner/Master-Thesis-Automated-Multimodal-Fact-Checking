Content: The Wikipedia article states that Esmail Qaani is the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. In June 2025, The New York Times reported that Qaani was killed in Israeli airstrikes, but this was not confirmed by Iranian authorities. However, a video on social media from June 24, 2025, showed Qaani in Tehran, contradicting reports of his death. The article also mentions that Qaani was rumored to have been under suspicion for a potential intelligence leak that enabled Israel to devastate Hezbollah in 2024. <image:k>
