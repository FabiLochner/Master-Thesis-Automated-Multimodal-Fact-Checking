Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on September 7, 2024, discussing protests in France against the appointment of Michel Barnier as the new prime minister. The protests were organized by parties on the political left. The article mentions that the left-wing candidate for prime minister, Lucie Castets, was rejected by President Emmanuel Macron. <image:6007>, <image:6012>. The article also mentions that Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella from the National Rally have stated they will not join the Barnier government.

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in question is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as evidenced by a Vanity Fair article ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)) and other sources, not a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory. The claim is therefore false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
