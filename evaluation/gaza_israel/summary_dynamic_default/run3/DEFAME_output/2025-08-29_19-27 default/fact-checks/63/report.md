### Evidence from `web_search`
The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, discusses an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, including women and children, and mentions a month-old girl pulled from the rubble (![image 6472](media/2025-08-29_19-54-1756497295-024126.jpg)). The BBC article from December 29, 2023, reports on a baby girl found alive in Rafah after an Israeli air strike that killed her mother and sister, and mentions over 21,500 deaths, mostly children and women, during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza (![image 6473](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497301-724080.jpg), ![image 6474](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497302-077142.jpg), ![image 6478](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497303-065916.jpg), ![image 6480](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497303-443718.jpg), ![image 6484](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497304-065669.jpg), ![image 6486](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497304-582401.jpg), ![image 6488](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497305-099235.jpg), ![image 6492](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497306-463528.jpg)). Democracy Now! published an article on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike on a Palestinian pediatrician's home in Gaza, which killed nine of her ten children (![image 6505](media/2025-08-29_19-55-1756497313-117806.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The image was posted on Flickr in 2006. While there have been instances of children being found in the rubble of homes in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes, as reported by PBS News and BBC, the image in the claim is not related to those events.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is of mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The image has been circulating online with a false context. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of mummified children from a Bolivian museum, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-)). While there have been reports of children being found in the rubble in Gaza after Israeli airstrikes, the image is unrelated to those events.
