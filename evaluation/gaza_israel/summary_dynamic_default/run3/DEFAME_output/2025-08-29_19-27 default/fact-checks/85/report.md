## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll. The original footage was published by Channel 12 on May 27, 2022. The doctored image asked if a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian. Channel 12 did not broadcast the purported poll. The original question was: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?” (![image 6696](media/2025-08-29_20-04-1756497865-200174.jpg), ![image 6694](media/2025-08-29_20-04-1756497858-121625.jpg), ![image 6695](media/2025-08-29_20-04-1756497864-572526.jpg)).

The National Desk discusses a doctored image of a poll, which was shared by Rep. Erakat, seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12 (![image 6699](media/2025-08-29_20-04-1756497868-122978.jpg)). An article from Mondoweiss discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was conducted by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll. The original footage was published by Channel 12 on May 27, 2022. The doctored image asked if a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian. Channel 12 did not broadcast the purported poll. The original question was: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”


## Final Judgement
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll that was not broadcast by Channel 12. The original question was different from the one presented in the image.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll that was not broadcast by Channel 12. The original footage, published on May 27, 2022, featured a different question than the one presented in the image, which falsely claimed to ask about a soldier's permission to rape a prisoner. The original question was: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”
