The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. News articles from February 2025 ([Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai), [The Nation](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434), [Khaosod English](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) refute the idea of Israeli settlements or business dominance in Pai District, Thailand, and the geolocation analysis suggests the image was taken in Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
