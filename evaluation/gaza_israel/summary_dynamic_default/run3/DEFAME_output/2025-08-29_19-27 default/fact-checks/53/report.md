## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 26, 2024, CNN reported on a meeting between Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, mentioning Trump's Truth Social posts about the meeting (<image:k>). On July 25, 2024, Voice of America reported that Trump posted on Truth Social, condemning pro-Hamas protests near the U.S. Capitol, but did not include the quote from the claim (![image 5352](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913004-996719.jpg)).

The Tennessee Lookout reported on July 25, 2024, that Trump said on Truth Social he would welcome Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago on Friday (![image 5354](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913008-261964.jpg), ![image 5357](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913017-893899.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, none of the provided sources mention the quote from the claim. The Voice of America article mentions a post condemning pro-Hamas protests, and the Tennessee Lookout reported on Trump welcoming Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago.

The CNN article mentions Trump's Truth Social posts about the meeting with Netanyahu, but it does not include the quote from the claim.

Therefore, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump posted the specific quote on Truth Social on July 25, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, but none of the provided sources contain the quote from the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as reported by sources like [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html) and the [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), none of the provided evidence supports the specific quote attributed to him in the claim.
