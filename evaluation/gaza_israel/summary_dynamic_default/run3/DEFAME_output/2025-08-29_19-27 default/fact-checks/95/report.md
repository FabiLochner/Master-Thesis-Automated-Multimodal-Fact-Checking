## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, after an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a man holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in Turkey in February 2023. The claim misrepresents the context of the image, stating it depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of a father in Turkey holding his deceased daughter's hand after an earthquake in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024, as stated in the claim. The photo was taken by Adem Altan and published by multiple news sources, including The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)).
