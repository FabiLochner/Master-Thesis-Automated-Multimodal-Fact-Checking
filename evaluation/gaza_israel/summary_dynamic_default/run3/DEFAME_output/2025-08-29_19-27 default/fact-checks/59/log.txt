Content: The website dawahilallah.com published an article on August 14, 2025, discussing the destruction of two Israeli tanks by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis, using Yassin-105 shells and a side IED. <image:4221>. The article also mentions an attack by JNIM (Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimin) in Burkina Faso on a military base, resulting in the death of 20 soldiers. <image:4234>. The website also discusses the four-year achievements of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, and a trade agreement between Kyrgyzstan and the Islamic Emirate. <image:4223>, <image:4231>. The website also mentions a statement by the IEA spokesperson regarding the US human rights report on Afghanistan. <image:4228>.

The claim '<image:34> This image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters, destroying multiple vehicles and injuring or killing their crews in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was an Israeli ground offensive in Jabalia in October 2024, and Hamas fighters were active in the area, a reverse image search of the provided image revealed that it was used in articles discussing the 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and an attack by Al-Qassam Brigades in Khan Yunis, indicating the image is not from October 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
