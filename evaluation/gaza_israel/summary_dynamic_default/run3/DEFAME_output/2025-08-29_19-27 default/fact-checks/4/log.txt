Useful result: From [Source](https://hausatv.com/amurka-ta-kai-hare-hare-a-yankunan-kasa-yemen/): Found exact image on website with title: Amurka Ta Kai Hare-hare A Yankunan Kasa Yemen â€“ HAUSATV
Content: The Hausa-language website HAUSATV published an article on April 11, 2025, reporting that U.S. warplanes conducted a series of attacks on various regions of Yemen, including the city of Sana'a. The article includes an image of the attacks <image:5>. The attacks were in response to Yemen's attacks on Israel.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The image is likely from Palestine or Israel. While the U.S. did conduct airstrikes in Yemen on December 22, 2024, as reported by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/us-army-says-two-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-friendly-fire), the claim that these strikes were a direct reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital is not explicitly supported by the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
