Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-banning-unrwa-palestinian-territories-gaza-hamas-west-bank-rcna189554): 
Content: The NBC News article discusses Israel's ban on UNRWA in Palestinian territories. <image:5990>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The black ribbon on the UNRWA logo was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and to pay tribute to UNRWA team members killed in Gaza, not to mourn Yahya Sinwar, as reported by [DW](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996) and [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5).

So, the overall veracity is: false
