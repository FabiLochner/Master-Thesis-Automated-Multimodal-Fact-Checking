## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and would meet with Netanyahu later in the week, underscoring a commitment to Israel's defense ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address)). The Washington Post reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Netanyahu addresses Congress ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-bibi-netanyahu-speech-congress/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-bibi-netanyahu-speech-congress/)).

Al-Monitor also reported on Netanyahu's visit, mentioning a scheduled meeting with Harris, who is expected to largely adhere to Biden's foreign policies ([https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit)). ![image 6299](media/2025-08-29_19-47-1756496867-846704.jpg), ![image 6301](media/2025-08-29_19-47-1756496873-233472.jpg), ![image 6302](media/2025-08-29_19-47-1756496873-601290.jpg), ![image 6303](media/2025-08-29_19-47-1756496873-720188.jpg), ![image 6305](media/2025-08-29_19-47-1756496873-979876.jpg)


## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 22, 2024, amid his visit to the United States ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address), [https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit)). However, the evidence does not contain the exact quote attributed to Harris in the claim.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be fully determined without additional information. Specifically, the exact statement made by Harris on July 22, 2024, needs to be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 23, 2024, that Kamala Harris said she would "always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself" and ensure Israel has the ability to do so, and also mentioned a meeting with Netanyahu where Harris said she held an "unwavering commitment to Israel" (![image 6315](media/2025-08-29_19-48-1756496889-491364.jpg)). Al-Monitor, published on July 23, 2024, discusses Harris's statements on Israel and the Gaza war, mentioning that Harris is expected to largely adhere to Biden's foreign policies and that Harris's aides indicated she would not preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress (![image 6337](media/2025-08-29_19-48-1756496901-116963.jpg)). Neither source provides the exact quote from the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Kamala Harris expressed support for Israel around the time of Netanyahu's visit. However, the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" is not found in the provided sources. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.
