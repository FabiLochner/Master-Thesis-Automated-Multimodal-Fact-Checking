The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine. Escalate now" message, as confirmed by multiple sources, including articles from the [Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/) and the [Montreal Gazette](https://montrealgazette.com/). However, the claim that Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante authorized the sign is not directly supported by the provided evidence, although the City of Montreal was involved with the signs.

So, the overall veracity is: false
