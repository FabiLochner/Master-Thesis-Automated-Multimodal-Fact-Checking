## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost, as reported by [Marca.com](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2023/10/11/6526c4cc22601d2d748b45da.html) and [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). Variety also reported that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has shown support for Israel amid the Hamas attacks ([Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)). The sources do not show Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. ![image 2699](media/2025-07-20_11-27-1753010831-407396.jpg) ![image 1](media/0.jpg) ![image 2700](media/2025-07-20_11-27-1753010866-160819.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
Yahoo News published an article about a fake image of Dwayne Johnson ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html)). Euronews published an article on November 14, 2023, about Dwayne Johnson ([https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/14/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-political-parties-asked-him-to-run-for-president](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/14/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-political-parties-asked-him-to-run-for-president)).

Myth Detector states that the quote is fabricated ([https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/)). ![image 4831](media/2025-08-23_01-10-1755911457-317782.jpg) ![image 4832](media/2025-08-23_01-10-1755911457-433942.jpg) ![image 4833](media/2025-08-23_01-10-1755911457-774439.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image is fake. Multiple sources confirm that the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated, and a quote associated with the image is also fabricated.


## Final Judgement
The image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated. While he has expressed views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, the specific image and associated quote are not authentic.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/).
