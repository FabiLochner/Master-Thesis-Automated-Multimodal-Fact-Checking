Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/26/trump-calls-kamala-harris-statement-on-gaza-war-disrespectful): 
Content: The Guardian reports that Donald Trump criticized Kamala Harris's remarks on the Gaza war before meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu. The article mentions a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu in Florida to discuss the conflict. The article is more than one year old. <image:4111>, <image:4112>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o): 
Content: The BBC reports that on July 26, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. During the visit, Trump criticized Kamala Harris's remarks on Israel as "disrespectful." Netanyahu stated that Israel would send negotiators to Rome for talks aimed at ending the war with Hamas. The article also mentions that Trump said he would seek peace if re-elected.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign is unverified. While reports from Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)) and Yahoo News ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-latest-scheme-beat-harris-191201451.html)) indicate a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu discussing a ceasefire, the specific details about Trump's motivations are disputed, with both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denying the report, as reported by Newsweek ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
