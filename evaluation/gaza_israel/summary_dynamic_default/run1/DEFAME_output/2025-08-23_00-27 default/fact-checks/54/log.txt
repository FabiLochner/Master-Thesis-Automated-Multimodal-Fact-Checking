Content: The Missouri Independent published an article on October 13, 2023, stating that the U.S. State Department will arrange charter flights out of Israel for U.S. citizens starting Friday, October 13, 2023, due to reduced commercial flights. <image:4182>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832): 
Content: Newsweek reports that the State Department has begun assisted departure flights from Israel for U.S. citizens and lawful residents. The article mentions that the State Department has not offered such flights since the beginning of the war between Hamas and Israel on October 7, 2023. <image:4187> The article was written by Mandy Taheri.

The claim 'As the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalate in October, 2024, the U.S. government is offering Americans loans to pay for flights out of Lebanon while they have been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year 'on US taxpayers' dime.' is false.
Justification: The U.S. government is providing assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including emergency loans for flights, as reported by [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) and [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region/). The U.S. has also arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel since October 2023, as stated by the [Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/) and [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832). However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not directly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
