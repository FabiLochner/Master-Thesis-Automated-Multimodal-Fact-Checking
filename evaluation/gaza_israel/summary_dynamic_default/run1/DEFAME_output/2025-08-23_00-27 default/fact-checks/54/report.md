## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. government is assisting Americans in Lebanon amid the escalating conflict between Hezbollah and Israel by connecting them with commercial flights, adding extra flights, and offering short-term emergency loans, as reported by [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) (![image 4165](media/2025-08-23_00-48-1755910119-248213.jpg), ![image 4166](media/2025-08-23_00-48-1755910119-468936.jpg), ![image 4167](media/2025-08-23_00-48-1755910119-810023.jpg), ![image 4168](media/2025-08-23_00-48-1755910120-065142.jpg)) and [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region/). U.S. News & World Report ([https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-10-03/us-arranges-flights-to-bring-americans-out-of-lebanon-as-others-seek-escape](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-10-03/us-arranges-flights-to-bring-americans-out-of-lebanon-as-others-seek-escape)) reported that the U.S. government arranged flights to bring approximately 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon and is offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon (<image:k>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel published an article about a Nefesh Bâ€™Nefesh charter flight carrying new immigrants to Israel on August 20, 2025, with immigration numbers surging despite the ongoing wars and diplomatic struggles. The organization saw an 80% spike in aliyah inquiries immediately following the October 7 attacks. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/aboard-first-aliyah-flight-since-oct-7-immigrants-say-war-strengthened-their-resolve/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/aboard-first-aliyah-flight-since-oct-7-immigrants-say-war-strengthened-their-resolve/)) ![image 4175](media/2025-08-23_00-50-1755910221-020482.jpg), ![image 4174](media/2025-08-23_00-50-1755910220-789536.jpg)

The Missouri Independent reported on October 13, 2023, that the U.S. State Department would arrange charter flights out of Israel for U.S. citizens starting Friday, October 13, 2023, due to reduced commercial flights. ([https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/)) ![image 4182](media/2025-08-23_00-50-1755910230-277321.jpg) Newsweek reports that the State Department has begun assisted departure flights from Israel for U.S. citizens and lawful residents since the beginning of the war between Hamas and Israel on October 7, 2023.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon amid escalating tensions with Hezbollah, as reported by [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) and [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region/). Additionally, the U.S. has arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel since October 2023, as stated by the [Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/) and [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832).

The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has arranged flights for *U.S. citizens* out of Israel, the evidence does not specify the nationality of those on the flights.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not verified.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is providing assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including emergency loans for flights. The U.S. has also arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel since October 2023. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not directly supported by the evidence.

`false`
