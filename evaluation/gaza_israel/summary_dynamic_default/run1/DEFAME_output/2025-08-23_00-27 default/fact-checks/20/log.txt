The article mentions that Trump and his spokesperson referred to a grant from USAID to the International Medical Corps (IMC) for medical services in Gaza. Officials stated that the $100 million for these programs included contraceptives, but the IMC stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms. <image:i>
