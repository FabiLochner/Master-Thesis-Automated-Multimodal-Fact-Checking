## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Johns Hopkins Hub published an article on February 4, 2025, discussing a study that debunked claims of a nuclear test in Iran on October 5, 2024, and mentioned a supposed seismic event in Israel on the same evening (![image 4505](media/2025-08-23_01-02-1755910966-015403.jpg)). The article from alphadefense.in, published on October 7, 2024, discusses a seismic event in Iran on October 5, 2024, which led to speculation about a nuclear test (![image 4509](media/2025-08-23_01-03-1755910989-888722.jpg), ![image 4510](media/2025-08-23_01-03-1755910993-063419.jpg), ![image 4512](media/2025-08-23_01-03-1755910995-713256.jpg)).

NDTV published an article on October 7, 2024, discussing earthquakes in Iran and Israel on October 5, 2024, and the speculation of a covert nuclear test (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The article mentions that a moderate earthquake struck both Iran and Israel on the evening of October 5, 2024.
