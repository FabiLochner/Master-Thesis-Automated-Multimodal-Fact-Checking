## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, as reported by AFP Malaysia and The National Desk. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, was about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism, but the altered image shared on social media on August 11, 2024, falsely presents a question about whether a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner. Channel 12 has debunked the false posts. The image was shared by Noura Erakat and Rashida Tlaib. Another article from Mondoweiss.net discusses a poll showing that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees.
