## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article published by NYCFPA on December 19, 2024, states that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023 (![image 4145](media/2025-08-23_00-47-1755910078-346716.jpg), ![image 4150](media/2025-08-23_00-48-1755910085-861741.jpg)). CNN reported that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since the war began on October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 deaths (![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg)).

Skeptics.stackexchange.com references a post on X citing The World Factbook, claiming a 2.02% increase in population, and the World Population Review, which states a 2.88% annual change. A Times of Israel article claims the population has fallen 6% since the war began. The result also cites a United Nations report of around 45,000 deaths as of December 2024. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics predicted a decrease in the growth rate in Gaza for 2024.


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an Anadolu Agency article from July 10, 2025, Gaza's population has decreased by 10% since October 2023, with the population dropping from 2,226,544 to approximately 2,114,301. [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261) A Euronews article from January 2, 2025, cites the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), estimating a 6% decrease since October 7, 2023, with a reduction of around 160,000 people to 2.1 million.

Additionally, a Wikipedia article states that the Gaza Strip has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.) and also mentions a 6% decrease in population since the war began. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip)


## Elaboration
The claim is contradicted by the evidence. Multiple sources indicate a decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, not an increase. The evidence cites a 6% decrease according to CNN, the Times of Israel, and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. An Anadolu Agency article states a 10% decrease.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the population in Gaza has decreased since October 7, 2023, contradicting the claim of a 2.02% increase. Multiple sources, including CNN, the Times of Israel, and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, report a decrease in population.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Gaza's population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is false. Multiple sources, including a [CNN report](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261), and a [Euronews article](https://www.euronews.com/2025/01/02/palestinian-statistics-bureau-projects-gaza-population-down-by-6-since-start-of-war), indicate a decrease in population during this period.
