## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's presence unlawful and obligating it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence. ([https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176))

The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024. The UN website provides links to the report in multiple languages and mentions the General Assembly resolution ES-10/24, a Commission of Inquiry, Human Rights Council resolutions, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ made a ruling in July 2024 regarding Israel's actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel was declared an "illegal state." Instead, the ICJ found Israel's *presence* unlawful.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The ICJ did rule on the matter in July 2024, but the specific wording of the claim is not entirely supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. While the ICJ did not declare Israel an "illegal state," it did rule on the legality of its presence and actions.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's presence unlawful and obligating it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations, as stated in the [ICJ summary](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176). However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an "illegal state," as the claim suggests.
