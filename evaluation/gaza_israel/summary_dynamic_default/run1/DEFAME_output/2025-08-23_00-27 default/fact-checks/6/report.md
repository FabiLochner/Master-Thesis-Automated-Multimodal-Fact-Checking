The University at Buffalo ([https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html)) reports on an AI-generated image falsely claiming Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized, referencing an AFP Fact Check. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-awake-recovering-after-successful-prostate-removal-surgery-pms-office/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-awake-recovering-after-successful-prostate-removal-surgery-pms-office/)) states that Netanyahu underwent prostate removal surgery in December 2024 and was in the Knesset in November 2024.

AFP ([https://cedmohub.eu/doctored-photo-does-not-show-israeli-pm-netanyahu-hospitalised-with-covid/](https://cedmohub.eu/doctored-photo-does-not-show-israeli-pm-netanyahu-hospitalised-with-covid/)) debunked a claim that a photo showed Netanyahu hospitalized with a mutated strain of coronavirus, stating the image was digitally altered. ![image 3671](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909022-753421.jpg), ![image 3672](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909023-260118.jpg), ![image 3673](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909023-807681.jpg), ![image 3675](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909035-893554.jpg), ![image 3676](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909036-957265.jpg), ![image 3678](media/2025-08-23_00-30-1755909042-416559.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image is AI-generated and was used to falsely claim Netanyahu was hospitalized. Furthermore, Netanyahu was in the Knesset in November 2024 and underwent prostate removal surgery in December 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is an AI-generated fabrication used to falsely claim Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized. Evidence from multiple sources confirms this, including reports from the University at Buffalo, The Times of Israel, and AFP Fact Check.
