Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on October 1, 2024, reporting on an Iranian missile attack against Israel. <image:1>. The article states that Iran fired missiles at Israel in response to Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders. The article mentions that alarms sounded in Israel, and the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The article also includes reactions from world leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that Iran had "made a big mistake" and "will pay for it."

The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While an Iranian missile attack on Israel did occur on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland during the attack. Information about Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland is related to a later event in January 2025, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next).

So, the overall veracity is: false
