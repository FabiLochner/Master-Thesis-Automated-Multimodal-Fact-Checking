Useful result: From [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/): 
Content: The Atlantic Council published an article on March 18, 2025, discussing the US approach toward the Houthis. The article mentions that on March 15, 2025, Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. The article also mentions that Russia has aided Houthi operations. <image:635>, <image:637>, <image:638>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that the Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The article mentions that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport. It also mentions that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was a ceasefire and a pledge to stop attacking ships, the Houthis continued attacks after Trump's election, as evidenced by attacks on ships and the Tel Aviv airport, according to sources like the [ABC News article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774) and the [Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis).

So, the overall veracity is: false
