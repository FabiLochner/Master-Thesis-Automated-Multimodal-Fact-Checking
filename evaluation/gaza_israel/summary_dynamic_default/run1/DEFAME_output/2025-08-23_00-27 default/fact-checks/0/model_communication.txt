**What was claimed:** A picture shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the US army, who was recently killed in the Gaza Strip.

**Our verdict:** There’s no evidence that any US army general has recently been killed in Gaza, and a defence official confirmed there is no US general with this name. This is an old image taken in Iraq of soldiers with different names.

A reverse image search reveals the picture [was taken in Iraq](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg)
. According to an archived version of a [2009 blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120129122933/http://www.ng.mil/news/archives/2009/07/071609-Leading-print.aspx)
 on a US military website, the image shows two soldiers, neither named John Pagri.

The Pentagon also confirmed that the camouflage pattern <image:3648>
 in the uniform seen in the photo was [retired in 2019](https://www.army.mil/article/228411/acu_pattern_officially_retired_new_uniform_improvements_on_the_way)
 and has since changed to Operational Camouflage Pattern <image:3655>
.

Moreover, there are no credible reports of a US army general being killed in the Gaza Strip recently.

It’s important to consider whether something shows what it claims to before sharing it. Army, in the Gaza Strip.” It has also been shared on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tibou.tibou.7/posts/pfbid0QTRfxJW7Smxckqcu9NVFyXTeYCWhpYkFJwUCy9LbmKRmMbtznuZsy46pp2DLLSc8l)

.

But there’s no evidence these reports are genuine. The photo used is at least 15 years old, and shows US soldiers in Iraq with different names.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense told Full Fact the posts are false and that there are no US service members in Gaza. You can read more about this in our guides on how to fact check [misleading images](https://fullfact.org/online/how-spot-misleading-images-online/)

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

An Israeli helicopter shoots flares over the Gaza Strip hours after a rocket from the Palestinian enclave hit a house near Tel Aviv and wounded seven people, leading to fears of a severe escalation, on March 25, 2019. (Mohammed Abed/AFP)

A Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell attempted to down an Israeli military helicopter during the last round of fighting in Gaza early this month, according to a report Monday in the Jerusalem-based Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds.

The attack failed, according to the report.

Just before the Islamic Jihad operatives could launch a shoulder-mounted missile at the chopper, which was operating near Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip, they were spotted by an Israeli jet and destroyed from the air, the paper said, citing unnamed officials from Gaza-based terror groups as its sources.

There was no immediate confirmation of the Palestinian report from Israeli sources.

The Iran-backed Islamic Jihad later confirmed that it carried out the attack, identifying one of the operatives who was killed as he aimed the missile at the helicopter as Bilal al-Bina, a senior officer in the group’s air defense unit.

The terror group said al-Bina was killed attempting to shoot down the helicopter on May 5.

The reported incident took place during a two-day escalation in Gaza that saw terror groups in the Strip fired nearly 700 rockets and missiles, mostly aiming for Israeli population centers. Four Israelis were killed in the barrages.

In response, the IDF carried out some 350 airstrikes on Hamas and Islamic Jihad targets in the Palestinian territory. Twenty-five Palestinians were reported killed, many of them acknowledged members of terror groups.

The newspaper cited Gazan officials who claimed the attempt to down an Israeli helicopter was a response to “the occupation forces bombing civilian buildings and killing of civilians,” according to a translation carried by Israel’s Channel 12.

Israeli Air Force helicopters are equipped with anti-missile systems, but missiles have on occasion been able to penetrate these defenses, including in the case of a Yas’ur transport helicopter downed by Hezbollah fire during the Second Lebanon War in the summer of 2006.

GAZA: Israeli warplanes pounded Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip on Monday after an apparent rocket attack near Tel Aviv. One Israeli strike targeted the office of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. He was not thought to have been in the office at the time, as Hamas routinely evacuates its buildings when it expects Israeli attacks.

“If there is any violation of the red lines by the occupation, our people will not surrender and the resistance is able to deter it,” Haniyeh said

Israeli warplanes attacked targets across the coastal enclave. Palestinian radio stations and Hamas TV played patriotic songs calling for “resistance” against Israel.

Another strike destroyed a building in Gaza City that Israel claimed was a secret headquarters for Hamas security and intelligence. Local residents said it housed the offices of the Multasim insurance company. Hamas’s interior security office in Gaza City was also hit. Five Palestinians were injured in the airstrikes.

The Israeli military said it was assigning two brigades to the Gaza area and some reservists were being called up. Troops moved toward the border, where the military also closed several roads to civilian traffic.

We are prepared for a wide range of scenarios,” military spokesman Ronen Manelis said.

The airstrikes were retaliation for what Israel claimed was a long-range rocket attack by Hamas early on Monday that destroyed a house near Tel Aviv. Seven people were injured.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was under pressure to deliver a tough response as he faces a strong challenge in next month’s Knesset elections, analysts said.

In comments from Washington, Netanyahu said “Israel is responding forcefully to this wanton aggression,” while Trump spoke of Israel’s “right to defend itself.”

Netanyahu said he would return home after meeting Trump, canceling an address to pro-Israel lobby AIPAC’s annual conference on Tuesday.

One Israeli strike destroyed a building in Gaza City that Israel alleged was a secret headquarters for Hamas security and intelligence.

There was no claim of responsibility for the early morning attack near Tel Aviv. The Israeli military claimed Hamas fired the rocket from about 120km, making it the longest-range attack from Gaza since the 2014 war.  
Hamas denied firing the rocket.

“None of the resistance movements, including Hamas, is interested in firing rockets from the Gaza Strip into the enemy,” an official said.

“The same message was handed over to Egypt, which has acted as a mediator between Israel and Hamas.” 

Netanyahu cut short a visit to the US to return home, as did his main election challenger, former military chief Benny Gantz. “Israel will not tolerate this. I will not tolerate this,” Netanyahu said after the rocket strike.

“And as we speak ... Israel is responding forcefully to this wanton aggression.”

The Israeli prime minister’s options are limited, analysts told Arab News. “He can go in the direction of a serious understanding with Hamas to end the siege of Gaza, or go in the direction of a large operation, but I do not think that would stop the fall of rockets on Israeli cities, as happened in the past,” the Hamas-affiliated political analyst Ibrahim Madhoun said.

“No one wants war, but Hamas cannot tolerate much more Israeli procrastination. If Egypt wants to succeed in its efforts to reach a truce, it should apply more pressure on Israel.”

A joint statement from militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, took responsibility for the barrage of rockets fired in response to the Israeli strikes later Monday night.

The rocket from Gaza that hit a house in Israel early Monday was a rare long-distance strike and Israel’s army said it was fired by Hamas.

The Israeli house hit was located in the community of Mishmeret, around 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Tel Aviv, police said.

The rocket would have had to travel some 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israel said it was fired from.

The hospital treating the wounded said seven Israelis were injured lightly by burns and shrapnel, including three children.

One of the wounded was a six-month-old child and six of them were members of the same British-Israeli family.

The house was destroyed in the wake of the rocket and subsequent fire, with burnt wood, a children’s toy and other debris piled at the site.

Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008, and Netanyahu is believed to want to avoid another one with unpredictable results ahead of the elections.

LONDON: Researchers at the American University in Cairo have identified a disturbing link between rising temperatures and increases in cases of breast, cervical, ovarian and uterine cancers among women in the Middle East and North Africa region.

The key message of a study that has identified “a significant correlation between prolonged exposure to high ambient temperatures and all four cancer types” is as simple as it is urgent, said Wafa Abu El-Kheir-Mataria, senior researcher at the Institute of Global Health and Human Ecology at the American University in Cairo.

“Our findings make it clear that climate change is not a distant or abstract threat. It is already impacting women’s health in tangible ways,” said Dr. Kheir-Mataria, co-author with Prof. Sungsoo Chun, associate director of the institute, of a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health.

“In the MENA region, rising temperatures are significantly correlated with increased prevalence and mortality of several cancers affecting women.”

![](https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/pictures/July/20/2025/infographic_climate_women_health.jpg)

She added: “This evidence highlights the urgent need to integrate climate risks into cancer control strategies today, not tomorrow.”

The study looked at 17 countries in the MENA region and examined how increasing average temperatures coincided with how often women were getting certain cancers and dying from them.

The connection between rising temperatures and increasing cases of the four types of cancer was found to be significant in just six countries — Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Syria and Jordan.

The finding that the four wealthy Gulf states featured significantly was a “very important observation,” said Dr. Kheir-Mataria, and one that merits urgent further investigation.

“The Gulf countries have some of the strongest healthcare systems in the region,” she said.

“However, what our findings may reflect is that even high-performing systems are now facing new, complex challenges brought about by climate change — challenges that may not yet be fully addressed within traditional cancer control strategies.”

#### DID YOU KNOW?

• Breast, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers are rising in parts of MENA as temperatures increase year on year.

• Even Gulf countries with strong health systems show above-average increases in cancer deaths linked to climate stress.

• Researchers say a 4 C rise by 2050 could amplify health risks, but more local studies are urgently needed.

The Gulf states, she added, “are also among those experiencing the most extreme and rapid increases in temperature, which can amplify environmental exposures that are not always visible or easily managed, such as air pollution or heat-related physiological stress.”

At the same time, “social and behavioral factors, like health-seeking behaviors or cultural barriers to early screening, may continue to influence outcomes despite strong system capacity.”

Dr Kheir-Mataria wants “more in-depth, country-specific research in countries such as Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Our study is an important starting point, but it has clear limitations. We worked with publicly available data and focused primarily on the relationship between temperature and cancer outcomes, while controlling for income.

“However, many other important factors such as air pollution levels, urban heat islands, occupational exposure, genetic predispositions, and healthcare utilization patterns were beyond the scope of this analysis.”

To fully understand all the factors at play, “we need access to more granular data and the opportunity to examine these additional variables in context.

“That’s why we are actively seeking local partnerships with research institutions, ministries of health, and environmental agencies and funding to support collaborative studies.”

The Gulf states, she said, “are uniquely positioned to lead the way in advancing global understanding of climate-related health risks, and we would be honored to work together to generate evidence that informs national policy and protects women’s health in the face of climate change.”

Meanwhile, it is necessary to “acknowledge that environmental stressors such as rising temperatures and air pollution can exacerbate cancer risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as women, and incorporate climate change adaptation into cancer control plans.”

Adaptation strategies “might include strengthening early detection and screening services in high-risk areas, ensuring healthcare facilities remain accessible during climate-related disruptions, and integrating environmental risk monitoring into public health planning.”

Dr Kheir-Mataria said this “involves cross-sectoral collaboration between health, environmental, and planning ministries to build climate resilient healthcare systems.”

The study combined two decades of data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation’s Global Burden of Disease with statistics on temperature change from the FAOSTAT Climate Change database of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, for every year from 1998 to 2019.

Applying a method of statistical analysis called multiple linear regression, which adjusted results to take account of socioeconomic differences between countries that might influence health outcomes, the researchers were able to identify “a clear pattern: where temperatures rose, cancer rates and deaths often rose too.”

This was expressed in the percentage increase in cases and deaths for each degree Celcius the temperature rose. For example, the largest increase in deaths was found in ovarian cancer, with an overall average increase across the 17 countries of 0.33 percentage points per degree.

But increased numbers of deaths from ovarian cancer were higher than average in Jordan and the UAE (both 0.48).

Although the overall increase in deaths from cervical cancer was the lowest of the four diseases (0.171), the increase was higher than average in Iran (0.3), Jordan (0.45), and Qatar (0.61).

In Saudi Arabia, significant increases in cases were detected in ovarian (0.29) and uterine (0.36) cancers. An above-average increase in deaths in the Kingdom was found in breast cancer (0.31). 

The paper points out that, with a temperature rise of 4 C expected by 2050, “the MENA region is particularly at risk due to global warming.”

In 2019, 175,707 women in the region died from cancer. But, Dr Kheir-Mataria said, it was not possible to simply multiply the study’s findings by four to predict the number of additional cancer deaths by 2050 related to rising temperatures.

“This is a question we fully understand the interest in, but we must be very careful not to overstate what our data can tell us,” she said.

“Our study found a statistical association between rising temperatures and cancer deaths among women. However, these are correlations, not predictions, and they were based on historical data over a specific period, with many other contributing factors.

“Projecting the number of additional deaths by 2050 based on a hypothetical 4 C rise would go beyond what our data allows, as it would require complex modelling that includes population growth, healthcare system changes, adaptation measures, and other environmental or behavioral variables.

“We did not conduct such a projection in this study, and doing so responsibly would require a separate research design.”

She added: “That said, the potential implications of a 4 C increase are certainly concerning, particularly in countries already experiencing extreme heat.

“This is why we strongly advocate for further research, including dynamic modelling and country-level analyses, to understand and prepare for the possible long-term health impacts of climate change, especially on women.”

Israeli military said late on Friday that it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen after air raid sirens sounded in several areas across Israel.  
The Iran-aligned Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have been firing at Israel and attacking shipping lanes.  
Houthis have repeatedly said that their attacks are an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel’s military assault since late 2023 has killed more than 58,000 people, Gaza authorities say.  
Most of the dozens of missiles and drones they have launched have been intercepted or fallen short. Israel has carried out a series of retaliatory strikes.

BAGHDAD: Drones used to attack military bases in Iraq during the recent Israel-Iran war were manufactured outside Iraq but were launched inside its territory, according to the “decisive findings” of an investigation published on Friday.  
The report of an investigative committee formed under the directive of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani did not identify who was behind the attacks that targeted radar and air defense systems last month.  
The attacks on several military bases, including some housing US troops, damaged radar systems at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province.  
Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman said the investigation had reached “decisive findings.”  
He said the drones used were manufactured outside Iraq but were launched from locations inside Iraqi territory. All drones used in the attacks were of the same type, indicating that a single actor was behind the entire campaign, he said.  
Al-Naaman said the investigation had identified the entities responsible for coordinating and executing the operations, but he did not name them.  
“Legal measures will be taken against all those involved, and they will be referred to the Iraqi judiciary to be held accountable in accordance with the law,” the statement said.  
Before the drone attacks, Iran-backed Iraqi militias had previously threatened to target American bases if the US attacked Iran. Some of the militias are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of armed groups that is officially under the command of the Iraqi military, although in practice they largely act independently.  
More recently, several oil fields in the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region have come under attack by drones, further exacerbating tensions between the central government and Kurdish authorities and raising concerns over the security of Iraq’s critical infrastructure.

*   Army says it ‘will not allow any violation of civil peace’ amid fears of widening tensions

BEIRUT: The Lebanese army said on Friday that it “will not allow any breach of security or violation of civil peace” amid fears that rising tensions in the neighboring Syrian Arab Republic could spread to Lebanon.

In a statement, the army added that “overcoming this phase requires the unity and solidarity of the Lebanese, awareness of the gravity of the situation, and their responsibility, and refraining from taking any action that would have unintended consequences for the security of the Lebanese.”

Towns and villages in Mount Lebanon, home to the Druze community, have witnessed attempts to block roads and assault Syrian workers in recent days following the renewed clashes in Sweida, Syria.

President Joseph Aoun chaired a meeting of security leaders on Friday.

A military source told Arab News: “The security, military, and intelligence agencies have taken the utmost caution and vigilance to thwart any attempt at sedition within Lebanon.”

Prime Minister Nawaf Salam spoke with Druze Sheikh Sami Abi Al-Mona and praised his “responsible role in calming tensions, quelling strife, and preserving civil peace in Lebanon,” according to Salam’s office.

The media office said the two sides stressed that “what is happening outside Lebanon’s borders should not be turned into a source of internal incitement.”

An extraordinary meeting of the Druze Religious Council in Lebanon concluded with former Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt calling for “an immediate ceasefire in Sweida in preparation for direct dialogue between the Syrian state and local actors.”

Jumblatt added that “Jabal Al-Arab is an integral part of Syria.”

He condemned the Israeli attacks on Syria and Lebanon, and called for the “formation of an investigation committee to uncover the crimes committed against the people of Sweida and the Bedouins.”

Al-Mona declared the council’s “full solidarity with our people in Sweida, and with the wounded and injured as a result of the recent unfortunate events.”

He called on “everyone to reject any divisive tendency,” and stressed “the need to adhere to the ceasefire agreement signed two days ago.”

Al-Mona denounced “the attack on Sunnis,” considering it a reaction.

“The council neither justifies nor accepts this type of action, whatever its reasons,” he said.

Al-Mona rejected any Israeli interference in Syrian affairs, calling on the international community to open a transparent investigation into the events and hold those responsible accountable. He also declared his rejection of “the spread of strife to Lebanon.”

The Grand Mufti of the Lebanese Republic, Sheikh Abdul Latif Derian, the highest religious authority in the Sunni sect, contacted Al-Mona, and both sides affirmed their “complete rejection of being drawn into any inflammatory rhetoric or covering up any provocative actions that would inflame sectarian tensions and give a false image of the relationship between the two sects.”

The two sides called for “avoiding falling into the trap of strife” and emphasized their “rejection of any foreign interventions and attacks that contribute to undermining the unity that has always governed the historical relationship between the two sects.”

Both called on “the Syrian state, the religious sheikhs of Jabal Al-Arab, religious authorities, religious figures, and tribes to work seriously and effectively to bring about an immediate end to the ongoing violence and to expel the extremists who, intentionally or unintentionally, contribute to the implementation of suspicious plans.”

Hamas armed wing says Israel blocking ceasefire and hostage release talks

GAZA CITY: The armed wing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday accused Israel of blocking a deal in talks for a temporary ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza.  
  
Abu Obaida, spokesman for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video statement that Hamas “always proposed a comprehensive deal that will return all the hostages at once.”  
  
But he said Israel “rejected what we proposed,” urging it to reconsider.  
  
“If the enemy remains obstinate in this round of negotiations we cannot guarantee a return to the partial-deal proposals — including the 10-prisoner (hostage) exchange offer,” he added.

!Trump should not forget the Russian hand behind the Houthis <image:635>

On March 15, US President Donald Trump [ordered](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-launches-strikes-against-yemens-houthis-warns-iran-2025-03-15/)
 large-scale airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. By the summer of 2024, the Houthis provided Russia with [hundreds of Yemenis](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-terrorist-designation-russias-yemen-strategy/)
 who were reportedly then forced into Russian military training. While the United States has sought to ensure freedom of navigation against Houthi attacks, so that global trade continues to flow, Russia has aided Houthi operations as a way to ratchet up problems for the United States and its allies and partners.

Trump and US negotiators should refrain from further coddling the Kremlin. What does this mean for Yemen, Iran, and beyond?](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react-trump-just-ordered-major-strikes-against-the-houthis-what-does-this-mean-for-yemen-iran-and-beyond/)

Image: Flames and smoke rise from the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which has been on fire since August 23, on the Red Sea, August 25, 2024. The Houthis, an armed, Iran-backed group that controls the most populous parts of Yemen, have carried out dozens of attacks against ships in the Red Sea since November 2023, causing disruptions to global shipping.

“Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114167864888304754)
 on Truth Social.

Trump went on to [emphasize](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-piles-pressure-yemens-houthis-with-new-airstrikes-2025-03-17/)
 that Iran would be held responsible for any future Houthi attacks: “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!”

The US president is right that Iran plays a large role in supporting the Houthis. Russia, too, is an important backer of the group.

Back in October 2024, the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-provided-targeting-data-for-houthi-assault-on-global-shipping-eabc2c2b)
 that Russia was providing targeting data to the Houthis, which they then used while attacking Western ships. In the fall of 2024, Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout was reportedly [attempting](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putins-merchant-of-death-is-back-in-the-arms-business-this-time-selling-to-the-houthis-10b7f521?mod=article_inline)
 to broker the sale of around ten million dollars’ worth of automatic small arms to the group. Iran was also [arbitrating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
 secret talks between Russia and the Houthis for transfers of anti-ship missiles to the militants."

===================================================================

New attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on cargo ships in the Red Sea have raised fears of a renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route for international trade

ByJON GAMBRELL Associated Press

July 8, 2025, 4:36 AM

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An attack by [Yemen’s Houthi rebels](https://apnews.com/hub/houthis)
 on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea killed three mariners and wounded two others, a European Union naval force said Tuesday, highlighting the danger of the group's [renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 for international trade.

The [attack on the Greek-owned Eternity C](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-houthis-israel-15edf75586540201f63b7c33348fb737)
 follows the Iranian-backed Houthis [attacking another vessel, the bulk carrier Magic Seas](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-ship-attacked-2f10bed442ebca4aa026b5dc67a05b76)
, on Sunday in the Red Sea that they said subsequently sank. The Houthis released a similar video after [their attack on the tanker Sounion in August 2024](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attack-sounion-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-76c68f18a984d18905ce7c84e5cabe0c)
.

The attack on the Magic Seas drew international criticism.

“It is the first such attack against a commercial vessel in 2025, a serious escalation endangering maritime security in a vital waterway for the region and the world,” the EU warned. The assaults are the first Houthi attacks on shipping since late 2024 on the waterway that had begun to see more ships pass through in recent weeks.

“We haven’t seen any real attacks on merchant shipping since December last year," said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. President Donald Trump’s administration [targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-278d07bc5aad75bb32e57f99a78cbe88)
.

The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following [U.S. The Houthis apparently targeted the two vessels over their companies running routes to Israel.

“If I were to venture, I guess it has to do with Netanyahu being in Washington and with the fact that, of, course, Iran and its network of allies has been taking a bit of a beating in the last couple of months,” Paes said.

The Houthis have been launching [missile and drone attacks](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c)
 against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an [effort to end](https://apnews.com/video/israel-hamas-war-yemen-red-sea-rebellions-and-uprisings-yemen-government-35148e6fbef64ec8b6fa074d4da2551c)
 Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and [killing four sailors](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba)
. then launched a broad assault against the rebels that [ended weeks later](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 when Trump said the rebels pledged to stop attacking ships.

Since then, the Houthis have continued occasional [missile attacks targeting Israel](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-gaza-aid-ship-attacks-0da6c2453fe2c4e5f81923c84c7d3f3a)
. The EU Operation Aspides and the private security firm Ambrey both reported those details.

While the Houthis haven't claimed the attack — they can take days to claim one — Yemen's exiled government and the EU force blamed the rebels, as did the U.S. State Department.

“These attacks demonstrate the ongoing threat that Iran-backed Houthi rebels pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. They can negatively impact the already [dire humanitarian situation](https://apnews.com/video/humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen-displacement-camps-worsens-after-wfp-halts-food-distribution-2fd6c11ad61d4047868648fb921c8b11)
 in Yemen.”

The United Nations condemned the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea and called on the rebels to comply with U.N. The Philippines said 17 Filipinos were on the Magic Seas and another 21 on the Eternity C.

The two attacks, and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday targeting the rebels, raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S."

Background
----------

### Houthis within Yemen

The Houthi movement is an [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
\-backed [Zaydi](/wiki/Zaydism "Zaydism")
 [Shia Islamist](/wiki/Shia_Islamism "Shia Islamism")
 militant organization that exercises _de facto_ control over parts of [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
, though it is not the country's internationally recognized government; the [Houthi takeover in Yemen](/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen "Houthi takeover in Yemen")
 in 2014 resulted in the group's acquisition of the capital city of [Sanaa](/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa")
, but the anti-Houthi [Presidential Leadership Council](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
 remains recognized by the international community as Yemen's legitimate government.[\[98\]](#cite_note-106)
 After this conflict grew into an ongoing [civil war](/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)")
, millions of residents were internally displaced, and a Saudi-led coalition responded by imposing a [blockade](/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen "Blockade of Yemen")
 of Yemen. Anyone who can do that can easily deny the connection between what is happening in the Red Sea and Gaza."[\[201\]](#cite_note-209)

### Operation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition

While the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them.[\[202\]](#cite_note-210)
[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 region.[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 The operation, codenamed [Operation Prosperity Guardian](/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian "Operation Prosperity Guardian")
,[\[204\]](#cite_note-212)
 was formally launched on 23 December 2023.[\[174\]](#cite_note-Gronholt-pedersen-182)
 It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf")
 and [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")
 during the "[Tanker War](/wiki/Tanker_War "Tanker War")
" of the 1980s,[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 and the ongoing maritime security operations of [Combined Task Force 153](/wiki/Combined_Task_Force_153 "Combined Task Force 153")
, the US Navy-led task force based in [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain")
.[\[162\]](#cite_note-Wintour2023-170)
 The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat [Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa](/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia")
, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats.[\[205\]](#cite_note-213)

#### Independent naval patrols for maritime security

France, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the [French frigate _Languedoc_](/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc "French frigate Languedoc")
 intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate [_Virginio Fasan_](/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_(F_591) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")
 under the Secure Mediterranean operation.[\[16\]](#cite_note-itdec-20)
 India has also sent two [_Kolkata_\-class destroyers](/wiki/Kolkata-class_destroyer "Kolkata-class destroyer")
 to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea.[\[20\]](#cite_note-HT19dec-24)

### Pro-Palestinian protests

Main article: [Gaza war protests](/wiki/Gaza_war_protests "Gaza war protests")

In mid-January 2024, reports indicated that pro-Palestinian demonstrators in London voiced support for Houthi militants."

[Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774) The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, and that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis)


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the Houthis were involved in military operations in international waters, specifically in the Red Sea, and that these operations continued into 2025. The evidence also indicates that Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against the Houthis and that a ceasefire was announced.

The ABC News article states that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships. However, the Wikipedia article mentions a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, which contradicts the claim of a final cessation of military operations.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. While there was a ceasefire and a pledge to stop attacking ships, the evidence also shows continued Houthi attacks. More information is needed to determine if the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations.

[Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774) The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, and that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the Houthis were involved in military operations in international waters, specifically in the Red Sea, and that these operations continued into 2025. The evidence also indicates that Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against the Houthis and that a ceasefire was announced.

The ABC News article states that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships. However, the Wikipedia article mentions a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport, which contradicts the claim of a final cessation of military operations.

Based on the provided evidence, the claim cannot be fully verified. While there was a ceasefire and a pledge to stop attacking ships, the evidence also shows continued Houthi attacks. More information is needed to determine if the Houthis announced the final cessation of their military operations.

From [Source](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/): Found exact image on website with title: Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily
Content: "

! <image:649>

The Middle East stands at a perilous crossroads today. The aggression of Israel against Gaza has reached unprecedented levels, with a magnitude of destruction that the world cannot ignore.

Backed tacitly—and at times openly—by the United States and many Western powers, Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has gone beyond the boundaries of defense, crossing into systemic devastation of civilian infrastructure, indiscriminate killings, and collective punishment of the Palestinian people.

These actions, justified under the pretext of security, echo the darker chapters of history where power was exercised without restraint and conscience.

**The Israeli Assault on Gaza: A Crisis of Humanity**

Since the renewed escalation in Gaza began, thousands of innocent civilians—many of them women and children—have been killed. Homes, hospitals, schools, and places of worship have been flattened.

Access to water, food, and medical aid is systematically obstructed, creating a humanitarian catastrophe of colossal proportions. The siege on Gaza has become a global symbol of suffering and injustice, where international laws and human rights conventions appear suspended in favor of military dominance.

The Israeli government, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a coalition of ultra nationalists, has dismissed calls for ceasefire, deflected international investigations, and labeled every act of resistance as terrorism, while justifying its own excessive use of force as “defense.”

Yet, what is unfolding in Gaza is not just a military operation—it is a deliberate strategy of attrition, designed to break the Palestinian will and erase their claim to dignity, land, and nationhood.

Shockingly, despite global outrage, Benjamin Netanyahu has been formally accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes committed during the Gaza operations. The very fact that such charges could be brought against a sitting head of government should prompt global action.

Yet, Netanyahu walks free—welcomed in Western capitals, unimpeded in his travels, treated with deference by media and political elites. Where is the international community’s commitment to justice? Who shields him from arrest and prosecution?

The answer is plain: a coalition of powerful nations, led by the United States and certain European allies, who selectively uphold international law when it suits their strategic interests. This duality corrodes the very foundations of global order.

**The Role of the United States and the West: Complicity Through Silence and Support**

It is no secret that the United States remains Israel’s most powerful ally, providing billions in military aid, advanced weapons systems, and unwavering political cover at international forums like the United Nations.

European countries, though more cautious in language, have largely refrained from decisive action. The so-called liberal democracies, which so often preach about human rights and international order, have failed the people of Gaza.

The silence of Western governments, or worse, their implicit support, sends a dangerous message: that some lives are worth more than others, and that military power justifies any action, no matter how barbaric. This hypocrisy not only undermines the credibility of the international system but also sows the seeds of long-term instability and global resentment.

**The Iranian Factor: A Strategic Counterbalance Emerges**

Amid this devastation, Iran has emerged as a key regional power capable of altering the balance. Despite years of sanctions, sabotage, and geopolitical isolation, Iran has built a formidable network of allied forces across the region—Hezbollah in Lebanon, various Iraqi militia groups, the Houthis in Yemen, and even influence among certain Syrian factions.

Its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has grown into one of the most sophisticated non-NATO military forces in the world, with capabilities in drones, missiles, cyber warfare, and unconventional tactics.

Iran’s response to Israeli aggression has been measured but symbolically powerful. The April 2024 drone and missile operation targeting Israeli military installations was unprecedented, demonstrating both capability and intent.

While most of the drones were intercepted, the sheer scale and precision shocked Western and Israeli military planners. Iran, once thought to be only a shadow power, has shown it can act—and when it does, it shakes the entire region.

More importantly, Iran’s growing influence across the Muslim world is ideological as much as it is military. It presents itself as a resistance power, willing to stand up against Western hegemony and Israeli expansionism, echoing the spirit of its 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah.

That revolution was not merely political—it was a deeply symbolic rejection of Western control over Muslim lands, a theme that resonates even more today as Palestinians bleed and the world watches.

**History Repeats: The West Should Remember Vietnam and the Shah**

The United States must recall its past mistakes. It was defeated in Vietnam despite possessing overwhelming military power. The Vietnamese people, driven by nationalism and resilience, made the cost of occupation unbearable.

Similarly, America’s alliance with the Shah of Iran crumbled when the Iranian people rose up, rejecting a regime seen as a puppet of U.S. interests. Today, the same forces of resistance and rebellion are stirring in the Middle East, driven by years of humiliation, occupation, and betrayal.

No amount of weapons, propaganda, or diplomatic maneuvering can extinguish a people’s desire for freedom and justice. If America continues on its current path—arming Israel, ignoring war crimes, and demonizing any form of resistance—it will not only lose moral credibility, but also geopolitical stability across a region critical to the world’s energy and security architecture.

**A Turning Point for the Middle East**

What we are witnessing now is not merely another round of violence. It is a reckoning. Israel’s unrestrained military campaign, with Western backing, is catalyzing a new realignment of forces. Iran and its allies may be viewed with suspicion by the West, but to many across the region, they represent strength in the face of imperial arrogance. This should be a moment of serious reflection for Western powers.

The people of Gaza deserve peace, dignity, and a future free from siege and war. The people of Israel deserve security, but not at the cost of another nation’s annihilation. And the world deserves a Middle East that is just, not merely stable for the sake of oil and arms.

The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice—provided we do not look away when justice is being strangled in plain sight."

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:8>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:8> of an explosion over a city at night is found on multiple websites. One source, "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)", labels the image as "A picture of the raid that targeted the Al-Laylaki area a short while ago" and dates it October 22, 2024 <image:645>.

Another source, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", also contains the image with the same label and date <image:648>. The image is also found on "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)" <image:649>.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Israel attacking Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. The image is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, and is labeled as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area.

The evidence suggests the image depicts an event that occurred on October 22, 2024, not October 26, 2024, as the claim states. The evidence also does not mention Israel or Iranian military targets.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, and is labeled as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area. The claim states the image shows an event on October 26, 2024, and mentions Israel attacking Iranian military targets, which is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, as evidenced by sources like "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)" and "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max/)", which label it as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area. The claim's assertion of an October 26, 2024, event involving Israel and Iranian military targets is not supported by the available evidence.

Iran’s Kamikaze Doctrine: Strategic Suicide as Deterrence
=========================================================

What we face is not a rational regime seeking security guarantees but rather a regime that sees annihilation as a legitimate instrument of statecraft.

#### Table of Contents

When speaking of Iran’s strategic posture, too often the discussion falls into the binary of containment versus confrontation, diplomacy versus deterrence. What this debate fails to grasp is the very premise upon which the Islamic Republic has anchored its security doctrine – a doctrine not based on survivability, but on martyrdom. The regime’s internal strategic rationale is not just ideological, it is apocalyptic. Nowhere is this more evident than in what Iranian insiders have termed the “Kamikaze protocol” – a doctrine of deliberate national self-sabotage in the event of existential threat.

This doctrine is more than just a contingency plan. It is a message: if the regime falls, the nation falls with it.

During my time in Iran, I was privy to high-level discussions in which regime officials outlined a chilling scenario. Should Israel and its allies engage in a concerted campaign to dismantle the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and threaten the leadership’s hold over the state apparatus, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has provisioned for maximum harm to be exacted within Iran’s borders.

This is not military defense in the conventional sense – it is calculated annihilation. Critical infrastructure, including oil refineries, dams, energy hubs, and even civilian urban centers, have reportedly been seeded with strategic weaponry and chemical agents. These are not “booby-traps” in the literal sense, but they serve a dual-use function: to be activated by IRGC operatives in acts of sabotage, or to become targets for foreign powers in a way that can be weaponized in the court of public opinion.

The aim is threefold: ensure maximum civilian casualties, provoke environmental collapse, and – most cynically – blame Jerusalem. The regime, even in its death throes, seeks to control the narrative.

This strategic nihilism is not a theoretical exercise. Iran has already demonstrated the infrastructure and intent to pursue such operations. In June 2020, a string of unexplained explosions and fires targeted military and nuclear facilities across Iran, including the Natanz enrichment site. Official obfuscation followed, but independent intelligence agencies pointed to a combination of internal sabotage and foreign cyber operations.

In January 2023, Isfahan’s ammunition factory was struck by drones, followed by oil refinery explosions in Tabriz. The pattern is unmistakable: Iran’s sensitive sites are not only militarized, but increasingly vulnerable. The more concerning inference is that the regime anticipates this vulnerability – and has turned it into policy.

Furthermore, the 2019 Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, attributed to the IRGC’s naval units, illustrate how easily the regime deploys false-flag operations. In the Kamikaze scenario, such tactics would be scaled domestically: a sabotaged refinery or breached dam would be pinned on Israeli or American intervention, thereby justifying retaliatory strikes and securing the regime’s ideological legitimacy in the eyes of its proxies.

The logic of the Kamikaze protocol dictates that key infrastructure across Iran is pre-selected for weaponization. From the sprawling Karun-3 and Dez dams in the southwest, whose destruction could trigger devastating floods, to the Abadan oil refinery – one of the oldest and largest in the region – each of these locations offers a uniquely catastrophic potential. In the event of sabotage or direct attack, the resulting fires, toxic releases, and energy grid collapse could plunge Iran into weeks of darkness and chaos. The same is true for chemical facilities near Damghan and the military-industrial complexes surrounding Parchin, long suspected of dual-use research involving chemical and possibly biological agents. Sabotage at these locations could result in a humanitarian disaster that extends beyond national borders.

Equally concerning is the vulnerability of Iran’s power generation and nuclear infrastructure, particularly around Isfahan and Bushehr. Targeting these sites – either through regime sabotage or as a response to IRGC provocations – would serve both tactical and propaganda purposes. Finally, Iran’s southern ports, notably Shahid Rajaee and Bandar Abbas, which are vital nodes for both commerce and IRGC maritime operations, could be turned into theaters of economic strangulation. Taken together, these vulnerabilities outline a regime prepared to transform the country into a giant trap, waiting to be sprung should its survival be threatened.

Yet, despite these signals, Western powers continue to operate under the dangerous illusion that the Islamic Republic can be moderated through incentives and diplomatic engagement. This is a profound misreading of the regime’s ideological DNA. Iran’s leaders are not irrational, but they are operating from a strategic paradigm where deterrence is achieved not through survivability, but through the threat of martyrdom on a national scale.

This makes Iran fundamentally different from other authoritarian regimes. Its willingness to exact harm upon its own citizens to preserve the regime’s religious and political hegemony renders containment not merely ineffective, but complicit.

It is time to move beyond euphemisms and half-measures. The Kamikaze protocol must be publicly exposed as a strategy of state-orchestrated mass suicide. By shedding light on this doctrine, the international community can begin to puncture its utility. Secrecy, after all, is the oxygen of such plans. Once exposed, their potency diminishes.

Disruption, not dialogue, must be the strategic compass. Covert operations – whether cyber or kinetic – should focus on neutralizing command-and-control structures and dismantling the logistical backbone of the IRGC. These actions need not be declared; they need only be effective. Simultaneously, regional cooperation must be elevated. Gulf States such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, long targeted by Tehran’s proxies, should be integrated into a broader intelligence and civil contingency alliance.

Meanwhile, civilian defense must evolve. Western powers, in coordination with Iran’s neighbors, ought to develop rapid environmental response units capable of addressing dam breaches, chemical contamination, and infrastructure sabotage. This is no longer a theoretical exercise but a necessary precaution in light of what the regime has threatened to unleash.

The legal arena, too, must not be ignored. International bodies must begin documenting and preparing the groundwork for accountability under the Chemical Weapons Convention and other arms control frameworks. Should evidence emerge of chemical weapons deployments tied to civilian infrastructure, the culpability must be clear and unambiguous.

What we face is not a rational regime seeking security guarantees. We face a regime that sees annihilation as a legitimate instrument of statecraft. The Kamikaze protocol is not a last resort – it is a foundational pillar of the regime’s strategic imagination. It is time we recalibrated our own.

Containment has become collusion. Dialogue has become denial. Only through exposing, disrupting, and disarming Iran’s apparatus of self-destruction can we prevent the greatest tragedy of all: a regime that, true to its apocalyptic vision, burns the house down rather than see it occupied by another.

Canada investigating Israeli-Canadian IDF soldiers?

JCFA senior researcher, Amb. Alan Baker slams the probe as a “political PR stunt with no legal basis.” “This isn’t justice—it’s a betrayal. Canada is siding with PLO propaganda over facts.”

Israel pounded Iran with a series of airstrikes early Saturday. While Israel said that it was targeting military sites in retaliation for the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon the country earlier this month, Iran said that the attack could only cause 'limited damage'.

Explosions were heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, as dozens of Israeli Air Force aircraft, including fighter jets, refuelers, and spy planes, pounded Iran. Videos being shared on social media platforms blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defense systems around the city.

Iran's military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces and caused "limited damage," without elaborating further.

Israel's hourslong attack ended just before sunrise in Tehran, with the Israeli military saying it targeted "missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year." It also said it hit surface-to-air missile sties and "additional Iranian aerial capabilities."

Iran had launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on the evening of October 1, sending Israelis scrambling into bomb shelters but causing only minimal damage and a few injuries. Israel said that the Saturday strikes was in retaliation to October 1 attack.

About October 1 attack, Iran said the barrage was retaliation for attacks in recent months that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately said Iran had "made a big mistake."

The attack also marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq.

Meanwhile, the United States warned Iran against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire in Middle East

BEIRUT — Israel's military announced Sunday it is now taking aim at the Lebanon-based Hezbollah's financial arm and will attack a “large number of targets” in Beirut and elsewhere. Explosions began in Beirut's southern suburbs about an hour later.

Evacuation warnings affected southern Beirut, the eastern Bekaa valley and parts of southern Lebanon. AP video showed strikes near Lebanon’s only airport but it continued to operate.

The strikes will target al-Qard al-Hassan "all over Lebanon,” a senior Israeli intelligence official said. <image:3582>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

“AQAH is a cash-based organization. A stream of people left the areas surrounding its branches in Beirut.

In one evacuation notice, for the Choueifat area south of Beirut, the Israeli military mislabeled one target, causing confusion and panic. The location was labeled as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in an upscale shopping mall in central Beirut more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.

A year of escalating tensions and frequent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the war in Gaza turned into all-out war last month. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called civilian casualties in Lebanon “far too high” in the Israel-Hezbollah war, and urged Israel to scale back some strikes, especially in and around Beirut."

Massive blasts in Beirut after renewed Israeli air strikes

Moment giant explosions seen near Beirut airport

Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah.

The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. <image:3584>!Map showing southern Lebanese towns and villages affected by Israeli military evacuation orders (3 October 2024) <image:3585>

The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety.

Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border.

Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.

Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”.

“There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside.”

Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15.

'It's still a scene of chaos' - BBC reporter outside Beirut building hit by Israeli strike

Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. <image:3584>!Dean Sweetland, who lives in a kibbutz on Israel's northern border with Lebanon <image:3587>

Dean Sweetland said his house near Israel's northern border shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon

Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil.

He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead.

“We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war.

“But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?”

“It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.”

New Delhi,UPDATED: Oct 24, 2024 21:24 IST

Middle East Airlines is the [**only commercial airline still operating**](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/23/lebanons-middle-east-airlines-keeps-flying-despite-conflict)
 in conflict-ridden Beirut as Israeli air strikes continue in southern Lebanon. The airline reportedly conducts daily assessments to ensure the safety of operations amid the risk of air raids.

Now, a [**photo**](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161814286500561&set=a.10150103235465561)
 allegedly showing an MEA flight landing with a [**huge explosion in the backdrop**](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10225654114370781&set=a.10223699930077395)
 has gone viral. Many shared the [**photo**](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1070414411443476)
 with captions like, “A photo for the history books. MEA airline landing in Beirut International Airport as Israeli rains fire on the airport.”

India Today Fact Check, however, found that this photo is AI-generated.

**Our Probe**

Reverse searching the photo led us to an [**Instagram post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 dated October 21. Along with the viral photo, the post contained another similar picture of a flight landing amid an explosion. The caption of the post stated that these photos were generated using AI, crediting another [**Instagram account**](https://www.instagram.com/south.to.north/)
 named “@south.to.north”.

While we could not find the viral photo on this account, we have reached out to them for more information.

> 
> [A post shared by Lebanon ðŸ‡ñðŸ‡ç (@south.to.north)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBW7c34sw3t/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

We also compared the flight seen in the viral photo with photos of MEA flights. We noticed several discrepancies in the aeroplane, such as the design of the tail and the blurred-out portion of the plane's body. A comparison between the two can be seen below.

![Beirut Fight AI 2](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/pic%203_0.jpg?VersionId=NMiX7NUvKvgl0_prPvNCLFNqdlPBpWvW&size=750:*)

We used the AI detection tool [**Hive Moderation**](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection)
, which stated there was a 91.7 per cent chance of it being generated using AI. Another such tool called [**TrueMedia**](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=97aaZmk9bGxIGiVd1a6P8BI0id4.jpg&post=jDH7HdTrOn7f9ZP0/22Z4w==)
 stated there was substantial evidence of generative AI being used to create the photo.

![Beirut Fight AI 3](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/pic%204.png?VersionId=SrNivwj6LZa81tvTZM9PAyDlKjZxlnYE)

Notably, as per news reports, Captain Mohammed Aziz, an adviser to the MEA chairman, recently [**stated**](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3283486/lebanons-national-airline-braves-israeli-air-strikes-beirut)
 that some of the most dramatic photos of jets landing in fiery hellscapes were generated using AI, adding that they will only operate as long as the threat assessment marks it safe.

It is thus, clear that the viral photo of an aeroplane landing amid explosions was AI-generated.

A post going viral on social media ([here](https://www.facebook.com/izzath.jamaldeen/posts/pfbid0i8bX8jwxbWQQbYf7naCo56yQGeg8b9SxBgB9gTjGk1AnfF9frpgdga9eL2rSco3wl?rdid=SCWXYlDOGV1CI6wT)

) claims to show a Middle East Airlines (MEA) plane landing at Beirut International Airport while Israeli forces rain fire on the airport. This post is shared amid the ongoing tensions between [Israel and Lebanon](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-war-pager-explosion-explained/article68676755.ece)
. Let’s verify the claim through this article.

> **Claim:** A picture shows a Middle East Airlines (MEA) plane landing at Beirut International Airport, surrounded by massive fire and smoke.
> 
> **Fact**: The viral image is AI-generated and does not show a real incident from Beirut International Airport. It was uploaded on the Instagram account “eyesoflebanon” on 21 October 2024, with a caption confirming it as an AI-generated image. We also analyzed the image using different AI Detector tools, which confirmed that the image is AI-generated. Hence, the claim made in the post is **FALSE**.

A reverse image search of the viral image’s screenshot led us to a [similar](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 [image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 uploaded on an Instagram handle named “eyesoflebanon” on 21 October 2024. The caption of the post revealed that this is an AI-generated image.

! <image:322>

Along with this image, the user shared another [AI-generated image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=2)
 allegedly depicting the same incident.

! <image:323>

We then used [Hive AI detector](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection)
  to analyze the image, which confirmed that it was 96.4% AI-generated.

! <image:324>

To further verify, we used another tool, [True Media AI detector,](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=38NoMveZlzSGuJ-nUilOMydg0gY.jpg&post=mr90LSTgA0qEyzmf8n6LpA==)
 which also indicated that the image was created with the help of artificial intelligence.

! <image:325>

To sum up, an AI-generated image of a plane landing at Beirut International Airport surrounded by fire and smoke is falsely shared as real.

Summary 2024/8  
19 July 2024  
Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem Summary of the Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024  
Chronology of the procedure (paras 1-21)  
The Court first recalls that on 19 January 2023, the Secretary-General of the United Nations officially communicated to the Court the decision taken by the General Assembly to submit the questions set forth in resolution 77/247 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (hereinafter the “General Assembly”) on 30 December 2022. Decides, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, to request the International Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion on the following questions, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the advisory opinion of the Court of 9 July 2004:  
(a) What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures? 
The Court emphasizes that the conclusion that Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal does not release it from its obligations and responsibilities under international law, particularly the law of occupation, towards the Palestinian population and towards other States in respect of the exercise of its powers in relation to the territory until such time as its presence is brought to an end. 
On 10 June 2024, the Security Council adopted resolution 2735 (2024), whereby it reiterated  
“its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and in this regard stresse\[d\] the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”. If and to the extent that the Court finds that any of Israel’s policies and practices, or its continued presence, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are contrary to international law, the Court indicates that it will examine the legal consequences flowing from such findings for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. The Court therefore addresses the legal consequences arising from Israel’s policies and practices referred to in question (a) for Israel, together with those arising from the illegality of Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory under question (b), for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. 273-279)  
The Court then turns to the legal consequences of Israel’s internationally wrongful acts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as regards other States. 
With regard to the right to self-determination, the Court considers that, while it is for the General Assembly and the Security Council to pronounce on the modalities required to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, all States must co-operate with the United Nations to put those modalities into effect. It is for all States, while respecting the Charter of the United Nations and international law, to ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the exercise of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. 285) reads as follows:  
For these reasons,  
THE COURT,  
(1) Unanimously,  
Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested;  
(2) By fourteen votes to one,  
Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion;

**The situation in the Middle East**

**Advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and from the illegality of the continued presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Report of the Secretary-General**

### **I. I recognize that the 19 July 2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, requested by the General Assembly in December 2022, was rendered in a drastically different context – nine months after the horrifying 7 October 2023 attacks, which dramatically altered the dynamics for Israelis and Palestinians. On 16 October, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) sent a note verbale to the Permanent Missions of all Member States, the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine and all observers of the General Assembly in Geneva inviting them to share their views on proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion, in accordance with paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES-10/14](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185702/)
    _. Legal measures seeking accountability for violations of international law as mentioned in the responses received from Member States and observers include the following:

*   Providing written or oral submissions in support of ongoing legal proceedings that seek accountability for violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in the International Court of Justice, and ensuring cooperation with the International Criminal Court
*   Supporting the establishment of an “international register of damage” as provided for in paragraph 10 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _
*   Advocating for reparations for damages, loss or injury arising from the internationally wrongful acts of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
*   Strengthening legislative frameworks to support Palestinian self-determination and carrying out legal actions for violations of international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, through domestic and international courts.

### **IV. In paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Member States with relevant experience and expertise, to present proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion.

World Leaders Must Act to End Israel’s Unlawful Presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
==============================================================================================

21 April 2025

[Open Letter](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/?s=&filter[]=open-letter&tax=publication_type#search)

Over six months have passed since the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly [voted in favour](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154496)
 of adopting a resolution that gave effect to the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) July 2024 Advisory Opinion, stating that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence” in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) within 12 months. Rather than complying, Israel has intensified its violence in the West Bank and renewed its blockade and military bombardment of Gaza, breaking a fragile two-month ceasefire and further exacerbating the human-made humanitarian crisis.

We, the undersigned organisations, call upon global leaders to uphold their legal and moral responsibilities in light of the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion and the UN General Assembly resolution. 

The ICJ affirmed that Israel’s occupation of the oPt (the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza) is illegal under international law, and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations, including restitution and compensation. Any actions that obstruct the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance to the civilian population not only result in widespread loss of life and suffering, but also contribute to further entrenchment of Israel’s unlawful presence. 

**The Time for Action is Now**

We urge all states to take concrete steps to uphold the ICJ’s findings and to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal occupation. The continued impunity for Israel’s violations only exacerbates the suffering of the Palestinian people and undermines the rule of international law. 

We also call on states to urgently take decisive actions to enforce an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 446: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Mozambique and Children and Armed Conflict\

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gcr2p) The ICJ also confirmed that Israel’s policies breach the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid; reaffirmed the Palestinian right to self-determination; and declared Israel’s prolonged annexationist occupation an internationally wrongful act.

**The Dire Humanitarian Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory**

The humanitarian situation in the oPt was dire even before October 2023, marked by Israel’s prolonged blockade of Gaza, severe restrictions on movement, and excessive use of force in the West Bank. **Hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law.**
3. All states are legally bound to recognise Israel’s presence in the oPt as unlawful, not aid Israel in maintaining it, and cooperate to end this situation. Since then, in Gaza, Israel’s military assault has displaced nearly 90% of Palestinians, destroyed entire neighbourhoods, and created catastrophic conditions, with people surviving in makeshift shelters with little access to water or medical care, and pushed to the brink of famine. 

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, intensified Israeli military assaults, unlawful use of force, mass arrests, and settler violence have led to a rise in killings, massive scale forcible transfer, and severe restrictions on movement. The escalation of military attacks is not just sporadic violence or isolated policies, but reflects a strategy of annexation by Israeli authorities."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ made a ruling in July 2024 regarding Israel's actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel was declared an "illegal state." Instead, the ICJ found Israel's *presence* unlawful.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The ICJ did rule on the matter in July 2024, but the specific wording of the claim is not entirely supported by the evidence.

In a shocking incident in the National Capital Region, a young man, Ashu, suffered severe burns when his toilet exploded. His father, Sunil Pradhan, reported that Ashu sustained 35% burns and was hospitalized. Authorities suspect methane gas buildup from clogged drains as the cause, though the spark's origin remains unclear.

A bizarre and frightening accident took place in the National Capital Region of the country, when a usual visit to the bathroom turned into a nightmare for a young man who suffered some serious injuries as his home’s toilet exploded!Ashu’s father, Sunil Pradhan, described the horrifying moment, “The blast left Ashu with severe burn injuries to his face and body. He was rushed to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, where doctors confirmed he had suffered 35% burns,” said a TOI report. Importantly, he clarified that Ashu wasn’t using any mobile phone or electronic gadget at the time, ruling out some common theories like gadget explosions.While this might sound like something from a bizarre news column, this kind of accident could actually happen anywhere, especially in homes with aging or poorly maintained plumbing systems.

Poll

Do you believe that regular maintenance of plumbing systems can prevent accidents like toilet explosions?

Yes, absolutelyNo, it's not necessary

What really happened?  

------------------------

According to early assessments, the explosion was not triggered by electrical issues. The home’s air conditioning and all other appliances were functioning properly at the time. But the real reason behind this blast was the least expected but potentially dangerous cause, the methane gas buildup.The family suspects that methane may have accumulated inside the toilet bowl due to a clogged drain, and a spark might have ignited the gas, leading to the explosion, though the source of the spark is unclear.

![Representative Image](https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms)

Local resident Harinder Bhati shared his concerns, saying, “Pipes here are not just old, but they haven’t been cleaned in years. Choked pipes can lead to the accumulation of gas, which can explode under pressure.” This sentiment was echoed by experts, including a chemistry professor, who explained that methane can indeed collect in sewer lines and confined bathroom spaces, particularly where ventilation is poor or drains are blocked.Despite the alarming nature of the incident, AP Verma, a senior manager of the Greater Noida Authority, stated, “The system is clean and functioning normally. It appears that the explosion might have resulted from some internal problem within the house.” However, he did not clarify what those internal problems could be.

Why could this happen anywhere?  

----------------------------------

This incident is a wake-up call about how aging plumbing, poor ventilation, and neglected sewage maintenance can create dangerous conditions even in modern homes. While such explosions are rare, it is advised that homeowners regularly inspect and clean their plumbing systems, especially in older buildings, to prevent dangerous gas buildup.

This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

Spigel Sohmer senior partner Neil Oberman has served Mayor Valérie Plante by bailiff regarding electronic signs normally used in construction areas that were used by pro-Palestinian activists to convey anti-Israel hate messages.

Oberman, who is also the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, is acting on behalf of Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi, who, amongst others, called attention to the road construction signs, which say "Free Palestine. The hate propaganda is a by-product of your inaction."

Oberman wrote that his client, Levi, "contends that your negligence has enabled the spread of hate and violence on the island of Montreal, which is targeted against the citizens of Montreal."

The letter demands that Plante:

• Launch a "full investigation into the hate propaganda and that the same be made public."

• "Issue a letter of apology to the residents of Hampstead."

• Reveal "what measures \[will be taken\] so that hate is not supported nor tolerated by the City of Montreal and/or the use of its assets to do the same."

• "Confirm that the City of Montreal will investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the hate propaganda without delay." Otherwise, "our client will take the appropriate steps in law to safeguard the interests of his residents."

*   #### [Power couple Alex Carrier of the Habs and Dr. Valérie Plante needs to take concrete action."

Police are investigating the incident, credit for which was claimed by a group called Clash MTL. Oberman's letter, copied to Plante's Special Counsel Jimmy Zoubris and Montreal police chief Fady Dagher, says the electronic signs were used to call for violence and convey radical political messages.

The lawyer reminded Plante that this past February, he wrote to her on behalf of concerned citizens "regarding your administration's failure to act against the unlawful assemblies, aggression and violence that have infested the city of Montreal. Escalate Now" and "Globalize the Intifada."

"I refuse to stand by and watch my city descend into chaos and anarchy," Levi posted on X.The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs posted, "after 10 months of escalating anti-Jewish hate and glorification of violence, Montrealers deserve to feel safe and protected in their city. Montreal is denying responsibility, saying the signs belong to a private contractor. "Your inaction in this regard accomplished nothing other than to promote anarchy and the erosion of the rule of law in Montreal. Your inaction and incompetence have allowed anarchy to spread and damage the reputation and security of Montreal, Quebec and Canada."

Montreal mayor, police chief defend officers after weekend anti-NATO protest vandalism
======================================================================================

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions of protesters and defended police after chaos broke out at a demonstration Friday evening against the NATO Parliamentary Assembly taking place in the city.

'The images from Friday are shocking: people breaking windows, torching vehicles,' said Valérie Plante

Monday afternoon, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante denounced violence at an anti-NATO demonstration that took place Friday evening. (Radio-Canada)

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions of protesters and defended police after chaos broke out at a demonstration Friday evening against the NATO Parliamentary Assembly taking place in the city.

Plante held a news conference Monday afternoon, saying Montreal police officers have attended nearly 500 protests since the war in Gaza began last fall.

"The images from Friday are shocking: people breaking windows, torching vehicles," Plante said. She accused them of co-opting the protests to carry out violence and said more arrests are expected once police examine more footage from the events.

No place for hate at protests: Trudeau
--------------------------------------

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the protests on Monday. 

"In democracy, we will always defend freedom of expression, of protesting, of expressing our opposition on certain positions, but there is never place for violence, for hate or intimidation," Trudeau told reporters. 

On Saturday, on X, Trudeau called what happened "appalling."

"Acts of antisemitism, intimidation and violence must be condemned wherever we see them," he wrote.

He said the RCMP was in touch with local police, adding "there must be consequences and rioters held accountable."

Montreal rioters should be pursued to full extent of the law, Trudeau says

9 months ago

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opened his remarks at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Montreal, the location of violent anti-NATO protests over the weekend, by saying while people have the right to demonstrate there should never be any violence, and he expects 'those responsible to be pursued and punished under the full extent of the law.'

Over the weekend, Montreal police said they have not received any reports of antisemitic acts or other hate crimes related to the demonstration.

Plante was asked Monday whether Friday's protests were antisemitic, but she said she did not believe they were. 

The mayor noted that the _Service de police de la Ville de Montréal_ (SPVM) is the only police service in the province to have received special training on crowd management, terrorist attacks and cybersecurity. 

"I'm extremely proud of the police force we have here in Montreal. All three were released and will appear in court at a later date.

At least 3 arrested after anti-NATO, pro-Palestinian protests in Montreal

9 months ago

Montreal police say at least three people were arrested after anti-NATO and pro-Palestinian demonstrators converged in the city's downtown core, with protesters throwing objects at police, lighting two vehicles on fire and breaking windows.

The protest, organized by the Divest for Palestine collective and anti-capitalist group CLAC, was meant to denounce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as the city hosts the 70th annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from Nov. 22 to 25.

Organizers said the purpose of the protest was to demonstrate against what he called NATO's "complicity with Israel's military while it's conducting its genocide in Gaza." They also pointed to "war crimes in Lebanon, Syria" and other injustices in the region.

While Canada and the United States are NATO members, Israel is not.

Plante blamed the property damage on what she called "professional vandals" who she said are known to police. The work will continue," Plante said.

In an interview with [Radio-Canada's morning radio program](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/ohdio/premiere/emissions/1124/tout-un-matin)
 _[Tout un matin](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/ohdio/premiere/emissions/1124/tout-un-matin)
,_ Dagher said the chaos only lasted about five minutes. 

"It's as if we played a spotless hockey season but all that's talked about is the one goal that went through," Dagher said, after noting the hundreds of demonstrations Montreal police have watched over in the past year.

now "We have to reiterate loud and clear that gestures or words like we saw over the weekend have no place in Montreal. Protesting is a fundamental right, but not to the detriment of other communities."

Montreal police say at least three people were arrested after pro-Palestinian and anti-NATO demonstrators turned violent, with protesters throwing objects at police, lighting two vehicles on fire and breaking windows.

Police say they arrested a 22-year-old woman for obstructing police work and assaulting a police officer, as well as two men, 22 and 28, both for obstructing police work."

Graphic assembled by The Maple staff.

The City of Montreal is facing legal action after its employees were caught on camera tearing down pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election.

The signs belonged to LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), which is legally [registered](https://www.elections.ca/WPAPPS/WPR/EN/TP?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a third-party campaign group in the upcoming LaSalle—Émard—Verdun by-election, taking place on September 16.

The incident is the third time since 2008 that the City of Montreal inappropriately removed election signs belonging to Palestine solidarity groups and pro-Palestine political parties, raising questions about why such signs are being targeted.

LEV4P sent a cease and desist letter to the City on August 2. He pointed out that the City was [ordered](https://thecjn.ca/news/bds-group-awarded-damages-for-election-poster-removal/?ref=readthemaple.com)
 to pay $12,860 in punitive damages in 2018 for a similar incident involving pro-Palestine signs displayed by registered groups back in 2015.

“There’s no more good faith argument when it’s the third time, and when you’ve had a judge severely criticize you for this,” said Johnson.

LEV4P raised and spent approximately $3,000 on the signs, and those torn down by City workers on camera represented only a fraction of those that were distributed throughout the riding — before they were taken down. 

The signs highlighted Canada’s complicity in Israel’s war on Gaza, which is being [examined](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a case of genocide at the International Court of Justice, as well as more generic slogans calling for a free Palestine.

After the City admitted removing some of the signs, it returned 95 signs out of a total of 450. Johnson said that his clients could not simply replace the signs before getting them back from the City since they would be in danger of exceeding third-party spending limits.

In his view, this means the damage has already been done to the democratic process.

“This new violation which the City of Montreal has committed is so serious, and the effect that it can have is a sort of chilling effect,” Johnson explained. 

“That’s the danger when public authorities intervene to limit freedom of speech: It can undermine people’s confidence in our democracy. “I don’t think that is a defence that will hold up in court.”

In an emailed statement sent in French and translated into English by The Maple using an online tool, the City of Montreal said it would not comment on the matter due to the possibility of legal action.

“The City confirms having received a copy of the formal notice from the Lasalle-Émard-Verdun organization for Palestine,” the City said. “To me, it is motivated by the message on our signs.”

Canada’s role in Israel’s war on Gaza has proven to be a potent issue in the upcoming by-election, which was triggered following the resignation of Liberal MP and justice minister David Lametti in January.

Last week, CBC News [reported](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-staffers-gaza-montreal-byelection-1.7306984?ref=readthemaple.com)
 that 52 Arab and Muslim staffers in the Liberal government signed a letter saying they would not participate in the by-election campaign due to Justin Trudeau’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

“We can no longer in good conscience campaign for a party that excludes us and our values,” CBC quoted the letter as reading.

The staffers’ demands included “explicitly condemning Israel for its numerous war crimes and for the genocidal rhetoric from members of the Israeli Cabinet,” recognizing the State of Palestine, and revoking all existing permits for arms exports to Israel, including those that are [shipped](https://www.readthemaple.com/u-s-names-quebec-contractor-in-newly-approved-arms-sale-to-israel/)
 via the United States.

### **Repeated Incidents**

The first time the City [removed](https://canadiandimension.com/blog/view/westmount-on-warpath-against-communist-candidates-election-posters?ref=readthemaple.com)
 pro-Palestine election signs was in 2008, when municipal authorities removed signs belonging to the Communist Party of Canada candidate Bill Sloan in the Westmount neighbourhood.

Following that incident, municipal authorities signed an agreement with Elections Canada to not allow such an infringement to occur again, according to Johnson. 

The second incident occurred in 2015, when the Communist Party and a third-party group promoting Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel put up signs denouncing Israel’s human rights violations and occupation of Palestine.

As with the incident in this year’s by-election, in 2015 the City claimed the removals were good faith errors made due to the disturbing imagery on some of the signs, which depicted the body of a Palestinian boy killed by the Israeli military in Gaza.

The two groups took the City to court, which ruled that the City had intentionally violated the fundamental rights of the citizens who displayed the signs, according to Johnson. To his knowledge, none of the coalition’s signs were removed by the City of Montreal.

“Our clients are very justified in having some very serious questions about the motivation of the city in taking down these posters,” said Johnson."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Suburban published an article about Mayor Valérie Plante being served by bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists, which displayed messages such as "Free Palestine. Escalate now" and "Globalize the Intifada." <image:3688> The article mentions that the signs were used to convey anti-Israel messages and call for violence. The CBC News article reports on an anti-NATO protest in Montreal where pro-Palestinian demonstrators were present. <image:1>

The Maple published an article discussing the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election. <image:13> The City of Montreal is facing legal action.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image is of a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine. Escalate now" message. The evidence also indicates that the City of Montreal, and by implication, Mayor Valérie Plante, was involved with the signs. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Mayor Valérie Plante authorized the sign. The evidence does mention that the City of Montreal removed pro-Palestine signs.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the statement about Mayor Valérie Plante's authorization is not directly confirmed by the evidence.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Following a recent boxing match between Jake Paul and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, a widely shared photo surfaced showing Tyson posing with a Palestinian flag before the fight. This image garnered significant attention and commentary on social media. However, Fact Crescendo’s fact-checking team revealed that the photo circulating on Facebook was generated by artificial intelligence.

**Social Media Claim**

An image of American boxing legend Mike Tyson alongside the Palestinian flag has been widely shared on social media recently, suggesting he supports the Palestinian people.

Below is a screenshot of a Facebook post from November 16, 2024, with a caption in Khmer stating, “Mike Tyson poses with the Palestinian flag before a fight.”

 | [Archived Link](https://archive.vn/G2eZh)

The same picture was widely circulated on social media with English captions as well, attracting significant attention and reactions from users.

Similar claims have also been widely shared on other social media platforms, including [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nj.iliass/p/DCZ8h_EN1KC/)
, which is owned by Meta.

A similar photo was also posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW4LHnur7Ao)
 on November 16, showing Mike Tyson holding a Palestinian flag before a fight.

**Fact Check**

Fact Crescendo verified these images using Google Reverse Image Search and AI verification tools. Then, we discovered the following facts.

By running an AI-generated image detector, we discovered that the photo was not authentic. It was created by artificial intelligence (AI) rather than being a real photograph of an actual event.

The findings revealed that the image shown in the photo was entirely generated by AI technology, rather than being captured in reality.

 | [Archived Link](https://archive.vn/6sQc8)

Fact Crescendo also searched Getty Images, a reputable source for authentic photos, and found several images of Mike Tyson before and during the fight. None of these photos showed Tyson holding a Palestinian flag.

This further disproves the claim, as it suggests that no legitimate images from the event feature Tyson with the flag. This reinforces the fact that the original photo shared on social media was not genuine.

The Fact Crescendo team, a group dedicated to verifying and fact-checking claims, also watched the livestream of the highly anticipated fight between Jake Paul, a well-known social media personality turned boxer, and former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. This event, which took place on November 16, was reportedly streamed on Netflix, a popular streaming platform known for airing documentaries and films, though typically not live sports events. 

After carefully reviewing the stream, the team observed no instance where Mike Tyson, the legendary boxer, was seen wearing a Palestine flag, contrary to certain claims that circulated online. The Fact Crescendo team has found no evidence or visual confirmation that Tyson posing that at all.

### Paul–Tyson age difference

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Paul–Tyson age difference")\
\]

Many criticized Paul for fighting Tyson due to the significant age difference. I had to reciprocate."[\[45\]](#cite_note-45)
 In social media posts, some speculated that Tyson's slap was in response to Paul making a racist gesture by climbing on stage and walking up to Tyson on all fours, imitating the [knuckle-walking](/wiki/Knuckle-walking "Knuckle-walking")
 done by [gorillas](/wiki/Gorilla "Gorilla")
 and [chimpanzees](/wiki/Chimpanzee "Chimpanzee")

### Netflix technical issues

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Netflix technical issues")\
\]

Netflix has been criticized for widespread technical difficulties that plagued the event's livestream.[\[28\]](#cite_note-Williams-28)
 Many viewers tuning in were unable to watch the fight due to buffering. Many microphones and earpieces also experienced difficulties, with interviewee [Evander Holyfield](/wiki/Evander_Holyfield "Evander Holyfield")
 struggling to hear the host of the show because of issues with his earpiece.[\[5\]](#cite_note-Bloomberg-5)
 According to [Downdetector](/wiki/Downdetector "Downdetector")
, around 90,000 viewers reported outages in the hour leading up to the fight.[\[3\]](#cite_note-CNN-3)

### Allegations of fixing

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Allegations of fixing")\
\]

Following the fight, a number of outlets expressed concerns that the fight was staged. Just before the fight started, a purported fight script was uploaded online, though the authenticity was doubted.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)
 Due to Paul claiming he "pulled his punches" after the fight,[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 a video from the third round where Paul exposed his chin but Tyson did not hit him despite preparing to punch, claimed it was evidence of the fight being faked.[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 In response, Most Valuable Promotions claimed that it could not have been scripted as that would have been illegal and a violation of the boxing license of both Texas Department of Licensing and Regulating Commission.[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)
 Other media outlets also cited that any pulling of punches would have been done out of respect or sympathy and was not evidence of the fight being scripted.[\[53\]](#cite_note-53)

Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul outboxed the legendary Mike Tyson in front of a record crowd at AT&T Stadium, but the fight was far from exciting.

Instead, the 27-year-old Paul boxed circles around the 58-year-old Tyson and seemed to carry him to the finish line instead of go for the finish.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

French left backs protests after Macron rejects PM choice

! RN leaders Marine le Pen and Jordan Bardella described the NFP as a "danger" for France.

President Macron has sought to form a government made up of "republican forces", which excludes both the far-right National Rally and the radical France Unbowed.

Among other potential candidates named in political circles as France's next prime minister are former Socialist interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve and Xavier Bertrand, who is a regional leader from the centre-right Republicans.

The current caretaker Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Tuesday that, as a as a "great republican", Mr Cazeneuve could well work out as head of a coalition.

Rejecting France Unbowed as dangerous, he told French TV "a New Popular Front government has no chance of surviving in power for more than a day".

Some of France's left-wing leaders have backed protests against President Emmanuel Macron, after he refused to nominate a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front alliance (NFP).

The four-party coalition won the most seats in last month's parliamentary elections and said its candidate, Paris civil servant Lucie Castets, should be named prime minister, even though they fell far short of a majority.

President Macron said France needed institutional stability and the left could not win a confidence vote that would come immediately from its opponents in parliament.

The biggest of the four left-wing parties, France Unbowed, called for a big demonstration on 7 September.

The Communist leader also backed a "big popular mobilisation" in the coming days, although the Socialists indicated that for now there was an urgent need for political discussion.

Mr Macron, whose centrist Ensemble alliance came second in the election, began new consultations with party leaders on Tuesday.

President Macron said France needed institutional stability and the left could not win a confidence vote that would come immediately from its opponents in parliament.

Mr Macron, whose centrist Ensemble alliance came second in the election, began new consultations with party leaders on Tuesday.

He appealed to three of the four left-wing parties - the Socialists, Greens and Communists - to work with "other political forces" to find a way out of the impasse, without mentioning the radical left France Unbowed, which won the most seats of the four.

However, the three parties refused to take up his offer. LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon went further, with a threat to impeach the president.

The party called on youth organisations and other groups to take part in a "big mobilisation" on 7 September, accusing the president of seriously endangering democracy.

Communist leader Fabien Roussel urged the French people to protest wherever they were, "in town centres and in front of prefectures".

Olivier Faure of the Socialists said he too would take part in demonstrations, if they took place. Marine Tondelier of the Greens said her party would not "continue this circus, this sham consultation".

No one group was able to win a majority in the elections, with the NFP gaining more than 190 seats, Mr Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance about 160 and the far-right National Rally (RN) 140.

Mr Macron's term in office continues until 2027, and the French government tends to be formed from the president's party as parliamentary elections usually follow soon after the presidential vote. She is financial director at Paris City Hall and as a senior civil servant she is unelected.

She told French radio on Tuesday that the head of state was telling the people of France they had got the vote wrong: "Democracy means nothing to the president and I find that extremely dangerous."

Both Ensemble and National Rally, whose leaders met the president on Monday, have vowed to vote down candidates from the NFP. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said he would not be an "accomplice in a parody of democracy". But that changed when he called snap parliamentary elections this summer.

A caretaker government has led France since the 7 July vote, including during the Paris Olympics, to the anger of the NFP alliance.

"My responsibility is that the country is not blocked nor weakened," Mr Macron said after a first round of talks on Monday evening.

"The Socialist Party, the Greens and the Communists have not yet proposed ways to co-operate with other political forces. <image:3803>!Reuters Lucie Castets with Communist leader Fabien Roussel <image:3806>Reuters

It was thought unlikely that Mr Macron would pick Ms Castets as PM

France Unbowed (LFI) reacted angrily to the president's words, with national coordinator Manuel Bompard complaining of an "unacceptable anti-democratic coup"."

Content: "Capitol in Washington in 2021.

“They have almost factious attitudes as they call for Matignon \[the French Prime Minister’s residence\] to be taken by force, as far as we understand … it’s their Capitol attack,” Le Pen [told](https://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/cest-leur-assaut-du-capitole-a-eux-marine-le-pen-denonce-les-attitudes-factieuses-du-nfp-qui-veut-prendre-de-force-matignon/)
 reporters on Wednesday as freshly-elected lawmakers from her National Rally party entered the National Assembly.

Le Pen was reacting to comments by Adrien Quatennens, a heavyweight from the far-left France Unbowed movement, the largest group in the left-wing alliance that topped the polls in Sunday’s parliamentary election.

Quatennens isn’t an MP any more but is very close to radical left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon. [Skip to main content](#main)

PARIS — France’s far right leader Marine Le Pen compared the left-wing New Popular Front alliance to rioters who stormed the U.S. Quatennens on Tuesday [called for](https://x.com/AQuatennens/status/1810683316930269296)
 “a people’s march” to the prime minister’s office building in central Paris, arguing that French President Emmanuel “Macron wants to rob us of victory.” He accused the president of “maneuvering to block” the left-wing alliance from implementing its policies, and urged French people “to make him give in.”

Quatennens’ suggestion triggered a backlash from politicians across the spectrum, including key figures on the moderate left. There were no signs of protesters marching on the PM’s official residence on Wednesday.

Quatennens’ call came with Macron under intense pressure from both the left and the right to nominate a new government after his centrists suffered a major electoral defeat last Sunday in the snap election. Leading voices in Macron’s camp and on its right flank [are arguing](https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-france-election-chaos-comeback-new-popular-front/)
 that a coalition gathering the center and MPs from the conservative Les Républicains party would be better placed to form a coalition.

The choice of France’s future prime minister formally belongs to the country’s president, who is not legally bound by the election’s results.

On Wednesday Manuel Bompard, also from the France Unbowed movement, [said](https://x.com/LCI/status/1810929765617901938)
 that Quatennens was not calling for an insurrection.

Le Pen compared the France Unbowed to election-denial rioters who stormed the Capitol building in Washington to protest against the outcome of elections lost by former U.S. The left-wing alliance, who won the most seats in the election but didn’t secure a majority, is claiming the right to pick the next prime minister and form a government.

However, the four parties in the left bloc are not even close to the 289 lawmakers they need for a majority in the National Assembly. Ironically, Le Pen has been a Trump supporter and also [initially questioned](https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20201111-france-s-marine-le-pen-absolutely-does-not-recognise-joe-biden-election-win)

AJC Urges EU Nations to Act on Dismaying New Antisemitism Report
================================================================

    ![A group of extremist Muslims in Europe gathers around a statue with a swastika graffitted on it ](/sites/default/files/styles/banner_wide/public/article-images/2018-12/antisemitism-photo.jpg?h=90718308&itok=6gR5QtvK)

December 10, 2018 — New York

American Jewish Committee (AJC), the global Jewish advocacy organization, is urging concerted initiatives by European governments to confront rising antisemitism, following the release of deeply troubling findings from an EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) survey of Jews across Europe. The survey results were announced today in Brussels by European Union First Vice President Frans Timmermans and Commissioner for Justice Věra Jourová. 

“The FRA conclusion that antisemitism has become ‘normalized’ across the EU is simply unacceptable,” said AJC CEO David Harris, who met with European officials in Brussels ahead of the report’s release, and who began alerting European leaders to the resurgent wave of antisemitism as early as 2001. “Each European country surveyed by the FRA, indeed all EU members states, have a moral responsibility to study the report’s unique, valuable data — and step up efforts to confront the antisemitism cancer that threatens not only Jews, but, no less, the democratic fabric of European societies.”

This is the second EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) survey on discrimination and hate crimes against Jews in the EU. The 2012 FRA survey, the first of its kind, was a wake-up call to the pervasive problem of antisemitism in Europe. 

The 2018 report found that 54 percent of those surveyed positively assess their national governments’ efforts to ensure the security needs of the Jewish community. However, a decisive majority, 70 percent, believe that their governments do not effectively combat antisemitism.

The FRA polled 16,500 Jews in 12 EU member states – Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The 2012 report covered only eight countries.

The 2018 survey paints a distressing picture:

■ 89% say antisemitism has increased in their country over the past five years

■ 85% say antisemitism is a serious problem

■ 89% say antisemitism is “most problematic” on the internet and social media

■ 28% experienced some form of antisemitic harassment in the last year. 

■ 34% avoid visiting Jewish events or sites

■ 38% have considered emigrating because they no longer feel safe as Jews in the country where they live

■ 52% say they do not report antisemitic attacks because, in their view, nothing will change

![Infographic of the stats listed above.](/sites/default/files/inline-images/18Soc_EuropeanJewishOpinionSurvey_white1.png)

Notably, those who say antisemitism is “a very big” or “a fairly big” problem rose significantly in the UK from 48% in 2012 to 75% in 2018, in Germany from 62% to 85%, and in Sweden from 60% to 82%.

French Jews, the largest community in Europe, have the highest level of concern at 95%, followed by Belgian Jews at 86%. Danish Jews ranked 12th among the 12 countries studied in their level of concern. 

In 2015, AJC convened in Brussels “A Defining Moment for Europe,” a strategy conference on combating antisemitism. More than 20 EU countries were represented by diplomats and other officials. The eight-point _[Call to Action](https://www.ajc.org/calltoaction/combatingantisemitism)
_ adopted at the groundbreaking conference was updated in June 2018.

“The FRA reports provide a unique and dismaying perspective,” said Harris. “European leaders, who laudably adopted a declaration in Brussels last week to step-up the fight against antisemitism, must realize that they have not been keeping pace with the growing problem. What’s needed now is enhanced, sustained action on many fronts to ensure that European Jews have a safe and secure future — and that Europe fulfills its noble commitment to the protection of human dignity for all of its citizens.”

‘How can anyone be allowed to paint a swastika on the statue of Marianne, the goddess of French liberty, in the very center of the Place de la République?”

That was what the chairman of one of France’s most celebrated luxury brands was thinking last July, when a tall man in a black shirt and a kaffiyeh leapt to the ledge of Marianne’s pedestal and scrawled a black swastika. All around him, thousands of angry demonstrators were swarming the square with fake rockets, Palestinian and Hamas flags, even the black-and-white banners of ISIS. Here, barely a mile and a half from the Galeries Lafayette, the heart of bourgeois Paris, the chants: “MORT AUX JUIFS! MORT AUX JUIFS!” Death to the Jews. It was Saturday, July 26, 2014, and a pro-Palestinian demonstration turned into a day of terror in one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of the city.

“Do something! Do you see what is happening here?” the chairman said to a line of police officers watching the demonstration build to a frenzy. “What do you expect us to do?” one officer said, then looked away. For years, the chairman, a longtime anti-racism activist, has turned up at rallies like this one to see which politicians and which radical groups were present. (For reasons of personal safety, the chairman asked not to be identified for this story.) France’s endless demonstrations are a mainstay of the republic, a sacred right rooted in the legacy of Voltaire. But hate speech is a criminal offense—people may express their opinions, but not to the extent of insulting others based on their race, religion, or sex. The protest—against Israel’s Gaza policies—had been banned by the government, fearful of violence, following flare-ups in the preceding weeks. But if the police were to move in too quickly, the riots might continue all summer long—suburbs in flames, mobs in central Paris.

Photographs and videos of the swastika and its perpetrator, of protesters chanting “Kill the Jews,” and of the Palestinian, Hamas, and ISIS flags were sent in a rush to various groups in the Jewish community who assess threats. By early afternoon, some of these reached Sammy Ghozlan, a 72-year-old retired police commissioner who has spent his career working the _banlieues,_ the belt of working-class, racially mixed suburbs that surround Paris. Ghozlan is a folk hero of the _banlieues_ and has a nickname that is impossible to forget: _le poulet cacher_—“the kosher chicken.” (_Poulet_ is slang for cop.) For 15 years, he has overseen France’s National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism—known by its French abbreviation, B.N.V.C.A.—a community hotline he founded that is funded by his police pension and whatever small donations he can come by. Its purpose is nothing less than to protect the Jews of France.

This past year, Ghozlan’s frequent bulletins—detailing attacks in parks, schools attacked, synagogues torched, assaults on the Métro—have clogged the in-boxes of reporters at _Le Monde, Le Figaro,_ and _Le Parisien,_ and of thousands of Jews throughout the _banlieues._ Ghozlan’s bulletins sometimes come twice a day, with claims that have also been backed up by hard numbers: according to a watchdog group, the Jewish Community Protection Service, or S.P.C.J., which reports statistics collected by the country’s Interior Ministry, there were 851 recorded anti-Semitic incidents in France in 2014, more than doubling the total from 2013. Ghozlan and his 19 volunteers are on the front lines in the most troubled areas, documenting, trying to confirm, hoping to get a reporter or a police prefect or a court to take action. There has been such an uptick, and such a flurry of alerts from Ghozlan over the past year, that there’s always a risk that his efforts will be shrugged off as yet another nuisance.

Just two weeks before the July 26 riot, Ghozlan’s texts and messages did not stop. It was Bastille Day weekend, and, on Sunday, July 13, he tracked the hundreds of protesters who rushed into the Marais, Paris’s historic Jewish quarter, stopping briefly at an empty synagogue on the Rue des Tournelles, near the Place des Vosges, and then racing, reportedly with iron bars, axes, and flags, toward the Rue de la Roquette, a boutique-and-café-lined street a few blocks from the apartment of Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Their destination was the Don Isaac Abravanel synagogue. Inside, the 200 worshippers—including the chief rabbi of Paris—heard the howls from the crowd, estimated to number about 300: “Hitler was right!” “Jews, get out of France!” Audrey Zenouda, a policewoman who happened to be inside the synagogue, called her father, a retired policeman who works with Ghozlan at the B.N.V.C.A. “Do something. We are terrified here.”

“I knew that if anyone could get the police to take action it would be Sammy and the B.N.V.C.A.,” Zenouda later told me. Only six police officers were assigned to be on demonstration duty that day. “We are waiting for the assault police to arrive,” one told a reporter at the scene. After an hour, a counterterrorism force rescued the chief rabbi, but everyone else was left inside, behind doors barricaded from the inside with chairs and tables. Outside, members of a special security patrol and a dozen members of the self-trained Ligue de Défense Juive began chasing off the demonstrators with chairs and tables from nearby cafés, working with a small unit from the security force. Together, it took them three hours to disperse the crowd and safely evacuate the synagogue.

Almost immediately afterward, the reports of the July 13 demonstration would be challenged and debated. The numbers would be skeptically parsed—were there really so many?—and questions would be asked about actions that might have provoked the violence, as if carrying iron bars and axes around central Paris might be normal. In some circles, there were even accusations that the Jews “brought on the behavior,” as they always do.

In the crowd—and many others that would turn the summer of 2014 into a summer of hate in Paris—were representatives of France’s political parties, both left and right. France’s Muslim population is estimated to be around 5 million, a potential voting bloc in a country of 66 million. (The Jewish population of France is in the neighborhood of 500,000.) Shimon Samuels, the director for international relations at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris—which combats anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and extremism, and, through a foundation, helps to fund Ghozlan’s hotline—witnessed some of the events of July 13. Among those he recognized in the crowd were a local concierge and bank teller, along with members of the current Socialist government.

Monitoring the footage later, Ghozlan was sickened to see the faces of political allies he had worked with for decades, mostly in what is known as Le Neuf Trois (“9–3”), the area of northern Paris suburbs that he once presided over as a commissioner of police. Le Neuf Trois is the rap name for this district, which has the honor of being, by reputation anyway, the most violent in France. (The name derives from the area’s postal codes, which all begin with “93.”) It is also where Ghozlan lived for 30 years in a spacious house surrounded by hedges on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in the relatively calm community of Le Blanc-Mesnil.

For Ghozlan, July 2014 was the tipping point, after years of escalating anti-Semitic violence: “There was no debate in our family. We all knew—it is time to go. Leaving is better than running away,” Ghozlan later told me. He would ultimately come to think of the summer riots as the predictors of the catastrophes that would play out six months later in the terror attacks at the offices of the satirical weekly _Charlie Hebdo,_ three quarters of a mile from the Place de la République, on January 7, 2015, and then, two days later, at Hyper Cacher, a kosher grocery store in the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of eastern Paris.

By then Ghozlan’s classified ad—one nobody who knows him could ever have thought possible—had already been posted: “Renting a house, 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms, a veranda, a garden with 50 m. square.” Two days before the _Charlie Hebdo_ attack, Sammy announced what, to many, including me, was unthinkable: Sammy Ghozlan, proud Frenchman and the dean of Paris’s anti-Semitic crime-fighters, had joined the thousands of French Jews moving to Israel.

**The Sephardic Columbo**
-------------------------

More than a decade ago, I spent weeks with Ghozlan at the height of the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began in September of 2000 and lasted more than four years. Ghozlan had recently started the B.N.V.C.A. hotline and was working from a crammed back room in a synagogue in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais. When I first met him, in the fall of 2002, Ghozlan carried a white plastic binder bulging with one-page reports written up from the calls he’d received from tipsters. All day and all night his phone would ring. It never left his hand. More than 300 reports were in that binder: Molotov cocktails thrown at Jewish schools, students called _sale Juif_ (“dirty Jew”), arsons, desecrations, a Jewish woman beaten in a taxi. The attacks on the Jews of France had yet to catch the attention of the international press, and Ghozlan could get almost no one in Paris to take him seriously.

Now, 12 years later, Ghozlan’s binder is one of 50 that fill the shelves of his office in central Paris. I went to see him again last spring, when he was back in the city, having undergone surgery to repair a tendon in his leg. The B.N.V.C.A. was still operating, with Ghozlan monitoring from Netanya, a seaside town near Tel Aviv, where as many as 2,000 French Jews immigrated to in 2014, and where Ghozlan moved last December, coming back to Paris every six weeks or so.

Ghozlan resembles a beat-up version of Yves Montand, and the decade since we had seen each other only heightened the effect. Otherwise, not much had changed. He still wears the neat blazer and open shirt that suggest his native North Africa. (He was born in Algeria.) And he was still constantly on the phone, issuing directives to investigate allegations of anti-Semitism. He dispatched volunteer lawyers to the courts to try to stop marauding anti-Israel protesters who stripped kosher and Israeli products from supermarket shelves. And he was entrenched in a longtime legal battle against the anti-Semitic, Holocaust-denying comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, who was recently convicted in Paris of condoning terrorism. “This case obsesses me,” Ghozlan told me. “I have been filing against him for 10 years.” On his iPhone, he shows me dozens of pictures of Dieudonné’s fans in front of the Hyper Cacher, after the bloody hostage crisis of January 9, making the sign of the “_quenelle,_” a Nazi-style salute that Dieudonné created and popularized.

It had been two months since that attack, and Ghozlan was fixated on trying to make sense of what had happened inside the Hyper Cacher, where a 32-year-old terrorist named Amedy Coulibaly, who had grown up in a Paris suburb with his Malian parents, massacred four people in a quiet area of bobos and professionals in Porte de Vincennes. He wore a GoPro video camera strapped to his torso to record the slaughter. He reportedly announced to his hostages: “I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State.” By the time the siege was over, four French Jews were dead, including one young man who grabbed a gun that Coulibaly had left on a counter because it had jammed. The day before, Coulibaly had killed a policewoman who was investigating a traffic accident in the suburb of Montrouge.

When news flashed of the Montrouge shooting, Ghozlan was following the situation from Netanya. He had an instinct and contacted a close friend in another Jewish organization who lived nearby. “This morning attack in Montrouge,” he wrote. “Can you check to see if this was near the \[Jewish\] school?” The answer came: “You are right. The school is close. There are rumors, but you are wrong. We are there and the school is not the target.” Later reports indicated that a Jewish school in Montrouge may actually have been Coulibaly’s original target. In Netanya, Ghozlan had yet to unpack his furniture, but he was already making plans to get back to Paris.

Moving back permanently was out of the question, but it hasn’t been easy for Ghozlan to disconnect. “I am deeply French,” he told me. “I did my military service in the air force. I love France’s values, its culture, its history, its cuisine, philosophers, and artists. I never imagined that I would someday leave. I led the fight for 15 years and all our warnings made no difference.” In 2014, about 7,000 Jews left France for Israel, and this year the anticipated exodus is between 10,000 and 15,000. The Jewish Agency for Israel recently reported that, in 2014, 50,000 French Jews made inquiries about moving to Israel, an astonishing number. In many of France’s public lycées, Jewish students are insulted, classrooms are vandalized, books are defaced, and fights break out in the classroom with any attempt to teach the Holocaust. After the _Charlie Hebdo_ and Hyper Cacher attacks, there were reports that classes were disrupted when some Muslim students refused to participate in any memorial for the victims. According to Shimon Samuels, about 40 percent of France’s Jewish students are now in Jewish schools and 35 percent in Catholic schools. “This is an unprecedented situation,” Ghozlan tells me. “We are in new territory here.”

Ghozlan’s phone rings. When he hangs up, he tells me of two unidentified Muslim men who have swept into a Jewish school in Paris’s well-heeled 16th Arrondissement. (Earlier that week, there had been an incident at another Jewish school, in the 11th Arrondissement, an area of professionals, politicians, and writers.) “How did these thugs get into the school?” Ghozlan asks. “They walked around as if they were staking it out.” The school in the 16th was evacuated and the bomb squad deployed. None of this will appear in the press, Ghozlan says. There is a fear in the schools that they will lose more students.

Ghozlan’s voice is the first thing that commands attention—his inflection is almost musical. A part of Ghozlan’s celebrity in the _banlieues_ is his reputation as a former bandleader who played three instruments and oversaw orchestras that worked the Jewish-wedding and Bar Mitzvah circuit in Paris, advertising “Groove, Funck, Hassidiques, Israélien … Oriental.” He learned his limited English by lip-synching to Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive.”

Like 70 percent of France’s Jewish population, Ghozlan is Sephardic, part of the group from North Africa called _pieds-noirs_ (“black feet”). He lived in the Algerian city of Constantine until 1962, when, at age 20, he fled the country with his family in the wake of the Algerian war, taking with him just “a sandwich and a suitcase,” a commonly used _pied-noir_ expression. With his wife, Monique, a petite kindergarten teacher he met when they were both in a Jewish youth group in Algeria, he lived in the house in Le Blanc-Mesnil. There were bedrooms for his three daughters and one son, and his mother, who never missed an episode of _NYPD Blue._ When I first met Ghozlan, he struck me as a Sephardic Columbo. Early in his police career, he managed to negotiate order in a part of the _banlieues_ that was so violent it was nicknamed Chicago. His method was to offer judo classes to the immigrant populations—many of which spoke Arabic, as Ghozlan does. He was assigned to take care of juvenile offenders, who seemed to respond to his direct style and lack of hyperbole, which he had learned, he told me, from his father, a former chief of detectives in Constantine.

Ghozlan made his counterterrorism reputation when the synagogue on the Rue Copernic was bombed in 1980, an attack that killed 4 people and injured more than 40. Ghozlan learned that the perpetrators were Palestinian sympathizers, not the neo-Nazis the police first suspected. He was made special commissioner to investigate the next major anti-Semitic attack, on Chez Jo Goldenberg, a landmark Jewish restaurant in the Marais, where 6 people, including two Americans, were killed, and another 22 wounded, in 1982. Ghozlan’s police career—always running alongside his Bar Mitzvah shows—eventually brought him to head the department in Aulnay-sous-Bois, in Seine-Saint-Denis. He retired in 1998 and in 2000 started the B.N.V.C.A., finding himself almost alone in his fight to protect the Jews of the _banlieues._

Ghozlan has been awarded the Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest tribute. But his urgency has always made him an outlier, an annoyance to the assimilation-conscious, largely secular Jewish establishment concentrated in Paris’s preferred arrondissements, who still view him as a publicity hound from the _banlieues,_ a Jew who does not know when not to react. However noble Ghozlan’s motives, he makes a nuisance of himself with his incessant press releases, I was told a decade ago. That sentiment hasn’t changed in some quarters.

When I originally met Ghozlan, he railed that his jerry-rigged detective agency had to deal with a rigid French justice system. To register a hate crime in France—which comes with a higher level of punishment than an ordinary crime—he would have to appear in front of a magistrate, who was generally loath to call the beating of a rabbi in the Métro an act of anti-Semitism. For them, Ghozlan said, it was a “simple assault,” usually committed by an unemployed French Muslim acting out of frustration. This enraged Ghozlan. “I wanted to start a Jewish defense force,” Ghozlan told me. Judge after judge told him, “There is no anti-Semitism charge applicable unless someone dies.” The party line of the Establishment Jewish organizations in Paris was always “Sammy, stop rocking the boat.” Back then, even David de Rothschild, the banker, told _The\*\*Jerusalem Post_ that the wave of attacks was likely coming from “neo-Nazis, a hostile, aggressive, antisemitic, right-wing population … ” He soon changed his mind.

**Foreigners Again**
--------------------

Twelve years later. It feels like an eye-of-the-storm moment in Paris, as the government of François Hollande tries to restore calm after last summer’s riots and the January terror attacks, amid a faltering economy and plunging euro. When I landed, in March, the rise of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing National Front, was in the headlines, as Paris was still struggling to recover from the terrorist attacks of January. Mounds of flowers and posters could be seen on the streets. There were swirls of tourists at the Louvre, as always, but there were more soldiers with automatic weapons at every Jewish school and institution, even in the dining room of a Rothschild-foundation nursing home. In the lobby of the synagogue on Rue Copernic—the one damaged by the bomb in 1980—schoolchildren walked in proximity to machine guns. The optics were unnerving.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls—taking the risk that he might antagonize his Socialist Party base, which leans pro-Palestinian—was issuing a series of muscular statements seeking to stop the flood of Jews leaving France. Among them: anti-Zionism is “an invitation to anti-Semitism.” An increase in prejudice is “growing in an insufferable manner in our country,” he said, and pledged 100 million euros toward combating “racism and anti-Semitism.” Ten thousand soldiers were deployed throughout the country. Parts of the _banlieues_ have resembled war zones, including, at times, Créteil, east of Paris, where Valls made his pledge. Last December, Créteil endured the brutal case of a 19-year-old woman whose apartment, which she shared with her boyfriend, was broken into. One of her assailants allegedly said, “You must have cash here because you are Jews.” They then gang-raped her. In April, Valls announced that French police had foiled five terrorist attacks in recent months amid stepped-up security. One involved an Algerian who allegedly shot himself by accident and then called an ambulance. “The threat has never been so high,” Valls said. “We have never had to face this kind of terrorism in our history.” (In June, the Anti-Defamation League was preparing to release a survey suggesting that the French population has become increasingly aware of the problem of anti-Semitism.)

More than a million people rally to honor those killed in the _Charlie Hebdo_ and Hyper Cacher terrorist attacks, Place de la République, Paris, January 11, 2015. By Nicolas Gouhier/Abaca Press/SIPA USA.

The former foreign minister, 92-year-old Roland Dumas, once convicted of accepting illegal gifts from a mistress who was a lobbyist for a French oil giant—the conviction was later reversed—criticized Valls, even though they are both in the Socialist Party. “He has personal alliances. That means he has prejudices. Everyone knows he is married to someone … who has influence on him,” Dumas said on a news show. Valls’s wife is the Jewish violinist Anne Gravoin. Immediately, the Wiesenthal center called on President Hollande to strip Dumas of his Légion d’Honneur, as the British designer John Galliano had been when he lashed out against the Jews. Its campaign was unsuccessful.

France has the largest population of Jews in Europe (and the third largest in the world, after Israel and the United States) and has always been seen as the laboratory to understand what is happening on the Continent. But Jews make up less than 1 percent of the French population. Even so, according to the S.P.C.J., they are the target of 51 percent of all racist acts in France. The country has become Israel’s biggest source of immigrants.

There are those who question the dire statistics. “Can you believe that a philanthropist from New York was here last week and told us he had come to offer us humanitarian aid?” said Sacha Reingewirtz, the president of the Union of French Jewish Students, which won a court case against Twitter in 2013, forcing Twitter to identify authors of anti-Semitic tweets in France. Reingewirtz, with degrees from Oxford and the Sorbonne, tries to minimize the fact that swastikas have appeared on university campuses. The Jews of the Paris establishment have long lived a form of double life; religion in France is traditionally a private matter. “There is still a sense of downplay among the upper middle class,” said the author Clémence Boulouque, a former literary critic for _Le Figaro_ who now lives in New York. “There is a sense of pride. There is a reluctance to share our feelings and fears.”

It’s precisely this attitude that Ghozlan has been battling for decades, one that is fiercely resilient given the current mood in Paris. The country’s counterterrorism forces are now desperately trying to cope with what is commonly called the “third wave of anti-Semitism” in modern France. The first wave, coming from the far right, morphed into the neo-Nazi crusades of the 1990s, which targeted not only France’s Jews but also the growing Muslim population isolated in projects on the outskirts of the cities. The second wave came from the far left—rooted in pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel attitudes—and erupted during the first and second intifadas, with flare-ups in the 1990s and early 2000s. The third wave has been propelled by the recent rise of ISIS, has metastasized via thousands of Web sites and social media, and, in France, has become homegrown and home-schooled among a vulnerable population of young Muslims. One Jewish-American expat, living with his young family in a quiet part of Le Neuf Trois, just over the Boulevard Périphérique from Montmartre, told me, “It can feel like there are two choices for a young man in the projects: sell drugs or turn to Islam.”

French Muslims who are as assimilated as French Jews speak privately of suddenly being trapped into the identity of Islam, whether they are religious or not. Sartre once wrote of the Jews, “It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew.” The same can be said about Muslims, as the documentary-film maker and novelist Karim Miské—who was born in Ivory Coast and was not brought up Muslim—wrote in _Le Monde:_ “It is the Islamophobe who makes the Muslim.” Recently, Miské, winner of an English PEN award for his novel _Arab Jazz,_ set in the checkerboard world of the 19th Arrondissement, was in the Marais with his 12-year-old daughter when a well-dressed man looked at him menacingly and said, “Boom.” “The tragedy is that we are now trapped in an identification with religion,” he told me. “Frankly, it is racist.”

I went to visit a Jewish family in the Sixth Arrondissement, where life is as assimilated and as privileged as it gets for Jews in Paris. The 18-year-old daughter, a high-school senior making plans to attend university in England, asked me, “Is it true that if I lived in America I could wear a tiny Star of David necklace or a sweatshirt from Technion university?”

“What would happen if you wore it in this neighborhood?” I asked. “Do you think you would be physically attacked?”

“I would be made to feel _angoisse,_” she said, meaning uncomfortable, filled with anxiety or angst. This teenager was certain there would be looks and harassment, perhaps even a physical altercation. I heard the word _angoisse_ frequently in Paris. However established you have been as a Jew in France, I was told, you no longer have the luxury of feeling invisible. It is as if the Jews of France are being forced yet again into a ghetto of cultural identification. This, despite France’s profound traditions of liberty, equality, and fraternity, not to mention _laïcité_—the stubborn commitment to strict secularism. As a member of an established Jewish family recently told the _Telegraph_ columnist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, “When did we become foreigners again?”

**“No One Else Will Die”**
--------------------------

On the ninth of January, the day of the Hyper Cacher attack in Porte de Vincennes, the sirens of Paris did not stop. Ghozlan’s niece, a lawyer, was on her way to the Hyper Cacher when she ran into a friend just outside the store. It was one P.M. They stopped to talk. Suddenly, a muscular African rushed past her with his knapsack. He knocked her in the shoulder. A few moments later she heard gunshots. She called her uncle immediately. Ghozlan happened to know the store owner. He texted him and started calling everyone he knew in the Paris police.

Only 12 days before, on December 28, Ghozlan had had an ominous feeling and sent out another of his warnings: “The next attack is going to come at an unguarded Jewish business or store. The B.N.V.C.A. demands 24/7 security on Jewish stores.” An associate told him, “You are going too far, Sammy.”

In news reports of the Hyper Cacher attack, one man is called the Unidentified Hostage. I met him in Paris in March, several weeks before French judges placed a gag order on the hostages. His story has never been told publicly. In the five hours that Coulibaly held 19 people hostage, André, as he insists on being called, was the only one alone with the attacker for long stretches of time. When he was finally rescued with the other surviving hostages, he spent hours briefing the counterterrorism squad, was congratulated for his sangfroid, drafted a 10-page statement, and met Prime Minister Valls at a reception. Soon after, André took leave from work, afraid for his life.

André is 43, a computer tech with clients that include law firms and banks. He is Jewish, but non-observant, and does not keep kosher. He had heard of Sammy Ghozlan but never paid particular attention to the B.N.V.C.A. Like everyone in Paris, he was badly shaken by the terrorist attack at the offices of _Charlie Hebdo,_ and on Friday, January 9, he and his girlfriend made the decision to stay in for the weekend. The Hyper Cacher is known for its appetizers—tabbouleh, hummus, freshly prepared every day. Moments after they entered the shop to buy some snacks for the weekend, they heard gunshots and raced downstairs to the basement with others to hide. A few minutes later, a fellow customer rushed down and told them, “He will kill us all if you do not come up.” André and his girlfriend followed a group upstairs to a scene of bodies, blood pooling on the floor, and an angry Coulibaly: “Does anyone here know anything about computers?”

For André, the smooth-faced African was obviously “a boy of the _banlieues._” He was struck by what seemed to be a split in Coulibaly’s personality. He seemed equal parts insecure student and newly trained terrorist, as if he were taking cues from the ISIS playbook, which inspires working-class would-be jihadists to morph into monsters capable of beheading. “It is a form of empowerment,” André said. It became clear to André that, for all his training, Coulibaly did not possess the tech skills needed to perform what was evidently an essential task: the uploading of his GoPro footage of the carnage, in which four people were slaughtered in the first moments of the attack. “He needed it for instant replay on jihadi sites,” André said. Just as urgently, Coulibaly wanted to get online to monitor the news. “What was urgent is that his footage was expected to be uploaded while he was in the store to incite other attacks in Paris.”

Coulibaly had raced into the store with at least one Kalashnikov rifle, a Scorpion submachine gun, two Tokarev pistols, knives, ammunition, and a silver laptop, with instructions on how to upload his footage and what to say to the news media. What he did not bring, however, was any equipment to make it work without Wi-Fi. The Hyper Cacher had no Wi-Fi. In addition, Coulibaly forgot to bring his charger cord, and his laptop was running out of power. In the office of the small store, his frustration was mounting. “He was desperate to get online,” André said. André volunteered to help. For the next five hours, he was in and out of the office of the Hyper Cacher as Coulibaly ricocheted between rage and calm. At one point, Coulibaly questioned the hostages and learned that André had never been inside the Hyper Cacher before. “Wow, that is bad luck,” Coulibaly said.

André is a slight man, with delicate hands and large expressive eyes. It was easy to understand how Coulibaly would not have found him threatening. His size, however, masked his physical strength and discipline. On the day we met, he wore purple suede running shoes and a gray silk scarf knotted around his neck. His first task was to get Coulibaly online. “Are you sure you know what you are doing?” Coulibaly said, and hovered over him with the guns. “I just focused,” André said. “I told him what I was doing as I was doing it. And at all times I called him ‘mister,’ and I used the formal _vous,_ as a way of showing my respect. I wanted to keep him calm. I knew that already he had killed four people, and I made it my mission: No one else will die. ‘We don’t need Wi-Fi,’ I told him. ‘I can get you online.’ ” André grabbed a cable from the Hyper Cacher’s printer, used it to connect Coulibaly’s laptop to the store’s Internet hookup, and opened a Web browser on Coulibaly’s desktop. He could have used an application that would have left no footprint—like Tails, the choice of Edward Snowden—but a browser, André knew, is easily trackable.

Soon, the news was up on the three channels Coulibaly had requested, France 24, Canal+, and BFMTV, the country’s leading news network, which Coulibaly was determined to contact. André remained near him. “Connect me to the newsdesk,” Coulibaly snapped, but he kept his laptop angled so André could not see directly onto the screen. What he did manage to see was a complex set of instructions that Coulibaly had downloaded and was trying to follow. On the telephone finally with BFMTV, Coulibaly began to free-associate a rambling statement about his mission to avenge the Prophet and kill the Jews. When he hung up, he continued to speak to André, and, from time to time, others in the store. He allowed the hostages to have lunch. “I will serve you,” André said, which angered Coulibaly. “I have not given you that order,” Coulibaly said.

Some of what Coulibaly talked about that day was tracked by authorities when they were able to monitor a Samsung Galaxy phone Coulibaly had borrowed from one customer, but much was not. To André, he admitted that he had killed the policewoman in Montrouge and that he was working with Cherif and Said Kouachi, the brothers responsible for the _Charlie Hebdo_ massacre. “He said, ‘There are many people like me who are now preparing in Arab countries.’ He told me, and others too, ‘I am not crazy. We understand the Koran. We understand the good and the right way.’ ” Coulibaly’s French sounded unsophisticated to André, without subjunctives. On the telephone, however, with French media, he spoke a more academic French, as if he had been tutored with a formal script.

What André never revealed to Coulibaly was that, in his early career, he had, in fact, been a teacher in a very tough suburb. “It was a different France then,” he told me. “In the 1990s we had no problems. I had students that reminded me of Coulibaly. They were operating out of the system. We were trained in how to work with them.” The first step, he said, was to always show them respect. “I knew to listen and not to argue. I knew, ‘Do not use the familiar _tu_—that only came at the end.’ I used the word _vous_ until he began saying ‘_tu_’ to me.”

André did not tell Coulibaly another essential fact of his life. On the roster of his tech clients were some with high security clearances at foreign embassies. From a cold-storage room in the basement of the Hyper Cacher, he had texted his contacts. The French counterterrorism squad still has his phone, he said, but André re-created a version of what he sent: “It is very urgent. There is a terrorist attack at Hyper Cacher. He has already killed.” He noticed that he had only two bars on his own Samsung Galaxy and worried that it would not go through. He quickly sent another: “I am downstairs in the refrigerator room.” And one more: “I am in the Hyper Cacher of Porte de Vincennes. There is someone with a weapon and he has already killed.”

Several times that afternoon, Coulibaly, finally calm, asked André, “Do you understand why I am doing what I am doing? Do you understand what I am doing here? I am here because the Prophet has given me an order. I am here to stop the war in the Arab countries.”

“I said, ‘I can understand what you are saying.’ I went into a neutral state, like a teacher. I wanted him to see into my eyes and know that I was not angry. I said, ‘I am here and I will try to help you.’ ” He was, André believed, hoping for a glimmer of mutually understood truth or to hear perhaps the ultimate French compliment of agreement: _exactement!_

Reliving it, André starts to tremble slightly. He has been in therapy since January, as has his girlfriend, who still cannot get on the Métro. His fear is that he will be identified, and his life will be threatened. “Again and again he said, ‘This is not my fault. I have to do this. It is not against you personally.’ He wanted me to acknowledge in some way his point of view. And what had brought him to what he had to do. He needed to be understood.”

The most troubling question in the French Jewish community is also the most obvious one: “Is it time to leave?”

I asked Roger Cukierman, the head of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France, or CRIF, the umbrella group for secular Jewish organizations in France. I expected him to equivocate, but, by way of an answer, he quickly reeled off some of the horrors that have plagued the Jews of Europe during the last decade: the case of Ilan Halimi, a cell-phone salesman kidnapped, brutally tortured, and killed in the Paris suburbs by a gang in 2006 for being Jewish; the 2012 murders of three small children and one adult at point-blank range at the Ozar Hatorah school, in Toulouse, by Mohamed Merah; the 2014 slaughter at the Brussels Jewish Museum; the deadly attack at the synagogue in Copenhagen in February of this year. This March, Merah’s stepbrother was pictured in the _New York Post_ in his camouflage ISIS togs pronouncing a death sentence, as a pre-pubescent boy beside him pulled the trigger in the videotaped execution of the 19-year-old Israeli Arab Muhamed Musalam. Then there are the riots. As Cukierman told _The Telegraph_ last summer, “They are not screaming ‘Death to the Israelis’ on the streets of Paris. They are screaming ‘Death to the Jews.’ ”

To get a better idea of why Ghozlan decided to leave, I went to visit his friend and colleague Yossi Malka, a retired businessman who works for the B.N.V.C.A. Malka met me at the commuter rail station at Stains, a suburb in Le Neuf Trois. If you didn’t know better, you could be in parts of Queens or the Bronx. Here are the same gray projects, laundry flung over the balconies.

Malka wore a worn brown leather jacket, a natty tie, and a fedora—what I think of as the uniform of the _banlieues_—and drove me to Sarcelles, 20 minutes away and part of what is called the Red Belt, a string of suburban towns, many with Communist or Socialist mayors historically but, now, an expanding National Front. “This is not the Paris of Woody Allen,” Malka told me as we approached a small synagogue ringed by low apartment buildings topped with satellite dishes. “That Paris no longer exists.”

Sarcelles, which borders Le Neuf Trois, is an extended area of small apartment houses, shopping centers, projects, and markets, the first stop for middle-class Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians, who, like Ghozlan’s family, immigrated to France in the 1960s. For decades these neighborhoods were peaceful, a vibrant mix of French citizens and immigrants, all trying to make their way in a country with little regard for their special identities.

“Welcome to the most endangered synagogue in France,” Malka said as we entered a small driveway in Garges-lès-Gonesse, a suburb next to Sarcelles. “Look at that,” he said, pointing out through the windshield. “All day, they throw things—melons, garbage, rocks, and bottles.” Parked in front was a large silver van from France’s counterterrorism force, Vigipirate.

In Garges last July, a week after the violence on the Rue de la Roquette, a highly visible billboard advertising lollipops was modified with a large scrawl: PALESTINE WILL LIVE, PALESTINE WILL OVERCOME. COME WITH: MORTAR, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, BATON. DEMONSTRATION AT THE GARGES-SARCELLES TRAIN STATION. COME OUT IN NUMBERS! FOLLOW TO THE JEWISH QUARTER.

French authorities took action, and the pro-Palestinian demonstrations planned for the weekend, which clearly promised another wave of anti-Semitic violence, were forbidden. Yet nothing was done to stop them. On Saturday, July 19, thousands appeared in and around Paris, burning cars, attacking buses. By two P.M. the next day, a mob of hundreds crowded the narrow street by the Garges synagogue, and the first rocks had shattered the Star of David window. Hammers were taken to the lock at the gate; the marks were still visible when I visited in March. The police refused to move in. Ghozlan was alerted immediately but could hardly hear over what had become the standard rallying cry: “MORT AUX JUIFS!” Their next destination: the shopping center in Sarcelles and its large synagogue, two blocks away, another stop on Malka’s grim tour.

Ghozlan sent out a blast via text message: “Big emergency in Sarcelles. Stores are being attacked. Synagogue is being held by demonstrators. Police are not going in Sarcelles.” Within the hour, a pharmacy was in flames. Then hundreds raced through the central plaza toward a Jewish market and that too went up in flames. Then on to the synagogue. Ghozlan was furiously texting for every member of the Ligue de Défense Juive in the area to get to the synagogue and protect it, while advising the general public to “stay out of Sarcelles.”

News footage showed French police standing inert for almost two hours until reinforcements arrived with tear gas. (The previous day, the police had used tear gas and made 38 arrests.) With the help of the Ligue, they were able to push back the mob. Later, they would say they were waiting for authorization: France’s police are under strict instructions not to intervene without actual threats of violence. When the young people of the synagogue came outside, they began to sing “La Marseillaise” to thank the police for their rescue. Standing in the crowd, Malka saw several French police officers crying. “This should not be happening ever again in France,” one of them told Malka. Earlier that afternoon, Prime Minister Valls had laid a wreath during a commemoration of the 72nd anniversary of the roundup that sent more than 13,000 Jews from Paris to the Nazi death camps.

When I asked Ghozlan about this day, his eyes moistened. “I relived my childhood. In Algeria, the French said they would protect us. Then the mobs came and torched Jewish businesses and we had to flee.”

The first things Ghozlan packed last November were his musical instruments, two violins and a piano. Then he sorted through hundreds of family photographs and letters. He shipped a Louis XVI commode and a writing desk but left most of the furniture for the tenants, an immigrant family who were the first to answer the ad for the house on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil that Ghozlan had built in the 1970s. Today, few of the Ghozlans’ Jewish neighbors remain; two-thirds of the members of his synagogue down the street have departed. His three daughters have already moved to Israel.

Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, in a still from a video he recorded before the Hyper Cacher attack. From Polaris.

What surprised many was Ghozlan’s determination to leave. He resisted encouragement from a friend and neighbor, Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam of Drancy, who moved to that suburban town, the next one over from Le Blanc-Mesnil, from Tunisia in 1996. He has been an ally of Ghozlan’s for most of the past decade, attending his rollicking Shabbat dinners and hosting Ghozlan for lunches at his mosque. “I told him again and again, ‘You cannot leave,’ ” Chalghoumi told me. “Sammy would not engage in the conversation.”

Chalghoumi is tall and commanding, with an exuberant personality. “The world changed on 9/11,” he said. “At the airport I am often pulled out of the lines.” But the imam reacted strongly when I referred to “Islamophobia.” “I will not use that word,” he said. “That plays into a sense of victimization.”

Chalghoumi gave a speech at the Shoah Memorial in Drancy in 2006. Not long after, his house was vandalized, the contents damaged or destroyed. At a prayer service in 2009, Chalghoumi talked about the need to respect the Jews and their centuries of culture. The next day, around 200 protesters collected outside his mosque, confronting anyone who tried to enter. Many of the protesters waved signs: PUPPET OF THE JEWS. With members of a Jewish organization, he toured Israel with 20 imams in 2012. When he returned, there was a mass of demonstrators at the airport. In 2013, he was in Tunisia with his family when he was assaulted near a mosque. His daughters were with him and have yet to get over it. He spent days in the hospital.

I met Chalghoumi in a private room at a Hilton, given to him, he said, by “Jewish friends”—the hotel owners. With him were three bodyguards. His next appointment was with the grand rabbi of Brussels, and soon, Chalghoumi said, he would be on his way back to Israel. His phone rings as frequently as Ghozlan’s. One of the calls that day was from someone informing the imam that the French government would start shutting down a few Islamist Web sites that were advocating terrorism. “Bravo,” he said. “It’s a start.”

He pulled out his iPhone and showed me dozens of racist sites, many naming him as a target. Suddenly, I heard shouts from the speaker. The images on the screen were of demonstrators massed against him in Drancy. The problem in France, Chalghoumi believes, “is the foreign funding of mosques where imams are often imported from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Why won’t the government put a stop to it? No one is monitoring what is going on. All of the imams here should be trained in France.”

When Ghozlan was in the hospital, Chalghoumi made sure to visit—the only one of his friends, Ghozlan later told me, who made the effort. The imam thinks he might still have a shot at getting his friend to move back to Paris. “I am not giving up,” he told me. “I am going to make him change his mind.”

Throughout the second half of 2014, Ghozlan and the B.N.V.C.A. were in overdrive amid a flurry of new reports: signs in Le Neuf Trois that said, HITLER WAS RIGHT; a 16-year-old Jewish student hospitalized when four Africans jumped him; groups making Nazi salutes at the Shoah Memorial; the robbery and rape in Créteil. A new white plastic binder had to be started.

On Christmas Day, Ghozlan received word that an air rifle had been fired at a kosher fast-food restaurant in the 19th Arrondissement, just a few days after a synagogue had been similarly attacked. Then, the following day, a nearby synagogue and a printer’s shop. Ghozlan insisted on cranking out a press release. Then he sent out the alert predicting further attacks on Jewish stores, 12 days before Coulibaly entered the Hyper Cacher.

On that January day, the chairman of the luxury-goods company who witnessed the defacing of Marianne with a swastika last July got a hysterical phone call from his daughter. She had learned on Facebook that one of her father’s cousins was trapped inside the store. Her father was already in a garage off the Champs-Élysées, getting on his motorcycle to try to get through the police lines in Porte de Vincennes.

Inside the office of the Hyper Cacher, Coulibaly was desperate to connect to the police. He demanded that André dial the number. Coulibaly heard the recording: “ ‘If you need this office, press 1. If you need that office, press 2,’ ” André told me. “Coulibaly said, ‘What bullshit. Nothing in this country works.’ ” He had managed to get through to French TV but was still having other problems. He needed to upload his GoPro footage, but, André said, “his program was a very old Adobe Flash Player. Maybe if the Flash Player would have been working, I would never have been in that office all that time. At one point, he asked all of us our names and religion. And what we did for a living. I said, ‘I am a handyman. That is how I know computers.’ At that moment, he took his weapon and started to load it. I thought, This is the end.”

In the Hyper Cacher office later that afternoon, André saw that Coulibaly’s upload of his seven minutes of carnage had stalled at 87 percent. Then he heard noises coming from outside. He and his girlfriend hid under the checkout counter. Coulibaly had gone to a corner of the store to pray. When the counterterrorism squad sprayed bullets into the store, Coulibaly was killed instantly. As André and the other hostages, including the luxury-company chairman’s cousin, rushed out, they were told, “Do not look to your side.” In the pandemonium, André did not notice Coulibaly’s dead body next to the checkout counter.

Nicolas Comte, the head of the Unité SGP police union, had been among the crowd earlier in the day outside the Hyper Cacher. Tall and broadly built, he resembles a TV anchor and is the face of the French police. When we spoke, he mentioned that the concerns of the Jewish community were crucial to him. “Why?” I asked. He hesitated. “I don’t tell many people, but my wife is Jewish and so are my children.” Comte is Catholic. The one time he had met Sammy Ghozlan was when Comte went to his in-laws’ synagogue in Le Blanc-Mesnil. “I knew him only from his reputation. He’s a hero of mine,” Comte said.

Like many in his situation, Comte now lives “a bit of a double life,” he said, in France. “I have told all my children, ‘Do not let anyone know you are Jewish. It is a private affair.’ But my youngest son, recently a Bar Mitzvah, insists on wearing a small Star of David. I let him know my concern. I said, ‘You must be careful.’ Now, when I go to synagogue, I have a gun that I carry in my coat pocket so no one can see it. It has come to that.”

Not long after the attack on the Hyper Cacher, representatives of the Ministry of the Interior appeared on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil. They had come to alert Ghozlan that he would now have a security detail posted at his house at all times. Ghozlan’s tenants informed them, “Mr. Ghozlan has moved from France,” and gave them his new address in Israel.

BERLIN — Across Europe, the conflict in Gaza is generating a broader backlash against Jews, as threats, hate speech and even violent attacks proliferate in several countries.

Most surprising perhaps, a wave of incidents has washed over Germany, where atonement for the Holocaust and other Nazi crimes is a bedrock of the modern society. A commitment to the right of Israel to exist is ironclad. Plaques and memorials across the country exhort, “Never Again.” Children are taught starting in elementary school that their country’s Nazi history must never be repeated. Even so, academics say the recent episodes may reflect a rising climate of anti-Semitism that they had observed before the strife over Gaza.

This week, the police in the western city of Wuppertal detained two young men on suspicion of throwing firebombs at the city’s new synagogue; the attack early Tuesday caused no injuries. In Frankfurt on Thursday, the police said, a beer bottle was thrown through a window at the home of a prominent critic of anti-Semitism. She heard an anti-Jewish slur after going to the balcony to confront her assailant, The Frankfurter Rundschau reported. An anonymous caller to a rabbi threatened last week to kill 30 Frankfurt Jews if the caller’s family in Gaza was harmed, the police said.

The string of incidents comes after Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned anti-Semitic chants from pro-Palestinian demonstrators and President Joachim Gauck called on Germans to “raise their voices if there is a new anti-Semitism being strutted on the street.”

But even as the police have clamped down on demonstrators, banning slogans that target Jews instead of Israeli policies, a spike in violence has spread fear among Jews, not only in Germany but also in other European countries.

More Jews have begun leaving France in recent months, following anti-Semitism that has spilled onto the streets since the start of the Gaza conflict almost a month ago. While most of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been peaceful, a small number of violent protesters, many of them young Arab men, has targeted Jewish businesses and synagogues.

The search results discuss the 2024 French protests against the National Rally, which began on June 9, 2024, after the National Rally party's victory in the 2024 European Parliament election and the subsequent snap legislative elections. The protests were organized by left-wing political parties, unions, and human rights groups and took place in multiple cities across France. Some protesters carried pro-Palestinian messages <image:i>. The BBC News article discusses protests in France after President Macron refused to nominate a government led by the left-wing New Popular Front alliance (NFP) following the parliamentary elections. The NFP wanted Lucie Castets as prime minister, but Macron sought to form a government excluding both the far-right National Rally and the radical France Unbowed. The article also mentions a planned demonstration on September 7. <image:3803>, <image:3804>, <image:3806>

Politico reports that Marine Le Pen compared the left-wing New Popular Front alliance to rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol building. Adrien Quatennens called for a "people's march" to the prime minister's office building.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that protests occurred in France in 2024, organized by left-wing groups, following the European Parliament election and subsequent snap legislative elections. The protests were against the National Rally party. The image search results show that swastikas have been displayed at pro-Palestinian protests. The image in the claim shows a swastika and pro-Palestinian messages.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely accurate. The image appears to depict a protest in France, potentially related to the 2024 elections, given the presence of pro-Palestinian messages and a swastika.

The image <image:20>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that protests occurred in France in 2024, organized by left-wing groups, following the European Parliament election and subsequent snap legislative elections. The protests were against the National Rally party. The image search results show that swastikas have been displayed at pro-Palestinian protests. The image in the claim shows a swastika and pro-Palestinian messages.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely accurate. The image appears to depict a protest in France, potentially related to the 2024 elections, given the presence of pro-Palestinian messages and a swastika.


## Final Judgement
The claim is likely accurate. The evidence confirms protests in France in 2024 against the National Rally, and the image shows a swastika and pro-Palestinian messages, which aligns with the context of the protests. `true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image likely depicts a protest in France related to the 2024 elections, as confirmed by the web search results, which show protests against the National Rally party. The presence of pro-Palestinian messages and a swastika in the image, as revealed by the image search, further supports this context.

The photojournalist [Evan Vucci](/wiki/Evan_Vucci "Evan Vucci")

 Journalists compared this image to other iconic photographs capturing singular events in American history and remarked on the improbability of capturing a bullet speeding past the subject of an attempted assassination.

Trump assassination attempt suspect can represent himself at trial, judge rules

Routh has said he and his attorneys "a million miles apart"

A man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year will be allowed to represent himself at trial, a court has ruled.

Ryan Routh, 59, is charged with trying to assassinate then-candidate Trump by aiming a rifle through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.

US District Judge Aileen Cannon approved his request to represent himself at trial, but ordered court-appointed attorneys to remain on standby. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm charges.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.

Routh has been held in a Florida jail since last September, when he was arrested on a main highway after fleeing Trump's golf course. He had been spotted with his rifle barrel poking through a fence at the oceanfront golf course before a Secret Service agent saw him and fired in his direction.

Police say Routh hid for nearly 12 hours in the bushes waiting for Trump, who was playing golf.

Court records suggest Routh had been plotting his attack on the then-presidential candidate for months.

He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result.

Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life as he ran for office."

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect.

Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots.

Shakeri told the FBI that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to set aside other work he was doing and assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.

The official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that “We have already spent a lot of money" and that “money’s not an issue.” Shakeri told investigators the official told him that if he could not put together a plan within the seven-day timeframe, then the plot would be paused until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him then, the complaint said.

Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge.

Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said the president-elect was aware of the assassination plot and nothing will deter him “from returning to the White House and restoring peace around the world.”

According to the complaint, though officials determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements regarding a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were determined to be accurate.

The plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. <image:3920>](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-25020/trump-campaign-hack-iran-election)

Iranian operatives also conducted a hack-and-leak operation of emails belonging to Trump campaign associates in what officials have assessed was an effort to interfere in the presidential election and harm Trump's campaign.

Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Two other men were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill prominent Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement.

“I’m very shocked,” said Alinejad, speaking by telephone to The Associated Press from Berlin, where she was about to attend a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the tearing down of the wall. as a child but was later deported after spending 14 years in prison for robbery, also told investigators that he was tasked by his Revolutionary Guard contact with plotting the killings of two Jewish-Americans living in New York and Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka."

Iran launched a barrage of missiles against Israel overnight and into Sunday, with Israeli authorities reporting that more than 80 people were wounded, the vast majority of them lightly.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the time for diplomacy had passed and his country had the right to defend itself.

Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who had threatened to resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joined Israel’s military campaign, called on other Muslim nations to form “one front against the Zionist-American arrogance.”

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The United States inserted itself into Israel’s war against Iran, bombing three of the Islamic Republic’s key nuclear sites overnight in an attack it dubbed “Operation Midnight Hammer.” U.S. The war so far has killed hundreds of people and wounded more than 1,000 in Iran and killed two dozen and wounded hundreds in Israel.

Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued it could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon, making it an imminent threat.

The region has been on edge for the past two years as Israel seeks to annihilate the Hamas militant group, an Iranian ally, in the Gaza Strip, where war still rages after Hamas’ Oct. on Wednesday that strikes against Iran would “result in irreparable damage for them.”

The Israeli military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. President Trump meets Israeli PM Netanyahu in Washington <image:3921>

Content: "However, US intelligence sources told CNN the strikes may only have set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back by a matter of months, according to preliminary assessments.

President Trump announced a ceasefire after Iran launched an attack at a US base in Qatar Monday, which it sent warning of in advance.

Israel and Iran traded missile strikes Tuesday, accusing one another of breaking the ceasefire, before each side recommitted to it.

Marc Volovici, a 42-year-old historian, told Reuters in Haifa that the US involvement in the conflict underscored Israel’s dependence on its key ally.

“It’s just a demonstration that Israel, even though it claims to be in charge of its own fate and future, is still dependent on American support completely in terms of both political and financial backing and, of course, ammunition.”

The UN ambassador also hinted that Israel was open to new relationships with Arab nations.

Now is the “time to build bridges and partnerships in the region,” he said, without pointing to any particular country but citing Israel’s normalization of relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco through the Abraham Accords.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked US President Donald Trump for the United States’ involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.

In an address to the nation Tuesday night, the prime minister expressed gratitude to Trump for “his coordination and joining the campaign, not just on the defensive, but also offensively,” calling it a “historic event.”

“We have never had a greater friend in the White House,” he said of Trump.

Netanyahu said that just hours before the ceasefire, Israel carried out the most “devastating” strike Tehran has seen in 50 years.

“We eliminated hundreds of regime operatives and members of the Revolutionary Guard,” he said.

Israel “destroyed” Iran’s nuclear program, Netanyahu said, warning if anyone in Iran tries to restore the program, Israel will “act with the same determination and the same force to foil such an attempt.”

**Remember:** Trump flashed intense anger this morning, criticizing both sides, but reserving his [harshest condemnation for Israel,](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcaf5mst00003b6prm250209)
 who he said “unloaded” on Iran “as soon as we made the deal.” While Netanyahu thanked Trump, the president’s decision to launch airstrikes against Iran is broadly unpopular with Americans, [according to a new CNN poll](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/trump-iran-strikes-poll-cnn-ssrs)

'They don't know what the f\*\*k they're doing': Trump lashes out at Israel and Iran

02:25

**• Early intel assessment:** The US military’s strikes on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend did not destroy the core components of its nuclear program and likely [only set it back by months](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites)
, according to an early US intelligence assessment that was described by sources briefed on it. The White House acknowledged the existence of the assessment but said it disagreed with it.

**• Trump’s rebuke:** US President Donald Trump [flashed intense anger this morning](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcaf5mst00003b6prm250209)
 as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. Before heading to the [NATO summit](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/nato-summit-trump-solitary-approach)
 in the Netherlands, Trump conveyed he was particularly unhappy with Israel.

**• Ceasefire appears to hold:** Both Israel and Iran said they will not break the ceasefire unless the other does so first, after the two countries earlier traded accusations of truce violations. Trump also said he [does not seek regime change in Iran](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcakn6wq00003b6rnk2xjmfm)
 because he doesn’t want to see “chaos.”

Israelis on the streets of Haifa Tuesday afternoon welcomed a tentative end to their country’s 12-day conflict with Iran and expressed some gratitude to US President Donald Trump for his role in the currently holding ceasefire.

Interviews conducted in the northern city by the Reuters news agency came just hours after Trump used a profanity to lash out at Israel, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, and Iran, of breaching the ceasefire he had announced.

“Yes, that’s typical Trump,” a 70-year-old Haifa resident, who gave her name as Esther, told Reuters.

Haifa has been the target of Iranian missiles since Israel’s initial strikes on June 13, including an attack that injured dozens on Saturday.

Daniel Kopylkov, a 27-year-old cook, told Reuters: “Honestly, I don’t care that much about what Trump said about Israel.

The US struck three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, in attacks the White House said “obliterated” Tehran’s nuclear program. local time, before deleting and reposting after correcting a spelling error in the original post, slamming CNN and The New York Times, for what he called “AN ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN” the strikes.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against CNN’s reporting earlier Tuesday as well, acknowledging its existence but calling it “flat-out wrong.”

Iran’s United Nations envoy Amir-Saeid Iravani thanked Qatar for its role in the Iran-Israel ceasefire at a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday.

“I wish to sincerely thank our brotherly and friendly nation the state of Qatar for its sincere and diplomatic efforts to help end Israeli aggression, establish a ceasefire and prevent a further escalation of regional tensions that threaten peace and stability in the region,” the Iranian diplomat told the council.

Iravani’s expression of gratitude to Qatar comes a day after Iran launched an attack on a US airbase in the Gulf country.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there was an assassination plot against Donald Trump, but it was orchestrated by Iran, not Jewish Americans. The evidence also shows that the U.S. was involved in the Iran-Israel war, including military intervention and Trump's involvement in brokering a ceasefire.

The claim that Israel wants American money and servicemen is not directly supported by the evidence, although the U.S. did provide military support.

The claim is partially supported, but with inaccuracies. The assassination plot was not orchestrated by Jewish Americans, but by Iran. The evidence does support the U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel war.

Harris, Trump condemn pro-Hamas protest near US Capitol

Print

The two leading U.S. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024.

In her statement, Harris concluded, "I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation."

In the first days of her presidential campaign against Republican Trump, Harris held a campaign rally with a teachers' union in the southwestern state of Texas on Thursday before flying to Washington to meet with Netanyahu at the White House. You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president."

After Wednesday's protests, Trump called for Israel to quickly end the war and said the country was "not good" at promoting its cause in world affairs.

"You got to get it done quickly," Trump told Fox News.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on Thursday condemned the most visible of the pro-Hamas protests against Israel that erupted the day before near the U.S. flag.

The protests came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was defiantly defending his country's war against the Hamas militants in an address to Congress.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, said in a statement, "We saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric" at Union Station, Washington's train depot not far from the Capitol.

In the plaza in front of the rail station, demonstrators replaced American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of a fountain and used red spray paint to write "Hamas is comin'" in big letters. officials, condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.

But as the months of fighting have raged on, and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza targeting Hamas fighters killed more Palestinian civilians, especially thousands of women and children, Harris became more outspoken, initially blunter than Biden, about the need to end the conflict.

In March, she called for an "immediate" pause in fighting, contending that Israel had not done enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" among Palestinians in Gaza.

"People in Gaza are starving," she said. That's who Kamala Harris is."

Trump, after remaining mostly silent about the Israel-Hamas war, in March told Israel it has "to finish the problem."

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

Content: "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in a social media post on Thursday, called for the annihilation of Iran if they ever assassinate him, following reports of such plots by Tehran.

[**His statement was made**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112848319395019188)
 alongside a video clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday, where Netanyahu emphasized Iran's threats.

On Truth Social, Trump wrote, “If they do ‘assassinate President Trump,’ which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth — If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered ‘gutless’ cowards!”

[**US authorities were reportedly**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407175455)
 aware of an alleged Iranian plan to assassinate Trump before an attempt on his life occurred at a rally. [**Despite Iran's denials**](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2024/07/17/3123348/iran-refutes-allegation-of-involvement-in-trump-assassination-bid)
, the security concerns for those involved in the decision to kill Soleimani remain significant, necessitating ongoing protection measures.

Trump's post echoes his controversial rhetoric from 2019, when he threatened the "obliteration" of Iran if they attacked "anything American."

    Negar Mojtahedi On July 13, twenty-year-old Thomas Michael Crooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing a former volunteer fire chief and injuring two others. Trump was slightly injured in his ear.

However, no direct link has been found between the reported Iranian plot and the attempted assassination.

[**In a recent interview**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407182631)
 with Iran International, Trump's former national security aide John Bolton said that naturally Trump would take the Iranian threat personally.

Trump withdrew from the Obama-era JCPAO nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and imposed heavy sanctions, that have crippled Iran's weak economy.

Relations between the US and Iran became more strained since the 2020 US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, and Iran's top military intelligence operative in the Middle East.

Iranian officials, both political and military, have persistently issued threats against Trump and former members of his administration to avenge Soleimani's death, who orchestrated Iran's proxy operations throughout the region. For instance, in February 2023, Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, explicitly declared that the Islamic Republic intends to kill Trump.

In January 2022, Iran's [**former President Ebrahim Raisi**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202201033940)
 vowed retaliation for Soleimani's killing unless former US President Donald Trump was brought to trial.

"If Trump and (former Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo are not tried in a fair court for the criminal act of assassinating General Soleimani, Muslims will take our martyr's revenge," Raisi said in a televised speech.

In 2022, the US Justice Department brought charges against a member of the IRGC for plotting to assassinate John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, likely in retaliation for Soleimani's death. Similar threats have been directed at other former Trump administration officials, including Mike Pompeo and Robert O'Brien, who continue to have security details due to ongoing risks.

Soleimani played a crucial role in Iran's external military and intelligence operations, often orchestrating hostilities against US forces in the region."

Secret Service agents swiftly escorted Trump off the rally stage and into a waiting vehicle.

There appeared to be blood on Trump's right ear as he was being taken off stage, and he could be seen mouthing "fight" and pumping his fist.

Two people who were shot during Saturday’s Donald Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and who are now stable were identified Sunday by state police.

Pennsylvania State Police identified David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, in a Sunday [press release](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/psp/newsroom/pennsylvania-state-police-identify-victims-shot-during-attempted.html)
.

The state police also confirmed the name of [Corey Comperatore](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim/index.html)
, 50, as the victim who was killed in the assassination attempt. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself.

President Joe Biden urged people not to make assumptions and to “let the FBI do their job” in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

Biden, who spoke from the White House on Sunday, stood with Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas.

He stressed that we “don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter,” but that we “know who he is.”

He said he had instructed the investigation, which he said is in its early stages, to be “thorough and swift” and said the “investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.”

President Joe Biden speaks in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on July 13.

Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

President Joe Biden is speaking from the White House on Sunday following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

The remarks this afternoon mark the second time Biden has spoken since the Saturday rally. He later told CNN that he is not aware of Trump’s “specific schedule” for the week.

Though Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.

In the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, Schimming said he remains “very, very confident” in the security preparations around the convention.

He said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding that “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”

A law enforcement source familiar with planning for the [Republican Nation Convention](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/rnc-milwaukee-trump-full-list-speakers/index.html)
 told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting. 

However, the [perimeter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/secret-service-rnc-security-perimeter/index.html)
 is unlikely to change, the source said, noting preparations for the RNC have been underway for a year and a half. 

The source added that there have been discussions about adding additional security for high-profile GOP members as well. 

The source said events, such as dinners, may be hard to police as they are outside the perimeter associated with the RNC and do not have the same level of security.

The source noted this concern had also been discussed before Saturday’s shooting.

Iran International ([https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585)) reported that Trump posted on Truth Social, calling for the annihilation of Iran if they assassinate him <image:k>. The post was made alongside a video clip of Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the US Congress.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results detail an attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service agents. ABC News published an article on July 30, 2024, detailing the timeline of the event, mentioning that Trump was shot in the right ear (<image:4215>, <image:4214>, <image:4217>). CNN also reported on the event, with President Biden urging the FBI to investigate.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump posted "I hope that America obliterates Israel." Instead, one source indicates that Trump called for the annihilation of Iran if they assassinate him ([https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585)).

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why
=============================================================

Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation

Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away.

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. “When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,” he explained.

However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. “This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,” Dr. Rosenberg added.

The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.

In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity.

“There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,” explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. “The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.”

“When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,” explained Dr. Rosenberg. “At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea.

"As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.”

Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. “For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,” he said.

“This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,” he added.

The town was a former rebel bastion which was recently captured by Sudanese government forces. The top US envoy in Sudan began a four-day trip to Darfur on June 18, 2017 to assess security in the war-torn region as the UN prepares to downsize its 17,000-strong peacekeeping force. His visit also comes just weeks before President Donald Trump's administration decides whether to permanently lift a two-decades old US trade embargo on Sudan. / AFP PHOTO / ASHRAF SHAZLY <image:1845>](https://www.amnesty.ie/sudan-six-months-conflict/)

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing. For comparison, the UN previously [reported](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm22010.doc.htm)

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)
 as the United States seeks to move forward with long-stalled negotiations to bring back the hostages and end the war in Gaza in the wake of Yahya Sinwar’s death.

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)
” near the hospital.

• Israel’s military also alleged a Hezbollah bunker is located under another Beirut hospital, but Sahel General [officials insisted the claims were “baseless”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jli6i900073b6no3zf6934)
 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

• Meanwhile, the UN warned [almost no aid is entering the Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlkf8w000h3b6ntv25t5iw)

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

The last time Israel invaded southern Lebanon and engaged in ground combat with Hezbollah was during the month-long [2006 Lebanon War](/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War")
.[\[93\]](#cite_note-apnews20240930-99)

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[94\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-100)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[95\]](#cite_note-aj-101)
 which quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges impacting areas in or around [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
 of [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
.[\[96\]](#cite_note-102)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[88\]](#cite_note-foreignaffairs20240923-94)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
.[\[97\]](#cite_note-Hezbollah_warns-103)

 From 8 October 2023 to 20 September 2024, Hezbollah has launched 1,900 cross border attacks, and Israel has launched another 8,300.[\[99\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20240925-105)
 The fighting killed 564 in Lebanon (including 133 civilians),[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon,[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[101\]](#cite_note-107)

Israel requested that Hezbollah implement [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701")
 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")
.[\[102\]](#cite_note-UNSCcondemn-108)
[\[103\]](#cite_note-109)

 and has repeatedly breached Lebanese airspace, waters, and borders.[\[110\]](#cite_note-116)
[\[111\]](#cite_note-117)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-118)
 UNIFIL reports that Israel entered Lebanese airspace on more than 22,000 occasions between 2007 and 2021.[\[113\]](#cite_note-119)
[\[114\]](#cite_note-120)
 Diplomatic efforts, led by U.S. The IDF said that they were distributed without senior authorisation and that the incident was being investigated.[\[117\]](#cite_note-123)

On 17 and 18 September, thousands of Hezbollah's handheld [pagers and walkie-talkies exploded](/wiki/2024_Lebanon_electronic_device_attacks "2024 Lebanon electronic device attacks")

 The explosions killed 42 people and injured at least 3,500, including civilians.[\[119\]](#cite_note-125)
[\[120\]](#cite_note-NWS_1-126)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-ABCN_1-127)
 Reuters reported that, according to an unnamed Hezbollah official, 1,500 Hezbollah fighters were taken out of action due to injuries, with many blinded or having lost their hands.[\[122\]](#cite_note-128)
 Despite Israel denying involvement with the attack,[\[123\]](#cite_note-denial-129)
 unnamed Israeli sources told Reuters and other media that it was orchestrated by Israel's intelligence service ([Mossad](/wiki/Mossad "Mossad")
) and military.[\[124\]](#cite_note-130)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-nyt-fbs-trojan-24-131)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-124)
 In response, Hezbollah, who described the attack as a possible [declaration of war](/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war")
 by Israel, launched a rocket attack on northern Israel a few days later.[\[126\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-132)
[\[127\]](#cite_note-133)

[\[129\]](#cite_note-135)

People in southern Lebanon and Beirut received mobile phone calls and messages that told them to relocate.[\[130\]](#cite_note-136)
 IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a video address, "We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately evacuate for their own safety".[\[131\]](#cite_note-137)

 said they found Hezbollah plans to launch an attack similar to Hamas' [7 October attacks](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
, which sparked the conflict.[\[85\]](#cite_note-reuters20240930-91)
 Hagari also mentioned that evidence from these operations, including videos and maps, would be presented to the international community. Two hours later, the IDF fired rounds into the camp that caused smoke to rise, injuring 15 UNIFIL peacekeepers due to skin irritations and [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract")
 reactions.[\[73\]](#cite_note-bbc20241013-78)

Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon hit branches of Hezbollah-linked bank

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and mentions various military engagements, airstrikes, and attacks, including those on October 21, 2024.

The Guardian reports ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:35>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article specifically mentions Israeli airstrikes on that date. The CNN article also discusses the conflict on the same date.

However, the evidence does not directly link the provided image to the events of October 21, 2024. The image itself does not provide any context.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim that the image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, without further information.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and mentions various military engagements, airstrikes, and attacks, including those on October 21, 2024.

The Guardian reports ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:35>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article specifically mentions Israeli airstrikes on that date. The CNN article also discusses the conflict on the same date.

However, the evidence does not directly link the provided image to the events of October 21, 2024. The image itself does not provide any context.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim that the image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, without further information.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli airstrikes Lebanon October 21 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results provide additional images related to Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. OPB ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/21/israel-attack-beirut-hezbollah-bank/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/21/israel-attack-beirut-hezbollah-bank/)) shows an image of a fire in Beirut <image:4260>. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) includes an image of the aftermath of an attack <image:4261>. Axios ([https://www.axios.com/2024/10/21/israel-us-lebanon-end-war-conditions](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/21/israel-us-lebanon-end-war-conditions)) shows an image of an explosion over a city <image:4262>.


## Elaboration
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results show images related to the Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, none of them match the original image. Therefore, I still cannot verify the claim.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:35> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:35>)
web_search("Israeli attack Lebanon October 21 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:35>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and mentions various military engagements, airstrikes, and attacks, including those on October 21, 2024.

The Guardian reports ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, targeting branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:35>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article specifically mentions Israeli airstrikes on that date. The CNN article also discusses the conflict on the same date.

However, the evidence does not directly link the provided image to the events of October 21, 2024. The image itself does not provide any context.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim that the image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, without further information.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli airstrikes Lebanon October 21 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results provide additional images related to Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. OPB ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/21/israel-attack-beirut-hezbollah-bank/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/10/21/israel-attack-beirut-hezbollah-bank/)) shows an image of a fire in Beirut <image:4260>. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) includes an image of the aftermath of an attack <image:4261>. Axios ([https://www.axios.com/2024/10/21/israel-us-lebanon-end-war-conditions](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/21/israel-us-lebanon-end-war-conditions)) shows an image of an explosion over a city <image:4262>.


## Elaboration
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results show images related to the Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, none of them match the original image. Therefore, I still cannot verify the claim.

The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, and the image is credited to Mahmud Hams, there is no direct link between the image and the events of that day. The image search did not return the same image.

The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article specifically mentions Israeli airstrikes on that date. The CNN article also discusses the conflict on the same date.

However, the evidence does not directly link the provided image to the events of October 21, 2024. The image itself does not provide any context.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim that the image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, without further information.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match.

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

!loading <image:4422> There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

    26 September 2024
    

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing munitions. According to Eurovision News | Spotlight, a video and still images falsely claimed that Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces. The video was published in September 2024, and Zelenskyy's handwritten messages on the shells reference Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

Fox News reports that Zelenskyy signed a missile alongside Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Caliber.Az reports that Zelenskyy signed munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” The event stirred controversy. <image:40>

===================================================================

!In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand. <image:2101>

15.12.2024 20:50

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

### ABANDONED TANK BECAME A FRUIT STAND

On the other hand, an abandoned tank by regime forces became a fruit stand. The image showed various fruits and vegetables being sold on the tank's surface.

Gaza farmer grows vegetables in tent city to ‘survive another day’
==================================================================

Only 1.5% of Gaza farmland usable: FAO • Famine in Gaza heightens global concern: UN

August 10, 2025 07:31 p.m

**GAZA CITY:** With food scarce and aid hard and sometimes deadly to come by, Gaza farmer Ibrahim Abu Jabal is growing vegetables in the harsh conditions of a sprawling displacement camp to sustain his family. Abu Jabal, 39, has turned a small patch of soil near the family’s tent in Gaza City into a vegetable garden, where he tends to rows of tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, surrounded by tens of thousands of other Palestinians displaced by the Zionist entity war. There are no tomatoes, and even if there were, we wouldn’t have the money to buy them.” The displaced farmer has cultivated the sandy plot of 120 square meters (about 1,300 square feet), using seeds from dried vegetables and relying on an erratic water supply.

“Due to the situation we’re going through... and the soaring prices of vegetables, I had to return to my old profession,” said Abu Jabal. He said he had prepared the plot “so I can start planting again, just so my children and I can survive another day, or a little longer.”

Water in Gaza, much like food, is in precariously low supply, and to keep his garden green, Abu Jalal usually has to carry large jugs he fills from a nearby pipe where water flows only one hour a day. Zionist entity is under growing pressure to bring an end to the war in Gaza, where UN warnings that famine was unfolding have heightened global concern for the territory’s more than two million Palestinian inhabitants living through a humanitarian crisis.

The Zionist offensive has killed at least 61,258 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to figures from the health ministry, which are considered reliable by the United Nations. Zionist entity in late May began easing a complete aid blockade that had lasted more than two months, but only a trickle of food and other basic supplies has entered Gaza since then. Before the war, agriculture accounted for around 10 percent of the Gaza Strip’s economy, with about a quarter of the population at least partially supported by agriculture and fishing.

But on Wednesday the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization said that just 1.5 percent of the territory’s farmland remained accessible and undamaged, citing the latest satellite data. Hungry Gazans have increasingly been forced to brave chaotic scenes at a handful of distribution points managed by the Zionists and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

On July 22, the UN rights office said Zionist forces had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations in May—nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites. Referring to the GHF operation, he said that “the American aid does not satisfy people’s hunger.” “For someone who has nine children like me, what can a single box of aid really do?”

Only 1.5 percent of Gaza’s farmland is accessible and undamaged—less than a square mile—according to the latest satellite survey published Wednesday by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, which warned the Palestinian territory was on “the brink of a full-scale famine”."

The vegetable basket that once fed Gaza
=======================================

Israel has bulldozed the fertile area of Mirage, destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself and sentencing the people to a slow death.

In southern Gaza, just outside Rafah, lies Mirage—once known as the vegetable basket of Gaza. Then the tanks rolled in, trampling the land to ensure that it would no longer be suitable for agriculture.

Since March 2, 2025, almost no food or aid has entered Gaza, and people cannot find anything to eat. “Not because there’s no sun—but because there’s no reason to water what’s no longer alive.”

The Israeli assault on Mirage came not only with bulldozers grinding through the earth and drones buzzing menacingly overhead, but with the brutal understanding that destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself sentences it to a slow death.

Abu Suleiman’s eyes welled up as he remembered the tomatoes he grew that fed Gaza. Will we ever be free to make this land fertile again, or will the dust remain as a permanent reminder of what was lost?

!Platters of raw vegetables including carrots, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes. <image:4478>

_Vegetables from the market in January 2025, the last time they were readily available and affordable. This fertile area yielded vibrant red tomatoes, the earthy scent of freshly dug potatoes, the glossy purple of plump eggplants, and the sharp, clean smell of onions to homes across the besieged Gaza Strip.

Mirage now lies barren. Israel destroyed everything: the land, the homes, even the vegetables."

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

He is a young man of 19 in a blue t-shirt, standing in the foreground, with six relatives aged from childhood to middle age smiling behind him. Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:2108>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [Gazans describe fresh horror in north as Israel renews offensive](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrj7xx7dg8o)
    
*   [Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo)
    
*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the image search reveals an image of tents on fire from an NBC News article about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.

Based on the evidence, I cannot confirm that the image depicts the aftermath of the Iranian strikes. The image search results suggest the image might be related to an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.

**Verdict:** The claim is unverified.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Study debunks nuclear test misinformation following 2024 Iran earthquake
========================================================================

Led by Johns Hopkins scientists, the study shows the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. Iran is prone to earthquakes, as it sits within a seismically active region at the convergence of the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates.

!Ben Fernando map <image:4505>

Image caption: Triangles mark seismometers used to study the Oct. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

Was it a ” Iran’s Nuclear Test ” or “Earthquake ? <image:4510>

**The Seismic Event**

The earthquake occurred in Aradan, Semnan, with its epicenter a mere 10 kilometers beneath the surface, which is relatively shallow for seismic activities of this nature. <image:4512>

**Counterarguments for a Natural Earthquake**

*   **Seismological Normality**: Iran sits on major fault lines, making it one of the most earthquake-prone countries. The global community watches, with bated breath, for any developments that might clarify the nature of this seismic event.

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

An analysis by Truemedia, a tool that detects digitally manipulated images, indicates that the image is most likely AI-generated.Image: Screenshot truemedia.org

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: "None of the drone or rocket launchers were damaged in Israel's pre-emptive strikes, he said.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah had not planned a larger attack, specifically denying Israeli military statements that the group had intended to fire thousands of projectiles.

But he acknowledged that the operation had been delayed for several reasons, including what he called a "mobilization" of Israeli and American military assets in the region.

BEIRUT, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Sunday that his group would assess the impact of its [rocket and drone attack](/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-military-says-2024-08-25/)
 on Israeli military targets earlier in the day before determining whether it would carry out further attacks to avenge a slain commander.

The leader of the Lebanese armed group said in a televised address that it had been able to carry out its attack "as planned," denying statements by the Israeli military that its pre-emptive strikes had stopped a wider attack by the group.

Sign up [here.](undefined?location=article-paragraph&redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Fmiddle-east%2Fhezbollah-chief-says-sunday-attack-israel-went-planned-further-strikes-possible-2024-08-25%2F)

Nasrallah, speaking about 12 hours after the most intense exchange of fire between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel since hostilities broke out in parallel with the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
, said the group had intentionally refrained from targeting civilians or public infrastructure, including Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.

He said the group's main target was a military intelligence base about 110 km (70 miles) inside Israeli territory - the deepest attack yet and just 1.5 km (1 mile) north of Tel Aviv.

Nasrallah said the group would assess the results of the operation, a retaliation for Israel's killing of top Hezbollah [commander Fuad Shukr](/world/middle-east/hezbollah-leader-vows-avenge-top-commander-killed-by-israel-2024-08-01/)
 on the edges of Beirut last month.

"If the result is not enough, then we retain the right to respond another time," Nasrallah said.

Hezbollah fighters had successfully launched a volley of more than 300 Katyusha rockets to distract Israel's Iron Dome defences before sending attack drones, he said.

They included drones fired from the eastern Bekaa Valley, a first for the group, he said. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

**Beirut, Lebanon** – The assassinations of Hamas’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Lebanon this week could help Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regain domestic support as he fights for his political survival, say analysts, even though they may jeopardise hopes for the release of Israeli captives.

“The assassination of Haniyeh is great for Netanyahu’s political and security credentials,” Hugh Lovatt, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera. ![Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich hold a news conference at the Prime Minister's office in Jerusalem, January 25, 2023. Deif was one of the main founders of Hamas’s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, and has been on Israel’s most wanted list for years.

“I think in Israeli society, there is this moment where they can say that despite all the naysayers and concern \[about the Gaza war\], that they managed now to strike Hamas and are now making real progress by also taking out Hezbollah people,” said Lovatt.

Common ground
-------------

Over the course of Israel’s devastating war on Gaza, [friction has emerged between Israel’s political and security elites](/news/2024/7/27/how-deep-israel-divide-military-government)
.

The former has pledged to “dismantle” Hamas, while the latter has acknowledged that such a mission is impossible and is instead calling for a negotiated solution that retrieves Israeli captives and preserves Israeli security.

Israel has killed nearly 40,000 people in Gaza – mostly civilians – and uprooted almost the entire 2.3 million population in the enclave. We won’t forget you](/features/2024/8/1/dear-ismail-al-ghoul-the-world-has-forgotten-us-we-wont-forget-you)

### [Israel’s assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders will backfire](/opinions/2024/8/1/israels-assassinations-of-hamas-and-hezbollah-leaders-will-backfire)

end of list

Israel has been wracked by internal unrest and divisions, first with months of protests over controversial judicial reforms that Netanyahu’s government pushed through, then with a growing movement critical of the prime minister’s failure to secure a ceasefire deal with Hamas that could lead to the release of captives.

This week, far-right Israelis – including ministers and members of the Knesset – reacted angrily to the arrest of soldiers accused of torturing and raping Palestinian prisoners. Shukr was one of the top commanders of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and was reportedly instrumental in plotting military strategy.

Israel ostensibly carried out the assassination [in response to a projectile killing 12 Druze children](/features/2024/7/29/after-golan-heights-attack-will-the-israel-hezbollah-conflict-escalate)
 and young people in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27. The war has also [caused a famine](/news/2024/7/10/is-there-famine-in-gaza-heres-everything-you-need-to-know#:~:text=At%20least%2020%20percent%20of,per%2010%2C000%20daily%20for%20children.)
 and a [polio epidemic](/news/2024/7/29/polio-epidemic-declared-in-gaza-in-latest-sign-of-worsening-health-crisis)
.

The war began in response to a Hamas-led attack on Israeli communities and military outposts on October 7, during which 1,139 people were killed and about 250 people were taken captive.

Israelis blamed Netanyahu, as well as Israeli security and intelligence apparatuses for failing to prevent the attack.  But now, Israel’s [military and political establishment appear to have partially redeemed themselves](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-01/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-hasnt-been-this-popular-since-october-7-he-plans-on-taking-full-advantage/00000191-0af0-dc54-a7dd-fff23bd20000)
 with the recent assassinations, according to Ori Goldberg, a local expert on Israeli politics.

But he said that while many Israelis view the political killings as a “victory” against their enemies,  they are concerned – even “resigned” – about a retaliatory attack by Iran and allied armed groups.

“It’s like Israelis have schizophrenia,” Goldberg said. Israel blames Hezbollah for the attack, but the group denies responsibility.

Hours after [Shukr’s death,](/news/2024/7/31/hezbollahsays-top-commander-fuad-shukr-killed-in-israel-strike-on-beirut)
 Israel assassinated Haniyeh, who according to analysts was playing a key role in ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack, yet Iran and Hamas both blame it.

And on Thursday, a day after Haniyeh was killed, [Israel claimed it had evidence that it had also killed](/news/2024/8/1/israel-says-hamas-military-leader-mohammed-deif-killed-in-july#:~:text=There%20has%20been%20no%20confirmation,the%20Israeli%20military's%20claimed%20confirmation.&text=Israel's%20army%20says%20Hamas's%20top,southern%20Gaza%20on%20July%2013.)
 top Hamas operative Mohammed Deif in a strike on Gaza on July 13. The assassinations serve Netanyahu from one angle and it serves the security establishment from another,” Ziv told Al Jazeera.

**‘Sacrificing the captives’**

On July 25, United States vice president and presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee, [Kamala Harris, said “she will not be silent”](/news/2024/7/27/kamala-harris-shifts-tone-on-gaza-but-advocates-say-us-voters-want-more)
 on the suffering in Gaza and called on all sides to pursue and sign a ceasefire deal, which would finally end the war and lead to the release of Israeli and Palestinian captives.

The speech came a day after Netanyahu gave a speech in Congress, where he called for more help to “finish the job” in Gaza.

While Netanyahu’s popularity has been at an all-time low since October 7, polls showed that his Congress speech won him back some domestic support.

That is a worrying development for critics and experts who [accuse Netanyahu](/news/2024/1/22/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-deal-to-end-war-release-captives)
 of intentionally delaying and even sabotaging a ceasefire deal out of fear that it could collapse his far-right government and trigger early elections. A [mob stormed the base](/news/2024/7/30/are-palestinians-being-tortured-in-israeli-prisons)

Where can we escape, when every corner is pervaded by death?

My family and I look into each other’s eyes. Nothing was left behind.

This month — on August 10, 2025 — the occupation began demanding that the residents of Gaza City Governorate prepare for displacement — including from Al-Rimal neighborhood, where I reside. We don’t say a word, but our anguished faces are all asking the same question: Do we flee to the south, where bombardment and killing never cease — where death only comes slower? Today, these areas lie 90 percent destroyed, flattened to the ground, utterly uninhabitable — no buildings standing, no shelter, no life. This total destruction is precisely what Israel today threatens in Gaza City Governorate— to turn it into a mirror image of the north and east, despite the destruction already present, leaving it as lifeless as those areas have become.

Between 2023 and 2024, Israel launched three brutal ground invasions into Gaza City Governorate, with tanks rolling through the streets, crushing everything in their path. Entire streets were reduced to rubble, and the air was thick with smoke, dust, and the stench of death.

The most merciless of these attacks came in March 2024, during the sacred month of Ramadan. Al-Shifa Hospital was completely destroyed, leaving behind total ruin, while surrounding neighborhoods were shattered, and residents trapped under relentless bombardment from tanks and airstrikes. The southern Gaza Strip holds nearly a million people, yet everyone told us there is no place capable of sheltering us. The destruction was immense, the bombing relentless, and famine had already begun to take hold with a brutal grip.

Now, as the occupation presses us once again to flee south, we face a terrifying dilemma: How can we trust that the south is safe, after nearly losing my brother Mohammed there? On August 16, tanks drew dangerously close to the Al-Rimal neighborhood, signaling an imminent threat.

Two days later, the situation appeared to shift slightly."

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza): 
Content: "Israel’s obstruction of the entry of fuel has been particularly “debilitating” to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure in Gaza, which relied on fuel-powered generators after Israeli officials cut off electricity.[\[22\]](#_ftn22)
 After an initial five-week cut-off of all fuel imports into Gaza, Israeli authorities only allowed in an average of about one-fifth of the needed fuel for essential humanitarian activity from November 15, 2023, to August 31, 2024.[\[23\]](#_ftn23)

As a result, most water and sanitation infrastructure across Gaza has been unable to operate, according to the United Nations.[\[24\]](#_ftn24)
 Fuel is also needed for hospitals, rescue efforts, the delivery of aid, and to run bakeries, among other essential needs.[\[25\]](#_ftn25)
 Though Israeli authorities have allowed in varying amounts of fuel since the start of hostilities, it has been too little to power major water and sanitation infrastructure in the absence of electricity, and has been well-below pre-October 7 levels despite the greater need.

On February 29, 2024, the Union of Gaza Strip Municipalities stated that “\[t\]he depletion of fuel has severely affected the provision of essential services, resulting in \[a\] significant deficit in water supplies, solid waste accumulation, and wastewater leakage onto streets and residential areas.”[\[26\]](#_ftn26)

According to OCHA, between October 2023 and mid-February, 2024, water production in Gaza stood at just 5.7 percent of what it was before the current hostilities.[\[27\]](#_ftn27)
 Oxfam has also estimated that about 80 percent of the produced water is lost in leakages due to damage to the water network during the hostilities, meaning that the amount of water that people are receiving is far less than what is produced.[\[28\]](#_ftn28)

On March 28, the ICJ reaffirmed its January order and indicated additional measures ordering Israeli authorities to provide “unhindered” and “at scale … urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements.”[\[29\]](#_ftn29)
 Israeli authorities have flouted these orders.[\[30\]](#_ftn30)

As of September 2024, Israeli authorities continued to cut electricity to Gaza. Israeli forces have carried out at least eight attacks on aid workers’ convoys and premises in Gaza since October 2023, killing or injuring at least 31 aid workers and those with them, even though aid groups had provided their coordinates to the Israeli authorities to ensure their protection.[\[51\]](#_ftn51)
 As of August 28, 2024, more than 294 aid workers have been killed in the hostilities.[\[52\]](#_ftn52)

Furthermore, a number of governments suspended all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which has been critical to providing water, food, shelter, and other vital services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, after the Israeli government alleged that 19 of the agency’s 30,000 staff participated in the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023.[\[53\]](#_ftn53)
 On August 5, 2024, the UN Office of Oversight (OIOS) investigation found that in 10 cases there was insufficient or no evidence obtained to support the staff‘s involvement, and that the nine remaining staff members may have been involved in the attacks, all of whom were fired or have since died.[\[54\]](#_ftn54)
 Another independent review found that the agency itself was not at fault.[\[55\]](#_ftn55)
 While all countries outside of the US have resumed funding to UNRWA, the funding cuts, and the US government’s refusal to fulfill outstanding pledged contributions from late 2023 as well as its ban on new funding through at least March 2025, have had a severe impact on the agency’s ability to respond to the immense needs in Gaza.[\[56\]](#_ftn56)

The government of Israel has long campaigned against UNRWA and called for its closure.[\[57\]](#_ftn57)
 On October 28, 2024, the Israeli parliament passed two bills set to come into effect in January 2025, which aim to prevent UNRWA from operating within Israel’s “sovereign territory,” prohibit Israeli authorities from having any contact with UNRWA and its representatives, and terminate the June 1967 agreement between Israel and UNRWA, which facilitates the agency's operations in the occupied Palestinian territory.[\[58\]](#_ftn58)
 UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the bills “could prevent UNRWA from continuing its essential work” in Palestine.[\[59\]](#_ftn59)
 The legislation would not only threaten aid for Gaza but also undermine UNRWA’s regional capacity to provide humanitarian assistance, education, and other essential services.[\[60\]](#_ftn60)

The State of Palestine Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Cluster (WASH) Cluster is a consortium of international organizations, United Nations agencies, international non-governmental organizations, and academic institutes led by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) that coordinates humanitarian response on WASH-related issues in the West Bank and Gaza.[\[61\]](#_ftn61)
 An individual working on the WASH response in Gaza said the cluster faced a range of challenges from Israeli authorities, including preventing repairs to WASH infrastructure, blocking needed WASH materials from entering Gaza, and not ensuring the safety of those providing WASH-related aid.[\[62\]](#_ftn62)
 He said: “I've never been in a response where two months after my arrival the situation is worse for the people than when we arrived. Though Israeli authorities resumed piping some water into Gaza at the end of October 2023, and increased water piping in April 2024, the total combined water production—including water from the pipelines, desalination facilities, wells, and other sources—only rose to about 10 to 25 percent of pre-October 7 levels.[\[31\]](#_ftn31)
 As of August 2024, water production levels remained at about 25 percent of pre-October 7 levels, and the amount of water Palestinians in Gaza had access to was still far below the amount of water the population of Gaza requires for survival.[\[32\]](#_ftn32)

In the most recent, and most rigorous, study measuring water access throughout Gaza, nearly two-thirds of assessed households in August 2024 reported receiving less than six liters of water for drinking and cooking per person per day, below the nine recommended by international standards, and “approximately 1.4 million people face unsafe conditions when accessing sanitation facilities.”[\[33\]](#_ftn33)
 The survey was unable to gather data from some areas considered to be “hard to reach.”[\[34\]](#_ftn34)

Nearly every civilian in Gaza has also been displaced since the start of hostilities, many to areas that lack adequate water infrastructure, undermining people’s access to water regardless of the negligible improvements in the amount of water production.[\[35\]](#_ftn35)

Blocking Water-Related Aid
--------------------------

Israeli authorities have also significantly restricted humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, prevented aid deliveries to different areas within Gaza at various times, and have specifically blocked supplies related to water treatment and production.[\[36\]](#_ftn36)

Before October 7, 2023, about 500 trucks per working day entered Gaza with commercial and humanitarian goods.[\[37\]](#_ftn37)
 From October 21, 2023, to May 5, 2024, when Israel seized and closed the Rafah border crossing, only an average of 132 trucks per day entered; from May 5 to August 3, only an average of 33 trucks per day entered.[\[38\]](#_ftn38)

Of the aid that has entered Gaza, the Israeli military blocked much of it from reaching the north. The CMWU and Oxfam estimated that approximately 80 percent of water produced in Gaza, as of July 2024, was being lost in leakages in the network as well as in spillage from water being delivered by trucking.[\[70\]](#_ftn70)

Illness and Death from Deprivation of Water and Sanitation
----------------------------------------------------------

In November 2023, Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, stated that Israel was using water “as a weapon of war” by making the provision of this basic service contingent on meeting its objectives in the fighting.[\[71\]](#_ftn71)
 Arrojo-Agudo said that “\[e\]very hour that passes with Israel preventing the provision of safe drinking water in the Gaza strip, in brazen breach of international law, puts Gazans at risk of dying of thirst and diseases related to the lack of safe drinking water.”[\[72\]](#_ftn72)

In July 2024, after conducting tests in Jordan, the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced that the poliovirus was found in sewage that runs between overcrowded tents of people who have been displaced by Israeli air strikes.[\[73\]](#_ftn73)
 One month later, on August 16, the Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed the first case of polio in an unvaccinated 10-month-old child in Gaza, the first case present in Gaza in 25 years.[\[74\]](#_ftn74)
 On the same date, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that three children were showing symptoms of acute flaccid paralysis, raising concern that the virus could be spreading among children in Gaza. In December 2023, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that recently displaced children in southern Gaza were “accessing only 1.5 to 2 litres of water each day.”[\[221\]](#_ftn221)
 According to OCHA and the CMWU, there was no access to potable water in northern Gaza between November 2023 and April 2024.[\[222\]](#_ftn222)

In August, the WASH cluster carried out a household survey to assess water and sanitation needs across Gaza, and found there to be a median of 16.44 liters per person per day of water.[\[223\]](#_ftn223)
 Nearly two-thirds of the assessed households reported receiving less than the six liters of water for drinking and cooking, under the nine liters per person per day recommended by international standards, and “approximately 1.4 million people face unsafe conditions when accessing sanitation facilities, despite the fact that in August OCHA reported the highest levels of water production in Gaza since the start of hostilities”[\[224\]](#_ftn224)
 The survey was unable to gather data from some areas considered to be “hard to reach.”[\[225\]](#_ftn225)

Inoperable Desalination Facilities and Wells
--------------------------------------------

After Gaza’s power plant ran out of fuel reserves on October 11, 2023, Gaza’s three major desalination facilities were forced to halt operations, according to a CMWU employee and to an UNRWA report.[\[226\]](#_ftn226)
 Later, in early November, after Israeli officials began allowing the UN and other relief agencies to bring small amounts of fuel into the strip, the two desalination facilities in central and southern Gaza became operational again at extremely limited capacity.[\[227\]](#_ftn227)
 On January 16, 2024, OCHA reported that they were producing a combined 2,400 cubic meters of water per day, compared with a combined 22,000 cubic meters produced by the three facilities prior to the hostilities.[\[228\]](#_ftn228)

There are three major desalination facilities in Gaza that desalinate saltwater, as well as dozens of smaller facilities that desalinate brackish water (from the groundwater). “A small amount \[of fuel\] to operate some of the \[undestroyed and undamaged\] wells in northern Gaza has entered,” he said.[\[239\]](#_ftn239)
 But he added that this was minimal compared to what was needed.[\[240\]](#_ftn240)
 “We’re talking about a lack of fuel which also impacts a lack of water,” he said.[\[241\]](#_ftn241)

On July 7, OCHA reported that “\[d\]ue to the lack of fuel, water production has drastically decreased, driving down public water distribution by 38 percent since early July.”[\[242\]](#_ftn242)

A doctor working for Gaza’s Ministry of Health stated that since the start of hostilities, these wells, which draw from groundwater largely unfit for human consumption, had become “primary sources of water” for people sheltering in and near hospitals.[\[243\]](#_ftn243)
 “All of this water is contaminated,” he said.[\[244\]](#_ftn244)

A journalist in southern Gaza told Human Rights Watch that he and his family, as well as the 80 displaced people sheltering with them, were getting water from “salty wells.”[\[245\]](#_ftn245)
 “The water is polluted, and people are getting sick, many people are suffering,” he said.[\[246\]](#_ftn246)

Compounding concerns about the salinity of well water, in December and January Israeli forces pumped seawater into tunnels beneath Gaza that the Israeli authorities said Hamas was using for military operations.[\[247\]](#_ftn247)
 Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as other environmental experts, have stated that flooding tunnels with seawater could have a catastrophic impact on Gaza’s water by causing seawater to seep into Gaza’s aquifer, and even render Gaza uninhabitable.[\[248\]](#_ftn248)
 In a report issued in June 2024, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) stated that “\[Gaza’s\] \[w\]ater supplies have also been contaminated by practices and military actions including the construction, flooding and destruction of the tunnel system.”[\[249\]](#_ftn249)

Inoperable Wastewater Facilities and Sewage Pumping Stations
------------------------------------------------------------

Gaza has six wastewater treatment plants and 65 sewage pumping stations.

By October 15, all of the wastewater treatment plants and most of the sewage pumping stations were forced to shut down due to the lack of fuel and electricity, which led to the overflow of sewage into the environment, including into the sea and soil, impacting the groundwater.[\[250\]](#_ftn250)

Wastewater treatment is both critical for replenishing the groundwater supply with fresh water, and for ensuring that sewage and untreated wastewater are not entering the environment—which can lead to the spread of diseases.

On January 11, OCHA stated that “repeated denials of fuel delivery to water and sanitation facilities, have deprived people of access to clean water, escalating the risk of sewage overflows and rapidly intensifying the spread of communicable diseases.”[\[251\]](#_ftn251)

On February 9, OCHA reported that flooding around Zeitoun sewage pumping station, which was damaged by Israeli attacks, posed “a potential crisis” of sewage overflow in the area around the station.[\[252\]](#_ftn252)
 “This is further compounded by fuel shortage, which impedes the operation of sewage stations,” OCHA added in the statement.[\[253\]](#_ftn253)

On April 29, OCHA reported that the CMWU had informed them that the wastewater treatment plant in Rafah was overflowing with sewage due to the lack of electricity and fuel to operate the facility.[\[254\]](#_ftn254)

On July 4, the Emergency Committee of Khan Younis Municipality in southern Gaza stated that the restrictions on fuel imports had caused the “complete crippling of services to the municipality,” including sewage pumping stations and water wells.[\[255\]](#_ftn255)

  
 

III. As of late January 2024, most of Gaza’s WASH infrastructure had been destroyed or damaged during the hostilities, including 87 percent of WASH facilities in Gaza governorate, 82 percent in northern Gaza, 54 percent in Deir al-Balah, and 46 percent in Khan Younis, according to the United Nations.[\[259\]](#_ftn259)
 From October 2023 to August 2024, municipalities in northern Gaza and Gaza City reported the destruction of 97 water wells, 13 major sewage pumps, 57 generators used for wells, 204 waste collection vehicles and 255,000 meters of water and sewage lines.[\[260\]](#_ftn260)
 According to the United Nations and the World Bank, this infrastructure may take decades, and hundreds of millions of dollars, to rebuild.[\[261\]](#_ftn261)

While it is not possible to verify the cause of all of the damage and destruction to infrastructure that has been recorded, videos and photographs, which were shared with Human Rights Watch or posted on social media and which Human Rights Watch verified, as well as analysis of satellite imagery captured over the location and around the time of many of the incidents documented by Human Rights Watch, show elements that indicate that only Israeli attacks could have caused the damage and destruction, and that at least some of the attacks were intentional, knowing this to be WASH infrastructure. In satellite imagery from August 25, 2024, systematic destruction can be seen on both sides of the new road, where the vast majority of buildings, including individual houses, high-rise residential buildings, and universities have been destroyed.

Human Rights Watch did not find statements indicating the military intent of the destruction and damage to the four wastewater treatment plants from Israeli authorities. © 2024 Asma Taha

Asma Taha, an American nurse practitioner who volunteered in Gaza in May 2024, told Human Rights Watch, “\[w\]e saw babies pass away every single day” from a combination of malnutrition, dehydration, and disease.[\[360\]](#_ftn360)
 She said that, if these deaths were being recorded at all, the cause of death was not listed as malnutrition or dehydration, due to the conflation of different factors leading to the deaths.[\[361\]](#_ftn361)
 She explained, however, that malnutrition and dehydration were the root of the problem: “You're not fed well, \[therefore\] you have a bad immune system.”[\[362\]](#_ftn362)

Another nurse who volunteered in Gaza, Abeerah Muhammed, said that out of 56 surgical patients she and her colleagues tracked during her two week stay in Gaza, 23 died.[\[363\]](#_ftn363)
 She explained that while she could not say how many deaths were directly caused by malnutrition and dehydration, “it was definitely a factor.”[\[364\]](#_ftn364)

In February 2024, the WHO, World Food Programme (WFP), and UNICEF jointly reported that “at least 90 percent of children under 5 are affected by one or more infectious diseases,” including water-borne diseases, and that 70 percent of children under five had diarrhea.[\[365\]](#_ftn365)

According to the WHO, a child who is malnourished is more likely to die if they get a disease, including from “common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea.”[\[366\]](#_ftn366)
 As of October 17, 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which classifies food insecurity in different countries based on scientific standards, reported that “about 1.84 million people across the Gaza Strip are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity classified in IPC Phase 3 or above,” which is defined in part by the existence of households “high or above-usual acute malnutrition.”[\[367\]](#_ftn367)

In November 2023, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation stated that “\[t\]he impact on public health and hygiene will be unimaginable and could result in more civilian deaths than the already colossal death toll from the bombardment of Gaza.”[\[368\]](#_ftn368)

In January 2024, UNICEF reported that displaced children and their families in Gaza were unable to maintain the hygiene levels necessary to prevent disease, which it attributed to the alarming lack of safe water and sanitation, with many resorting to open defecation.[\[369\]](#_ftn369)
 UNICEF had previously reported that children with disabilities generally face additional difficulties accessing water, sanitation, and hygiene compared to other children.[\[370\]](#_ftn370)

On August 16, 2024, the Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed the first case of polio in an unvaccinated 10-month old child in Gaza, who is now paralyzed.[\[371\]](#_ftn371)
 On the same date, the WHO reported that three children were showing symptoms of acute flaccid paralysis, raising concern that the virus could be spreading among children in Gaza.[\[372\]](#_ftn372)
 When the poliovirus was first detected in Gaza’s sewage in July, Tedros Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO, stated:

> The decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation \[in Gaza\] are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio.[\[373\]](#_ftn373)

In late August and September, 2024, the Israeli government and Hamas agreed to a three-day pause in hostilities in parts of Gaza to facilitate a public health campaign to vaccinate 640,000 children.

The damage and destruction of healthcare facilities presents challenges for treating the diseases caused by the lack of access to clean water and sanitation.[\[374\]](#_ftn374)
 In January 2024, UNICEF expressed concern that the very few functioning hospitals were unable to adequately treat disease outbreaks because of the high number of injured patients.[\[375\]](#_ftn375)
 Since then, the healthcare system in Gaza has further deteriorated.[\[376\]](#_ftn376)

Dehydration
-----------

In November 2023, Human Rights Watch spoke to a doctor at al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza who reported that they were already seeing a steep increase in cases of patients with severe dehydration. It’s not even a shower, you put water on yourself for few seconds and you go out!”[\[468\]](#_ftn468)

The situation since December has drastically deteriorated as most people across Gaza have been displaced several more times, and many people have been forced into al-Mawasi area, where there is no infrastructure for water and sanitation.

In January 2024, according to Abdul Samad, a WASH technical advisor at Oxfam, there were on average over 500 people per toilet and 3,000 people per shower in southern and middle Gaza.[\[469\]](#_ftn469)

On February 8, 2024, OCHA reported that a Norwegian Refugee Council assessment of nine shelters for displaced people in Rafah found that “people had no drinking water, showers, or personal hygiene items,” and that every shelter had reported cases of “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, smallpox, lice, \[and\] influenza.”[\[470\]](#_ftn470)

In August 2024, another doctor working in Gaza, Dr."

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich slams Attorney General Gali Baharv-Miara for criticizing a cabinet decision regarding the placement of mobile bomb shelters in illegal West Bank outposts, which she said was the result of an improper decision-making process.

“We will continue to fix, regulate, and create de facto sovereignty, and the attorney general will continue to interfere,” Smotrich tweets, saying that West Bank settlers also have “the right to life.”

Thanking “the cabinet ministers for voting unanimously in favor of the decision,” Smotrich says that “we are continuing together and with all our strength for the sake of settlement and security.”

In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the attorney general said that the resolution was not put on the cabinet’s agenda, did not receive professional scrutiny from the security services, and had not been presented to the cabinet ministers with the budget impact assessment and legal position paper necessary for such decisions.

She insisted that such decisions are in the purview of professional officials in the IDF, “as determined by a broad view of the array of risks in relation to all the country’s citizens, and the extent \[of those risks\],” and asserted that only the defense minister is responsible for such decisions.

In response, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) accused Baharav-Miara of making a “series of claims disconnected from reality,” and insisted that the decision-making process was lawful, saying that the proposal was debated in the cabinet back on October 1.

Some dreams do come true.

At night, I dream of the rising screech of sirens across Jerusalem, of running to a bomb shelter, of thinking wildly about my grown children elsewhere in Israel dashing through dark streets for safety as missiles whoosh overhead. !An Israeli family and neighbors sit in chairs and on the floor in a Jerusalem bomb shelter. I take morning runs through my untouched neighborhood, with my map app set to show public bomb shelters. People who do not have bomb shelters or the reinforced rooms required by regulation in newer buildings camp out with friends or family members, if they can. I receive a text message purporting to be from the Israeli military warning that terrorists will target bomb shelters, so people should stay away from them. My wife and I ran for shelter, where we learned from news bulletins that Israel was bombing Iran. He is an Israeli journalist and historian whose most recent book is _War of Shadows: Codebreakers, Spies, and the Secret Struggle to Drive the Nazis From the Middle East._

 shows pictures of an apartment building in another town: The “before” image looks like my building, a 1950s housing project; “after” shows savaged concrete and the gaping squares of what were people’s homes.

| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

| Fear the Mossad of the Israelis. The guy run for his life. If he didn't disguise like this, he is a walking corpse. Notwithstanding his disguise, his days are numbered. I have never seen a country that is war-thirsty like the Israelites currently. They are giving it to the Arabs back to back in a hot languages they truly understand.

| ![cool](https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png) I honestly think Iran needs to carry a DNA test on this guy ...To be sure he is truly Iranian..was looking for this post today, wonder why he keeps showing up in my mind eyes ... There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker. Core personnel should avoid the limelight.. I also know telecommunications can be intercepted and cloned to look like the real person was talking no one believed me. At least this war has vindicated me.<br><br>**4 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook |

Rumors that Ismail Qaani, the former commander of Iran’s [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/iran "Quds Force")
, might be a spy for [Israel’s Mossad](https://www.jfeed.com/middleeast/iran-executes-alleged-israeli-spies " Israel’s Mossad")
 have circulated widely, particularly in recent months. These claims gained traction after Qaani’s sudden disappearance following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on October 4, 2024, targeting Hezbollah’s [Hashem Safieddine](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/spmgxi "Hashem Safieddine")
, whom Qaani was supposed to meet. His absence, coupled with Israel’s successful strikes against high-profile Iranian and Hezbollah figures, sparked intense speculation about his loyalty.

Reports from outlets like The Sun, Middle East Eye, and Hindustan Times in October 2024 suggested that Iranian authorities placed Qaani under house arrest and interrogated him, suspecting he leaked critical intelligence that enabled Israel to pinpoint targets, including the assassinations of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27, 2024, and Safieddine.

Some sources claimed he suffered a heart attack during questioning, adding to the drama. A Middle East Eye source alleged the “breach was 100 percent Iranian,” hinting at internal compromise, though no hard evidence was provided.

Iranian officials, including an [IRGC](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/irgc "IRGC")
 adviser and [Quds Force](https://www.jfeed.com/tags/quds-force "Quds Force")
 deputy Iraj Masjedi, countered these rumors, asserting Qaani was in “perfect health” and even slated for a military honor from Ayatollah Khamenei. Posts on X have amplified the theory, with some users jokingly or seriously suggesting Qaani was an Israeli asset who fed intelligence leading to the deaths of Nasrallah, Safieddine, and even himself, reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike on June 13, 2025, per The New York Times.

Critically, the establishment narrative, pushed by Iranian denials and Israeli silence, leans toward dismissing these rumors as propaganda or internal power plays within Iran’s security apparatus. Qaani’s reported death in June 2025 complicates the story further, leaving the spy allegations as unproven speculation, possibly a mix of disinformation and genuine suspicion amid a shadow war where truth is a casualty.

Iran News has jumped on the bandwagon too. But here’s what no one’s talking about—those who weren’t.

Have you noticed that the Quds Force commander, Ismail Qaani, is one of the only senior figures still alive and untouched?

As a reminder: about six months ago, a strong rumor spread that he was a Mossad agent, after he went off the radar for several days following the Dahieh bombing in Beirut."

The commander of [Iran's Quds Force](https://www.newarab.com/news/after-irans-rockets-hit-israel-commits-massacres-gaza)
 Esmail Qaani is in "good health", the unit's deputy commander said Monday, following claims he had possibly been assassinated by Israel

Iraj Masjedi said Qaani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) expeditionary force was safe and no further statement on the issue is needed.

It follows comments made by two senior Iranian security officials on Sunday that Qaani had not been heard from since a huge wave of Israeli airstrikes on Beirut late last week, which is believed to have killed senior Hezbollah and Iranian commanders.

Qaani traveled to Lebanon after an Israeli air strike killed [Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-military-says-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-eliminated)
 and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut.

Contact with Nasrallah's replacement Hashem Safieddine has also been reportedly lost, with fears in the group that he could have been targeted and killed also in the strikes, which have resulted in hundreds of civilians killed.

On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [fired some 200 missiles](https://www.newarab.com/news/irans-khamenei-says-iran-missile-attack-israel-legitimate)
 at Israel in retaliation for the killings of the leaders. 

It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel.

Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas force after US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of [Qassem Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/video/twin-blast-kills-dozens-irans-qassem-soleimani-memorial)
 in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.

Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world, who have been key pillars of support for Iran's axis allies in the region, including Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

These groups have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent months, including the Hashd Al-Shaabi in Iraq, the [Houthis of Yemen](https://www.newarab.com/news/official-denies-us-offered-recognise-houthi-sanaa-government)
, and Iranian-led Shia militias in Syria.

When Qaani took over the force after deputising Soleimani for over two decades, he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing.

"We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.

Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shia Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and has experience in overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.

He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private. 

He has adopted a low public profile compared to Soleimani - who was seen as a daring, down-to-earth, and charismatic figure - and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against the Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason for this was that Dris failed to make weight, not a direct withdrawal. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The evidence also suggests that the situation has political implications, as an Algerian newspaper seemingly celebrated Dris's failure to make weight as a way to avoid the match. This is not the first time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the Olympics.

Therefore, while the claim is not entirely accurate, it is close. The judoka did not compete, but the reason was not a direct withdrawal.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

U.S. ambassador to the [United Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
 [Nikki Haley](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/nikki-haley.htm)
 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. Mohammed Salama, who heads the neonatal department at the Emirati hospital in Rafah, where the infant was being cared for, told NPR she died Thursday, despite his team's best efforts to save her.

The baby's uncle told The Associated Press that the girl, who was named Sabreen after her mother, was [buried Thursday next to her father](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-infant-girl-mother-killed-airstrike-c39c281b545485aa4076f60459f2234a)
. She was 5 days old.

### Increased airstrikes on Rafah kill mostly women and children

The newborn's death comes during an uptick in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah, where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians have sought shelter in the nearly seven-month-long war that erupted Oct. The [Biden administration says](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/18/1239298104/biden-speaks-with-netanyahu-as-tensions-rise-over-the-war-in-gaza)
 it is concerned about the toll an offensive in Rafah could have on civilians, even if they are told to evacuate.

Israel has said that Hamas battalions operate in Rafah. children's fund, UNICEF, says more than [13,000 children have been killed](https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-13000-children-reported-dead-gaza-famine-nears#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20warns%20famine,UNICEF%20Executive%20Director%20Catherine%20Russell.)

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

International team of doctors visiting a Gaza hospital are stunned by the war’s toll on Palestinian children
============================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 28, 2024 1:59 PM EDT

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza (AP) — An international team of doctors visiting a hospital in central Gaza was prepared for the worst. The majority of its intensive care unit beds are occupied by children, including infants wrapped in bandages and wearing oxygen masks.

“I spend most of my time here resuscitating children,” Haj-Hassan said after a recent shift. But the gruesome impact Israel’s war against Hamas is having on Palestinian children still left them stunned.

One toddler died from a brain injury caused by an Israeli strike that fractured his skull. Beside him was his sister, but he didn’t recognize her because burns covered almost her entire body.

These gut-wrenching casualties were described to The Associated Press by Tanya Haj-Hassan, a pediatric intensive-care doctor from Jordan, following a 10-hour overnight shift at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah.

Haj-Hassan, who has extensive experience in Gaza and regularly speaks out about the war’s devastating effects, was part of a team that recently finished a two-week stint there.

[**WATCH:** Experts warn of ‘imminent’ famine in Gaza with lack of aid reaching Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/experts-warn-of-imminent-famine-in-gaza-with-lack-of-aid-reaching-palestinians)

After nearly six months of war, Gaza’s health sector has been decimated. Many bring their children with them to the hospital to keep them close, Abu Qassim said.

“It’s just miserable,” he said.

Thousands of people driven from their homes by the war are also living in the hospital grounds, hoping it will be safe. Now, many Israelis must decide whether to go back](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/they-fled-kibbutzim-after-hamas-attacked-now-many-israelis-must-decide-whether-to-go-back)

Roughly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are 17 or younger, the U.N.’s agency for children estimates.

Israel holds Hamas responsible for non-combatants’ deaths and injuries because the militants in Gaza operate from within civilian areas. The Israeli government believes around 100 hostages being held in Gaza are still alive.

In the early stages of the war, Israel severely limited the entry of food, fuel and medical supplies into Gaza. Al-Aqsa Martyrs has also been short on anesthetics, meaning surgeries and other procedures are frequently performed without painkillers.

Haj-Hassan says there is only one way to end Gaza’s health care crisis.

“They need the war to stop,” she said.

 Mar 27 Roughly a dozen of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are only partially functioning. “What does that tell you about every other hospital in the Gaza Strip?”

A different team of international doctors working at Al-Aqsa Martyrs in January stayed at a nearby guesthouse."

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) affirms the rights of people with disabilities to equality and non-discrimination; freedom from violence and abuse; and to the highest attainable standard of health, among other rights.[\[274\]](#_ftn274)
 Article 11 calls for states to take “all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk,” including armed conflicts, in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law.[\[275\]](#_ftn275)

Recommendations
===============

To the Government of Israel
---------------------------

### Protection and Safety of Children with Disabilities

*   Refrain from using explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas, the use of which raises serious concerns that attacks are likely to indiscriminately harm civilians, including children, and civilian objects in violation of international humanitarian law.
    
*   Take all necessary measures for the protection and safety of children with disabilities in Gaza as obligated by international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
    
*   Specifically consider the protection and safety of children with disabilities in military operations in accordance with international humanitarian law, including by raising awareness and sensitization at all levels of the military on the particular risks and harms to people with disabilities and their needs during military operations.
    
*   Provide effective advance warning of attacks, unless circumstances do not permit, in accessible and inclusive manners and formats, to allow people with disabilities sufficient time to evacuate.
    
*   Do not unlawfully displace civilians in violation of international humanitarian law. Would you like to read this page in another language?

Summary
=======

> From the day the war broke out, they destroyed what was inside us. Specifically with respect to people with disabilities, including children, in Gaza, Israel should refrain from using explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas; end the blockade and restrictions on humanitarian aid to Gaza and ensure the provision of adequate humanitarian aid in and throughout Gaza; cease unlawful attacks on hospitals, humanitarian convoys and staff; and adopt measures with respect to effective advance warnings of attacks and evacuation orders that take into effect the impact on people with disabilities.

Countries supporting Israel, notably the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and European Union member countries, should condemn laws-of-war violations by all parties. Agence France-Presse said it assessed that 815 civilians were killed during and after the attack, including 36 children—at least two of whom had a disability—and the taking of 251 hostages, including 40 children.[\[12\]](#_ftn12)
 Human Rights Watch concluded that during the attack, Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and crimes against humanity of murder and unlawful imprisonment.[\[13\]](#_ftn13)
 Israeli forces responded with almost a year-long military assault on Gaza that has resulted in the killing of more than 41,000 Palestinians as of mid-September 2024, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, including more than 16,750 children, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reported.[\[14\]](#_ftn14)

Thousands more children are reported missing and may be trapped under the rubble of destroyed buildings.[\[15\]](#_ftn15)
 More than 95,500 people have reportedly been injured, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.[\[16\]](#_ftn16)
 The Palestinian NGOs Network (PNGO) reported on June 29 that about 10,000 people, half of them children, are estimated to have acquired a disability since October 2023.[\[17\]](#_ftn17)
 The World Health Organization estimates that more than 22,500 people of those injured as of July 23, 2024, have sustained “life-changing injuries,” requiring rehabilitation services “now and for years to come”.[\[18\]](#_ftn18)
 Save the Children reported in January that more than 10 children were losing one or both legs per day.[\[19\]](#_ftn19)
  

Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli authorities cut off essential services, including water and electricity, to Gaza and blocked the entry of all but a trickle of fuel and critical humanitarian aid, acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes.[\[20\]](#_ftn20)
 Israeli authorities have also been using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza, which constitutes a war crime.[\[21\]](#_ftn21)

Israeli forces continue to conduct numerous airstrikes and large-scale ground operations in the hostilities in Gaza with Palestinian armed groups. The secretary-general noted reported but unverified grave violations against 3,900 Israeli children and 19,887 Palestinian children during 2023.

Guterres said, “I am appalled by the dramatic increase and unprecedented scale and intensity of grave violations against children in the Gaza Strip, Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite my repeated calls for parties to implement measures to end grave violations.” He “urge\[d\] all parties to the conflict to immediately end and prevent grave violations against children … and to adopt immediately clear, time-bound commitments to end and prevent grave violations against children, as proposed by the United Nations, and to comply with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.”[\[33\]](#_ftn33)

Save the Children reported in June that up to 21,000 children were estimated to be missing, including many dead under rubble, detained, buried in unmarked graves, or separated from their families.[\[34\]](#_ftn34)
 The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reported in mid-September the “outrageously high number of children in Gaza who continue to be killed, maimed, injured, missing, displaced, orphaned and subjected to famine, malnutrition and disease,“ citing Israel‘s “attacks on Gaza using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas and its denial of humanitarian access,“ which has displaced at least 1 million children and pushed 3,500 children to risk death from malnutrition.[\[35\]](#_ftn35)

While the Israeli government has repeatedly stated that its war aims are to destroy Hamas and to free the hostages taken during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, several statements by Israeli officials, indicate an intent to inflict harm on the civilian population, including children. Airwars and other sources suggest that suspected Israeli artillery struck Anas Ibn Malik mosque, with at least four children wounded in the nearby shelter school.[\[75\]](#_ftn75)

Layan was among the few injured Palestinians allowed to leave Gaza for treatment, albeit a week after her injury. Children who have acquired a disability due to sustained injuries need proper nutrition so their bones can heal, clean water so their wounds don’t get infected, monitoring as they grow.[\[142\]](#_ftn142)

She raised concerns that due to lack of access to adequate treatment, including reconstructive surgeries and rehabilitation, children who have been injured and acquired a disability at a young age will be susceptible to developing further disabilities as they grow.[\[143\]](#_ftn143)
  

According to Humanity & Inclusion, significant damage has been inflicted upon critical rehabilitation and mental health and psychosocial support services and infrastructure, including to the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, the first facility specialized in installing prosthetic limbs and providing rehabilitation in Gaza.[\[144\]](#_ftn144)
 Humanity & Inclusion also noted that health care and rehabilitation services had already “experienced damage and destruction in previous wars and continue to be under operational and structural duress due to the closure imposed by Israeli authorities since 2007.”[\[145\]](#_ftn145)
 Human Rights Watch documented in 2020 that children in Gaza who lost limbs had difficulty getting and replacing prosthetic and assistive devices due to the Israeli government’s closure of Gaza.[\[146\]](#_ftn146)
 As of January, according to Dr. On April 4, she developed fourth-degree bedsores—the most severe type of pressure ulcer and can be life-threatening—due to lack of access to physiotherapy and prosthetic.[\[172\]](#_ftn172)
 Heals Palestine, a non-profit organization, evacuated Layan to the USA for treatment in July 2024.

Since May 7, when Israeli forces closed the Rafah crossings as part of its military operations against Rafah, Palestinians faced further difficulties to be evacuated for medical care, leaving tens of thousands of Palestinians in need of urgent medical care unable to receive treatment in Gaza or abroad.[\[173\]](#_ftn173)

  
 

Unique Risks for Children with Disabilities during Attacks, Evacuations, and Forcible Transfers
===============================================================================================

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of August 7, 1.9 million people were internally displaced, amounting to 90 percent of Gaza’s population.[\[174\]](#_ftn174)
 Civilians typically flee their homes during armed conflict to avoid fighting or reach safer areas, on the orders of a party to the conflict to evacuate for lawful security or military reasons, or because a party to the conflict unlawfully forcibly transfers them.[\[175\]](#_ftn175)
 Human Rights Watch previously documented the severe difficulties civilians with disabilities face when fleeing buildings that Israeli forces attacked during fighting between 2009 and 2014, as well as their need for help to reach safety.[\[176\]](#_ftn176)

Under the Fourth Geneva Convention applicable to occupied territory, a party to the conflict may not forcibly transfer the civilian population in whole or in part, unless required by the security of the civilians affected or for imperative military reasons.[\[177\]](#_ftn177)
 

Evacuations and the war crime of forced displacement disproportionately affect people with disabilities.[\[178\]](#_ftn178)
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, when international humanitarian law permits such evacuations, “all possible measures must be taken in order that the civilians concerned are received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and that members of the same family are not separated.” [\[179\]](#_ftn179)
 In this regard, the specific needs of persons with disabilities must be taken into account when evaluating what is satisfactory from their perspective.”

The CRPD requires governments to take “all necessary measures” to ensure the safety and protection of people with disabilities, such as by providing necessary transportation and accommodation. In the following cases, in which families of children with disabilities described strikes on their homes or neighborhoods, they said there were no warnings prior to the attacks.

### Ghazal, 14

Hala Al-Ghoula, mother of Ghazal, a 14-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, said that an Israeli airstrike struck their home in Al-Shujaiya neighborhood, Gaza City, and destroyed nearly all of the family’s possessions, including Ghazal’s orthotic shoe, wheelchair, and another device she used at night. He is very tired and cannot take care of the kids.[\[201\]](#_ftn201)

Leila also described the impact on Malek, “He acts strong in front of me, but I do see his pain and how much he misses his siblings.”[\[202\]](#_ftn202)

As of September, Leila was still in the UAE and had not been reunited with her children or husband.

Impact of Israeli Government Blockade on Children with Disabilities
===================================================================

After October 7, the Israeli government cut off essential services, including water and electricity, to Gaza and blocked the entry and distribution of humanitarian assistance, including food, water, and medicine, to the civilian population.

The Fourth Geneva Convention provides that the occupying power has the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies to the population.[\[203\]](#_ftn203)
 Warring parties must allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1247453317/gaza-baby-girl-mother-killed-israel-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/26/1247453317/gaza-baby-girl-mother-killed-israel-airstrike)) discusses a baby girl in Gaza who died after an Israeli airstrike, including images of the baby in an incubator <image:4778>

## Elaboration
The reverse image search confirms the existence of the image. The web search reveals an NPR article about a baby girl in Gaza who died after an Israeli airstrike. However, the article does not contain the image in the claim.

The claim states that the image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024, holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. The evidence does not confirm the details of the claim. More information is needed to verify the claim.
