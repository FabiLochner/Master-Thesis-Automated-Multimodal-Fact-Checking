## Actions
```
image_search("Myanmar earthquake ruins")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results discuss an earthquake in Myanmar. One source from [artnews.com](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/monumental-ruins-emerge-following-massive-myanmar-earthquake-1234738471/) contains an image of ruins ![image 2911](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168741-384034.jpg). Another source from [Archaeology.org](https://archaeology.org/news/2025/04/15/earthquake-in-myanmar-exposes-ancient-royal-structure/) discusses an earthquake in Myanmar that exposed an ancient royal structure ![image 2912](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168742-585510.jpg).

National Geographic also shows an image of ruins in Myanmar ![image 2913](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168744-381480.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an earthquake occurred in Myanmar. However, the provided images from the search results do not match the image in the claim. The search results show images of different ruins, including an ancient royal structure and other damaged buildings.

The claim states the image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake. The evidence does not provide information about the magnitude of the earthquake or the date.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim based on the provided evidence. I need more information to confirm the image's origin and the earthquake's details.

## Elaboration

The image from Britannica.com ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025)) shows ruins, but it does not match the image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is not verifiable based on the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, which caused significant damage. However, the images of the ruins provided in the search results do not match the image in the claim.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as the image in the claim is not found in the search results. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by sources like [Britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025), the image provided in the claim does not match the images of the ruins found in the search results.
