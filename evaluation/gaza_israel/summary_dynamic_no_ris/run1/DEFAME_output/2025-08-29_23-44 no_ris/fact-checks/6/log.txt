The claim '<image:7> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Benjamin Netanyahu has been hospitalized and has been seen wearing masks, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the image, the specific date (November 2024), the location (Tel Aviv), or the reason for hospitalization as stated in the claim. The search results from sources like The Guardian, CNN, and Politico do not provide any information about the image or the circumstances described in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
