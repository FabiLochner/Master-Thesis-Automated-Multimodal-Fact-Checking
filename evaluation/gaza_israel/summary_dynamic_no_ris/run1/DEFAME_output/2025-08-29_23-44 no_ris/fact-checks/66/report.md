### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The video was taken before February 2025 and the shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza. Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania in September 2024, where he signed shells. (![image 40](media/66.jpg))

The Fox News article mentions that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also signed the missile. (![image 8824](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512634-200270.jpg), ![image 8841](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512644-701300.jpg), ![image 8847](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512649-989011.jpg))
