The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the aftermath of the Hezbollah attack on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While the attack did occur, as confirmed by sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah-deepest-rocket-attacks-since-start-gaza-war), the image in the claim does not appear in any of the provided sources, including those detailing the attack's aftermath.

So, the overall veracity is: false
