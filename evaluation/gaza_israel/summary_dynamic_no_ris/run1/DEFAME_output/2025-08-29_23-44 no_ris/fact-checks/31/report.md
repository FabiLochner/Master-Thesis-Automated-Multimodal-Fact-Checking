## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags is AI-generated and fake, according to fact-check articles. The image was first posted by a satirical social media account and there is no proof of the supposed vigil. The image was shared with the caption "BREAKING: Bono and Geldof stage two-man vigil outside Israeli Embassy in Dublin." Bono condemned the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.
