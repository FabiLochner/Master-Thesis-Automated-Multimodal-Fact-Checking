Content: The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted by several countries and institutions. The definition includes examples of what might constitute antisemitism, including claims of Jewish dual loyalty and claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. The examples relating to Israel have been criticized by academics who say that they are often used to weaponize antisemitism in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. The UK, Israel, and Albania were among the first to adopt the definition. The article does not mention the World Jewish Congress or the assassination of JFK. <image:k> shows a map of IHRA members.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/focus-areas/combating-anti-semitism): 
Content: The World Jewish Congress (WJC) website discusses combating antisemitism and related conspiracy myths. It also mentions the rise of antisemitism and violent attacks. The website includes articles and news from 2025, such as "WJC Expresses Support For Katharina von Schnurbein, European Commission Coordinator On Combating Antisemitism and Fostering Jewish Life" (August 25, 2025) and "World Jewish Congress Alarmed By Franceâ€™s Unilateral Recognition of a Palestinian State" (July 24, 2025). <image:8557>, <image:8562>, <image:8563>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://combatantisemitism.org/studies-reports/congresswoman-luna-and-the-jfk-files-how-antisemitic-conspiracy-theorists-hijack-history-to-spread-hate/): 
Content: The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study on March 6, 2025, discussing how antisemitic conspiracy theorists use online platforms to spread hate, specifically in relation to the assassination of JFK. The study mentions that Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced she would lead a task force to declassify files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The article also includes examples of antisemitic posts and conspiracy theories. <image:8599>

The claim 'The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'.' is false.
Justification: The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has not amended the IHRA working definition of antisemitism to include the assassination of JFK. While the WJC provides the IHRA definition, there is no evidence of an amendment in March 2025. A study by the Combat Antisemitism Movement ([https://combatantisemitism.org/studies-reports/congresswoman-luna-and-the-jfk-files-how-antisemitic-conspiracy-theorists-hijack-history-to-spread-hate/](https://combatantisemitism.org/studies-reports/congresswoman-luna-and-the-jfk-files-how-antisemitic-conspiracy-theorists-hijack-history-to-spread-hate/)) discusses antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the JFK assassination, but this does not confirm the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
