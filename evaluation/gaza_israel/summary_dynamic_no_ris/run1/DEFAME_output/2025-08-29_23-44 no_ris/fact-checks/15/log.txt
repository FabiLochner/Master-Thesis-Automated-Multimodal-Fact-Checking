Content: The CBC News article, published on November 25, 2024, discusses an anti-NATO protest in Montreal where protesters demonstrated against the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

The protest was organized by the Divest for Palestine collective and anti-capitalist group CLAC. <image:1>

Useful result: From [Source](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/four-arrested-after-protesters-attacked-concordia-threw-molotov-cocktails-at-police): 
Content: The Montreal Gazette reports on a pro-Palestinian protest in Montreal on September 30, 2024, where demonstrators vandalized Concordia University and luxury stores. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the vandalism. <image:13>

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" in July 2024, which is supported by evidence from multiple sources, including a CBC News article ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809)). However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false, as the city considered the signs vandalism and the mayor condemned the actions.

So, the overall veracity is: false
