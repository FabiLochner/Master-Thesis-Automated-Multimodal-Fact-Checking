The claim 'As the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalate in October, 2024, the U.S. government is offering Americans loans to pay for flights out of Lebanon while they have been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year 'on US taxpayers' dime.' is false.
Justification: The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to U.S. citizens in Lebanon amid the escalating conflict, as reported by The Texas Standard ([https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel)). The U.S. State Department arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel starting October 13, 2023, with passengers expected to repay the U.S., as reported by ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/)).
