## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by Al Jazeera on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump is planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and is expected to sign an executive order (<image:0>). NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA; the article was updated on February 4, 2025, and originally published on February 3, 2025 (![image 3720](media/2025-08-23_00-35-1755909301-490503.jpg)).

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP published an article on February 5, 2025, discussing a Trump Executive Order that orders the reevaluation of the United Statesâ€™ commitment to UNRWA (![image 3709](media/2025-08-23_00-34-1755909288-981428.jpg)). The document also directs government agencies not to use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. An NPR article states that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA, and the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP article confirms that the executive order directs government agencies not to use funds for contributions to UNRWA.

However, the evidence does not specify the exact date the executive order was signed. The claim states that the order was signed on January 20, 2025, but the provided evidence does not confirm this date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of information regarding the exact date of the executive order.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The KFF article ([https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/)) mentions that on January 20, 2025, Trump issued an executive order rescinding previous orders. However, it does not mention an executive order regarding UNRWA funding.

The United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) published a summary of Executive Orders released by the White House on January 20, 2025 (![image 8360](media/2025-08-29_23-51-1756511468-812369.jpg)), which covers several Executive Orders but does not include one related to UNRWA funding ([https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/](https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. However, the additional search results do not mention an executive order regarding UNRWA funding on January 20, 2025.

Therefore, the claim that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The initial search revealed that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding, but the exact date was not specified. Subsequent searches specifically looking for an executive order on January 20, 2025, did not yield any results confirming the claim.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as there is no confirmation of an executive order on the specified date. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA is not supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of an executive order related to UNRWA funding, the specific date of January 20, 2025, is not confirmed by the search results.
