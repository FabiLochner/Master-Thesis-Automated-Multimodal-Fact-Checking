Useful result: From [Source](https://electronicintifada.net/content/palestine-pictures-april-2025/50636): 
Content: The Electronic Intifada published an article on April 2025, which includes several images of the situation in Gaza during April 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://cedmohub.eu/image-of-child-trapped-under-rubble-predates-gaza-war-and-shows-signs-of-ai/): 
Content: The AFP fact-check, published on November 29, 2023, debunks an image of a child trapped under rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation. The image was shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the Gaza war. The image was likely generated with AI tools. <image:8856>, <image:8860>, <image:8857>, <image:8858>.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While there is evidence of children being found in the rubble in Gaza, and the image's geolocation points to Palestine, the specific details of the claim, including the date and cause of death, are not verified. Additionally, a fact-check indicates that some images of children in rubble are AI-generated or predate the conflict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
