Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages): 
Content: Euronews published an article on September 5, 2024, about a protest in Tel Aviv where protesters carried makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The protesters were angry with the Israeli government. The article mentions the recovery of the body of Carmel Gat, a hostage. <image:49>

The claim '<image:49> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image shows mock coffins used in protests in Israel in September 2024, as confirmed by sources like the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-of-blood-protesters-stage-mock-funeral-for-slain-hostages-demand-deal/) and [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages). These coffins represented hostages killed in Gaza, not necessarily dead Israeli soldiers.

So, the overall veracity is: false
