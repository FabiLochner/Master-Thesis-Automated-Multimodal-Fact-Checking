Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion): 
Content: Fox News reports that President Biden was seen leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Rashid Khalidi. <image:6255>, <image:6264>, <image:6259>. The article mentions that the book describes Israel as a colonial power. The article was published on November 24, 2023.

The claim '<image:28> This image authentically shows U.S. President Joe Boden in late November 2024 exiting a Nantucket bookstore holding a copy of writer Rashid Khalidi's book, 'The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017.'' is false.
Justification: The image accurately depicts President Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine." However, the event occurred in late November 2023, as reported by sources like [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion), not in late November 2024 as the claim states.

So, the overall veracity is: false
