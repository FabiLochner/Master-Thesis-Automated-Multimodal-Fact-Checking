Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218): 
Content: The article, published on June 26, 2025, by Anadolu Agency, discusses the financial impact of a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran. It mentions that the US became directly involved on June 22 with strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, involving 125 US military aircraft. The article estimates that the total cost of the US operation could range from $1 billion to $2 billion. It also states that Israel's military expenditure has soared, with the cost of operating missile defense systems costing up to $285 million per day. <image:k>

The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While the US provides significant financial aid to Israel, as evidenced by an Al Jazeera article, and has been involved in military actions, there is no evidence to support the assertion that an assassination plot was orchestrated by Jewish Americans or that Israel wants American servicemen to fight its wars.

So, the overall veracity is: false
