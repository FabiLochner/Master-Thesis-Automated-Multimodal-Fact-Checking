TRT World published an article on June 25, 2025, discussing the economic impact of a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June 2025, which cost the US, Israel, and Iran. The article also mentions that Israel's government imposed a travel ban on Jewish citizens. ![image 8651](media/2025-08-30_00-01-1756512071-984918.jpg), ![image 8653](media/2025-08-30_00-01-1756512074-804605.jpg) An article published on June 26, 2025, by Anadolu Agency, discusses the financial impact of a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, mentioning direct US involvement with strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, involving 125 US military aircraft, with an estimated cost of $1 billion to $2 billion. It also states that Israel's military expenditure has soared, with the cost of operating missile defense systems costing up to $285 million per day. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The evidence mentions assassination attempts on Donald Trump, but it does not provide information about the perpetrators' identities or motivations.

The evidence does support the claim that the US provides significant financial aid to Israel. The Al Jazeera article states that the US has provided at least $251.2 billion in aid to Israel since 1959 and committed to giving Israel $3.8 billion per year since 2016. The evidence also indicates direct US military involvement in strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel wants American servicemen to fight its wars.


## Final Judgement
The evidence does not support the claim that the assassination plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The evidence does support the claim that the US provides significant financial aid to Israel. The evidence also indicates direct US military involvement in strikes against Iranian nuclear sites. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel wants American servicemen to fight its wars.

The claim is partially false. While the evidence confirms the US provides financial aid to Israel and has been involved in military actions, it does not support the claim about the assassination plot or the assertion that Israel wants American servicemen to fight its wars. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially false. While the US provides significant financial aid to Israel, as evidenced by an Al Jazeera article, and has been involved in military actions, there is no evidence to support the assertion that an assassination plot was orchestrated by Jewish Americans or that Israel wants American servicemen to fight its wars.
