(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:1606>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep.

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

CNN  — 

Former President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.

The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has the details.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/video-blanche-maxwell-split-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

Harris, Trump condemn pro-Hamas protest near US Capitol

Print

The two leading U.S. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024.

In her statement, Harris concluded, "I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation."

In the first days of her presidential campaign against Republican Trump, Harris held a campaign rally with a teachers' union in the southwestern state of Texas on Thursday before flying to Washington to meet with Netanyahu at the White House. You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president."

After Wednesday's protests, Trump called for Israel to quickly end the war and said the country was "not good" at promoting its cause in world affairs.

"You got to get it done quickly," Trump told Fox News.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on Thursday condemned the most visible of the pro-Hamas protests against Israel that erupted the day before near the U.S. flag.

On his Truth Social media platform, Trump said "If those people rioting in Washington yesterday were Republicans/Conservatives, they'd all be in jail right now, facing 10- to 20-year sentences. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024. Capitol.

The protests came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was defiantly defending his country's war against the Hamas militants in an address to Congress.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, said in a statement, "We saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric" at Union Station, Washington's train depot not far from the Capitol.

In the plaza in front of the rail station, demonstrators replaced American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of a fountain and used red spray paint to write "Hamas is comin'" in big letters. officials, condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.

But as the months of fighting have raged on, and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza targeting Hamas fighters killed more Palestinian civilians, especially thousands of women and children, Harris became more outspoken, initially blunter than Biden, about the need to end the conflict.

In March, she called for an "immediate" pause in fighting, contending that Israel had not done enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" among Palestinians in Gaza.

"People in Gaza are starving," she said. That's who Kamala Harris is."

Trump, after remaining mostly silent about the Israel-Hamas war, in March told Israel it has "to finish the problem."

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Additionally, [news](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-declares-two-more-gaza-hostages-dead-2024-07-22/)

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

Two people who were shot during Saturday’s Donald Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and who are now stable were identified Sunday by state police.

Pennsylvania State Police identified David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, in a Sunday [press release](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/psp/newsroom/pennsylvania-state-police-identify-victims-shot-during-attempted.html)
.

The state police also confirmed the name of [Corey Comperatore](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim/index.html)
, 50, as the victim who was killed in the assassination attempt. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself.

President Joe Biden urged people not to make assumptions and to “let the FBI do their job” in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

Biden, who spoke from the White House on Sunday, stood with Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas.

He stressed that we “don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter,” but that we “know who he is.”

He said he had instructed the investigation, which he said is in its early stages, to be “thorough and swift” and said the “investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.”

President Joe Biden is speaking from the White House on Sunday following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

The remarks this afternoon mark the second time Biden has spoken since the Saturday rally. He later told CNN that he is not aware of Trump’s “specific schedule” for the week.

Though Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.

In the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, Schimming said he remains “very, very confident” in the security preparations around the convention.

He said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding that “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”

A law enforcement source familiar with planning for the [Republican Nation Convention](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/rnc-milwaukee-trump-full-list-speakers/index.html)
 told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting. 

However, the [perimeter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/secret-service-rnc-security-perimeter/index.html)
 is unlikely to change, the source said, noting preparations for the RNC have been underway for a year and a half. 

The source added that there have been discussions about adding additional security for high-profile GOP members as well. 

The source said events, such as dinners, may be hard to police as they are outside the perimeter associated with the RNC and do not have the same level of security.

The source noted this concern had also been discussed before Saturday’s shooting.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
web_search("Donald Trump Truth Social July 25 2024 \"I hope that America obliterates Israel\"")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false, as indicated by the Politifact fact-check. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. A Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) from October 15, 2024, fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be false.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

Gaza: Baby pulled alive from rubble after Israeli air strike on Rafah
=====================================================================

Rescuers in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza, have pulled a baby girl alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike.

People used their hands to free Mariam Abu Akel from the debris, before a rescuer ran with her to a nearby hospital.

Doctors there swabbed her cuts.

The baby had been sheltering in a house with her family when the strike took place, which killed her mother and sister, Reuters reported. Her father and young brother survived.

The air strike killed 20 people and injured 55, according to a Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson.

More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Thousands more are believed to be still under rubble of buildings destroyed by air and artillery strikes.

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and taking about 240 hostages.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old girl whose parents and brother were killed (<image:6472>). The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, which killed her mother and sister (<image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>). Democracy Now! reported on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed nine children, with emergency workers pulling charred bodies from the rubble (<image:6505>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video)) <image:8753>

The UN News provides an image of a teddy bear in the rubble. ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042](https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042)) <image:8754>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.

The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that children have been found in the rubble of homes in Gaza, which aligns with the claim's general context. However, the specific details of the claim, including the date and cause of death, are not confirmed. The geolocation analysis supports the image's association with Palestine, but it does not provide definitive proof of the claim's accuracy.

However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

Among the Palestinians killed in the West Bank during April was a man who was shot after a raid on his house in the Old City of Nablus, during which his brother was arrested, according to OCHA.

That same day, 2 April, Israeli troops [shot and killed](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin_omar_zioud)
 Omar Amer Zyoud, a 16-year-old who was reportedly among a group that threw incendiary objects at military jeeps at the entrance to Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man after he allegedly threw stones at Israeli vehicles in the Bethlehem area of the southern West Bank on 3 April and confiscated his body.

A man was killed by Israeli troops searching his house when they shot at him while he was attempting to flee in his vehicle in Jenin on 4 April.

On 6 April, Israeli forces [shot and killed](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/israel-kills-children-routinely-west-bank)
 Amer Rabee, a 14-year-old Palestinian American, at the entrance to Turmusayya, a town north of Ramallah in the central West Bank.

The Israeli military [claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-teenager-with-us-citizenship-shot-dead-by-israeli-settler-2025-04-06/)
 it had opened fire toward “terrorists” who had “hurled rocks” towards a highway.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_14_year_old_palestinian_american_boy_near_ramallah)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Amer and two other children “were picking green almonds on the agricultural land adjacent to Route 60, when Israeli soldiers started shooting at the children from a distance of about 20 meters (66 feet) away.”

“Amer was shot in the head and immediately collapsed,” the rights group added.

DCIP said that Israeli forces withheld the boy’s body, which was found to have sustained 13 bullet wounds, for around five hours. <image:8806>

On 11 April, the UN human rights office [warned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2025/04/gaza-increasing-israeli-evacuation-orders-lead-forcible-transfer)
 that “Israel appears to be inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group.”

The UN office said that “the nature and scope” of evacuation orders displacing Palestinians in Gaza “raise serious concerns that Israel intends permanently to remove the civilian population from these areas in order to create a ‘buffer zone.’”

“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute,” the UN human rights office added.

Also during the month of April, the World Food Program reported that around 700,000 Palestinians in the West Bank “needed food assistance in 2024, a nearly 100 percent increase compared with the period before October 2023,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [stated](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
.

On 19 April, the Israeli military announced that one of its officers was [killed](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-19/ty-article/israeli-officer-killed-in-gaza-combat-idf-says/00000196-4f4a-d9fb-a79f-6fca06ce0000)
 by an explosive device in northern Gaza – the army’s first fatality since it resumed its offensive on Gaza a month earlier.

Also on 23 April, 10 people were [killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrikes-kill-10-school-housing-displaced-families-hit-childrens-2025-04-23/)
 in an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced families were sheltering in Gaza City.

At least 26 people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on 23 April. The boy died after nearly 20 hours in intensive care, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine, which [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_palestinian_child_with_expanding_bullet_in_jalazone_refugee_camp_raid)
 that the boy’s severe internal injuries were likely caused by expanding bullets.

These weapons have been prohibited under international law since 1868, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish, a program director with the rights group, “due to the extreme and unnecessary suffering they cause.”

“Yet, Israeli forces use these illegal weapons against Palestinian children with no consequences from the international community,” Eqtaish added.

At least five children have been killed by expanding bullets in the West Bank since 7 October 2023, according to DCIP.

Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a child, in the West Bank [between 15 and 21 April](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
. Israel is withholding their bodies.

[According to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
 OCHA, the deadly incident “followed the announcement of the death of a Palestinian from the village in Israeli custody … three days before he was set to be released.”

Defense for Children International-Palestine [stated](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_fatally_shoot_confiscate_body_of_16_year_old_palestinian_boy)
 that Jihad Adeli was part of a group that was ambushed by troops.

On 20 April, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian near Homesh settlement in the northern West Bank after the man reportedly opened fire towards a checkpoint near the settlement, causing no casualties.

On 23 April, Israeli forces shot and killed Mahmoud al-Haija, 12, in a cemetery in al-Yamoun, a town near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

“Mahmoud, alongside other boys and young men, were allegedly throwing stones toward Israeli soldiers deployed around the cemetery while other soldiers raided a residential building nearby,” Defense for Children International-Palestine [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_12_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin)
 in an initial report.

On 25 April, Israeli soldiers hiding behind a tree shot and killed Abdulkhaleq Jabour, 16, while he was closing up the shop where he worked during a military incursion into Salem, a town east of Nablus.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_working_at_a_shop_near_nablus)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Israeli soldiers surrounded Abdulkhaleq for at least 10 minutes while two of his relatives attempted to render first aid.

Israeli forces have killed 24 Palestinian boys and girls in the West Bank since the beginning of the year, according to the children’s rights group.

In addition to the above, on 21 April, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack triggered by tear gas inhalation after he was assaulted by Israeli forces who accompanied settlers during a raid in the town of Sinjil near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

“During the incident, Israeli forces injured 17 other Palestinians, including four children, and Israeli settlers physically assaulted and injured three Palestinians,” according to OCHA.

And on 27 April, a man from a village near Nablus [fell to his death](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-285-west-bank)

Save the Children, a charity based in the UK, [said](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/about-130-children-born-daily-gaza-amid-total-siege-aid-and-goods)
 on 2 April that around 130 babies are being born daily in Gaza, where the health care system is on “the verge of collapse.”

“The survival of mothers and newborn children in Gaza is under particular threat due to the lack of food, destruction of hospitals and chronic stress,” the charity stated.

At least 287 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between 3 and 8 April alone, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-278-gaza-strip)
 the health ministry in the territory.

On 1 April, dozens of settlers broke into Duma village near Nablus in the northern West Bank and set fire to several vehicles, burned a chicken coop and sprayed graffiti on the walls of homes while raiding Israeli forces fired tear gas and live ammunition, injuring three people, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Palestinians in the West Bank are under increasing pressure from both settlers and the Israeli military.

On 6 April, Israeli forces demolished more than 33 structures, including 11 residential tents, and damaged water tanks and solar panels in Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, located in an area of the West Bank’s Jordan Valley that Israel has designated as a firing zone.

The mass demolition incident displaced 33 people, including 19 children – all of whom were previously displaced from another area of the Jordan Valley due to settler violence, according to OCHA. <image:8781>

Also on 6 April, the UN human rights office [stated](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/un-human-rights-office-opt-alarm-over-killings-and-unlawful-use-force-local-police-gaza-amidst-deteriorating-public-order-enar)
 that it was “alarmed by the breakdown of public order in Gaza, with recent allegations of killings and unnecessary or disproportionate use of force in crowd control by local police.”

The UN office added that Gaza’s governance and law enforcement structures have been dismantled and destroyed by Israel’s attacks, “contributing to a deterioration of public order that threatens the safety of Palestinians and their access to basic services and life-saving humanitarian aid.”

Also on 6 April, Hamas said it [fired rockets](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-fires-rockets-israeli-cities-2025-04-06/)
 from Gaza, with Israeli media reporting a direct strike in Ashkelon in southern Israel that lightly injured 12 people."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old girl whose parents and brother were killed (<image:6472>). The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, which killed her mother and sister (<image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>). Democracy Now! reported on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed nine children, with emergency workers pulling charred bodies from the rubble (<image:6505>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

© AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE | 2024 | Všetky práva vyhradené. An image that social media posts say shows a Palestinian child trapped under rubble, however, actually appeared online at least eight months before the Gaza war, triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas militants against Israel on October 7. May God have mercy on them,” commented another.

However, AFP found the image circulated online months before Hamas’ October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

**Image predates war**

A reverse search on [TinEye](https://perma.cc/LLV5-F8GJ)
 found the image has been shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The photo was shared by user on [X](https://perma.cc/7YHX-8864)
, formerly Twitter, on February 8 in response to a post about relief works in Syria and Turkey following a devastating [earthquake](https://perma.cc/MU4G-PSSL)
 on February 6 that killed more than 50,000 people.

A Google reverse image search found the same image had also been shared on [LinkedIn](https://perma.cc/L9XV-TPYA)
 in February 2023.

Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right):

**Author(s):** AFP Bangladesh

**Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government. Long live, Long live Palestine”, reads the Bengali-language caption.

The post circulated after Hamas militants poured into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government.

A [truce agreement](https://perma.cc/M3X2-VPC8)
 that went into effect on November 24 has brought a temporary halt to seven weeks of fighting and saw dozens of Israeli hostages freed, with over 100 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in return.

! The image also bears visual irregularities that suggest it had been AI-generated, an expert told AFP.**

The image appearing to show a child trapped under concrete blocks was posted [here](https://perma.cc/6QFW-LYRP)
 on Facebook on October 19, 2023, and has since been shared more than 4,000 times.

“Just imagine it is your baby, how would you feel then! <image:8857>

Screenshot of the false post, taken on November 7, 2023

The image was shared alongside similar claims on Facebook [here](https://perma.cc/K7F4-BU92)
 and [here](https://perma.cc/N8H2-9QG5)
.

Comments from users suggested they believed it was genuine.

One wrote: “I feel like every bloodied Palestinian child is my child. <image:8858>

Screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right)

A visual communications expert told AFP it was “highly likely” the picture was generated with AI tools.

[Dr TJ Thomson](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/t/thomson-dr-t-j)
, a senior lecturer at Australia’s RMIT University School of Media and Communications, told AFP there were anomalies in the creases in the child’s forehead and chin, as well as the fingers on the child’s left hand.

An analysis of the image showed the child appears to have too many fingers, which are also deformed.

Despite the advancements in generative AI, errors still show up in AI-generated content."

([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video)) <image:8753>

The UN News provides an image of a teddy bear in the rubble. ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042](https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042)) <image:8754>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

Israel strikes targets in southern Syria after demanding demilitarisation
=========================================================================

Military sites hit as Tel Aviv says it ‘will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon’

Israeli warplanes have carried out several airstrikes on military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria, as Israeli officials warned the country’s army not to move south of the capital city.

Israeli jets struck military sites late on Tuesday in the town of Kiswah, south of Damascus, as well as in the southern province of Deraa, local [Syrian media](https://www.syria.tv/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9)
 reported.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the strikes in southern [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 and warned that Israel “will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon”.

Katz added that “any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire”.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Shortly after a Syrian rebel offensive led by Islamist opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [toppled the Assad regime on 8 December](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrians-celebrate-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-after-five-decades-of-dynastic-rule)
, Israeli forces entered the UN buffer zone between Israel and Syria. Israeli forces have remained there ever since, despite protests by Syria’s new government and the UN, which monitors the demilitarised zone between the two countries.

[Israel’s air force also carried out hundreds of airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/israel-strikes-hundreds-of-military-targets-in-syria)
 against weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime in an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. Israeli airstrikes in Syria had mostly stopped since the new year.

Hours before the Israeli bombings on Tuesday, Syria condemned Israel’s invasion of the buffer zone and called for it to withdraw its forces from Syrian territory. However, Israel also views Syria’s new rulers with suspicion, with Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Monday calling the new rulers of Syria a “jihadist, Islamist terror group”.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>).

The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

Claim: "<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israel bombing Damascus February 2025")
geolocate(<image:41>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>).

The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

image_search("explosion near Damascus February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of explosions in Syria in February 2025 (<image:8966>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were explosions in Syria in February 2025. However, none of the images from the search results match the image in the claim. The claim's assertion about the destruction of the last remaining army depots remains unverified.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in Syria in February 2025, but the specific image in the claim could not be verified. The claim also mentions the destruction of the last remaining army depots, which is not explicitly supported by the evidence.

The claim is not fully supported by the evidence because the image cannot be verified, and the claim's assertion about the destruction of the last remaining army depots is not confirmed. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025 is not fully supported. While evidence confirms that Israel struck military targets in Syria in February 2025, the specific image in the claim could not be verified, and the claim's assertion about the destruction of the last remaining army depots is not confirmed by the provided sources, including a report from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation)).

JERUSALEM — Israel's government said a drone targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as fighting with Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Gaza-based Hamas showed no pause after the [killing of the Hamas mastermind](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

**Drone targets Netanyahu’s house while Israeli strikes in Gaza kill more than 50** **Israel said a drone targeted the prime minister’s house; there were no casualties. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

_CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting._

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, was targeted by a drone. An NPR article from October 19, 2024, states that the drone targeted his house, while a CNN article from October 23, 2024, claims that Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack and that the house was damaged. The Guardian also reported on October 19, 2024, that Netanyahu's house was hit by a drone, causing superficial damage.

The articles mention the attack occurred in October 2024. The CNN article includes an image showing damage to the exterior of the house. <image:k> The NPR article includes an image showing smoke rising from an Israeli airstrike. <image:4619> The Guardian article includes an image of the house. <image:4623>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Furthermore, multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone. While the CNN article mentions Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, it does not specify that they took the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Content: "The false posts emerged after the news channel broadcast footage that appeared to show Israeli soldiers sexually abusing Palestinian prisoners at a military base.** 

“Israel’s Channel 12 asked a question in an Israeli public opinion poll: Do you agree with the claim that a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied? <image:8979>

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

**Altered screenshot**

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)

65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. The story has been updated._

The screenshots show the image originally shared by Erakat said 47% of respondents answered "yes" to a poll asking "do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian?" Various X users later claimed the image was a doctored version of a 2022 Channel 12 poll, which asked respondents about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters."

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:8989>](https://cbsaustin.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

![FILE - Rep. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., also [condemned](https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962 "https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962")
 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

.

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the Middle East in August 2024, but it does not explicitly state that they were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks specific details about the warships' destination and mission.

NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Austin said in a statement on Friday that while the U.S. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Saturday that Tehran's retaliation will be "severe and (taken) at an appropriate time, place, and manner," Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-hamas-leader-haniyeh-was-killed-by-short-range-projectile-2024-08-03/)
.

On Thursday night, President Biden reaffirmed his commitment to support Israel in a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. is taking additional measures to support Israel, its priority is to prevent a wider war in the Middle East.

"The United States also remains intently focused on de-escalating tensions in the region and pushing for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal to bring the hostages home and end the war in Gaza," Austin said.

Israel had previously pledged to kill Hamas leaders in response to the group's Oct. It remains to be seen how the recent assassinations will affect ongoing cease-fire negations and the hostage releases.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:55>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Singapore': 0.32, 'Malta': 0.15, 'France': 0.1, 'South Korea': 0.07, 'Malaysia': 0.06, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.03, 'Croatia': 0.02, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Bermuda': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results do not provide any information about the location of the image in relation to Lebanon or Israel. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the new evidence.

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

On a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.”

Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.

The Turkish flag is seen at half-staff at the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, on August 2.

CNN

A decision by the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv to fly its flag half-staff as part of Turkey’s national day of mourning for [Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html)
 has left members of the Israeli government and public enraged. 

Foreign Minister Israel Katz summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand” after the move, saying Israel “will not accept expressions of sympathy for a murderer like Ismail Haniyeh.“

The Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for the expulsion of the ambassador, saying Turkey’s lowering of the flag as a “tribute” to Haniyeh “shows exactly what they think of us.” 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday will be a national day of mourning for Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran this week. He was [assassinated](http://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)

The [US decision to send warships and fighter squadron to the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 will mark perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting.

The region is bracing for an Iranian retaliation after the country’s supreme leader vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week. Officials said the attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones [Iran launched against Israel in April,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/middleeast/iran-drones-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html)
 but it could also be larger and more complex, coordinated with Iranian proxies in the region. 

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of the Iran-backed group’s top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. 

“Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday.

USS Abraham Lincoln sails the Pacific Ocean on August 2.

Jerome D. Johnson Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class/US Navy

The [United States is sending](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran earlier this week.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group, which is currently operating in the Gulf of Oman, according to a statement from deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.

Destroyers and cruisers capable of ballistic missile defense will also be sent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. The statement does not say which warships have been sent, but two US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took part in intercepting the barrage of strikes Iran launched against Israel in April.

Austin also ordered the deployment of a fighter squadron to the region, Singh said.

The US already has the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship in the region, which operates with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, capable of carrying out an evacuation of US citizens in Lebanon should it be ordered.

Iran has vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct “multiple force posture moves” in the Middle East ahead of a possible attack by Iran on Israel, according to the Pentagon.

Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday and “informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and future defense force posture changes that the department will take to support the defense of Israel,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.

Singh declined to detail the potential moves, saying that Austin would be directing those moves “at a later time.” But the US has a number of naval assets already in the region, including a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman and amphibious assault ships and destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.

A US official separately told CNN that the additional capabilities would likely include more air defense systems to help protect Israel and US forces from a potential Iranian attack. 

Singh noted that there “could be additional” US troops that enter the region to help bolster US forces there but declined to outline specific capabilities or units that may be deployed. 

CNN reported on Thursday the Pentagon discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region. In July, the UN warned of widespread famine across [the strip](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html)
, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians. 

Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian displaced in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, told CNN that the past nine months have been engulfed by “fear and terror.” 

“This situation has become very dangerous, as hundreds of children die every day,” the 19-year-old said on Friday."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.
