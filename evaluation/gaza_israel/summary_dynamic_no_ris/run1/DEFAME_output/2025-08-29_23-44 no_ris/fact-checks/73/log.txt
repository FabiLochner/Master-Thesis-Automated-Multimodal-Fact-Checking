Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-israeli-tanks-spotted-outside-damascus-a-fact-check-7224391): 
Content: NDTV published a fact-check on December 10, 2024, regarding an image of Israeli tanks near Damascus. The fact-check determined the claim to be false. <image:8902>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights. The article includes an image of an Israeli tank. <image:8903>

The claim '<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were reports of Israeli airstrikes in Damascus in July 2025, and an image of an Israeli tank near Damascus was published by The Times of Israel, a fact-check from December 10, 2024, specifically debunked a similar claim about Israeli tanks near Damascus, labeling it as "FALSE" ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
