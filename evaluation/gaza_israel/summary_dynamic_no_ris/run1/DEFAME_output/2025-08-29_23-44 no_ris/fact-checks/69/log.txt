Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports on Israeli military activity in Syria, including a ground incursion in the Tasil area near Nawa.

The article mentions that the Israeli military responded to fire from gunmen and destroyed a former Syrian army encampment.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php): 
Content: The Security Council Report from April 9, 2025, discusses Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, including shelling in Daraa and a ground incursion. It mentions an Israeli incursion into Tasil, a town in southern Syria, as a response to fire from gunmen. The report states that the incursion occurred overnight. <image:42>

The claim '<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While Israeli forces did enter Tasil, Syria, as confirmed by reports from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/3/israel-launches-deadly-ground-incursion-amid-airstrikes-on-syria)) and the Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)), the incursion occurred in April 2025, not February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
