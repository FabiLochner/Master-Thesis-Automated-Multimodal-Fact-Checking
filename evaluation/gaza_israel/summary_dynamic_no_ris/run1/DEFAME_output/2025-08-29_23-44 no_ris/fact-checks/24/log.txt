Content: The NBC News article discusses Israel's ban on UNRWA in Palestinian territories. <image:8422>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The black ribbon on UNRWA's X profile picture was added before the death of Yahya Sinwar, as reported by DW ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)).
