While The Guardian published an article about Gaza ([https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit)) and the BBC reported on Bradford's City of Culture status ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo)), neither article contains the headline stated in the claim.
