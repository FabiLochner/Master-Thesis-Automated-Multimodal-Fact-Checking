Useful result: From [Source](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza): 
Content: The search result from CBS Austin states that the image in the claim is a doctored version of a 2022 Channel 12 poll. The original poll asked respondents about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters." The article mentions that Rep. Rashida Tlaib shared the doctored image. The article was published on August 9th, 2024. <image:8989>

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, was about the government's reliance on supporters of terrorism. The altered image, which falsely presented a question about soldiers and rape, was debunked by Channel 12 on August 9, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
