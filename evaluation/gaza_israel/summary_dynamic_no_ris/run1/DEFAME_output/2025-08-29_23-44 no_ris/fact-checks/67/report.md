## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 ![image 8782](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512617-679263.jpg), and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 ![image 8800](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512626-247840.jpg). It also mentions a meeting between Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 ![image 8785](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512619-013750.jpg), and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 ![image 8800](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512626-247840.jpg).

Another article from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) also mentions the meeting between Erdogan and al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 ![image 8834](media/2025-08-30_00-10-1756512637-713295.jpg), and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. An article from mondediplo.com ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The JINSA report from April 23, 2025, states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated."

The report also mentions that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over. ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf))

The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2025, reports that Turkey closed its airspace to Israel and severed economic and trade ties due to the war in Gaza. ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) The Haaretz article, published on July 3, 2025, discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations. ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Erdogan made statements against Israel in March 2025. Specifically, on March 30, 2025, he called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

The evidence does mention that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). Also, the Haaretz article discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)).

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in 2025. The Armenian Weekly article mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 <image:k>. The article from futureuae.com mentions an agreement reached on March 10, 2025, between Syrian President al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, which undermined Israel's attempts to manipulate the Kurdish issue, and a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu on April 7, where Trump asserted his ability to resolve any disagreement with Erdogan over Syria ![image 8878](media/2025-08-30_00-12-1756512736-977743.jpg). The madamasr.com article does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm that there were events involving Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025, there is no mention of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence does not support the claim. While there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025, the search results do not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel. Specifically, a JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) indicates that Erdogan made statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but not that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.
