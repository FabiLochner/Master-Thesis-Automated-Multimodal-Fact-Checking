Useful result: From [Source](https://scgrower.com/2025/05/15/may-grower-spotlight-gurosik-berry-plantation/): 
Content: The search result from scgrower.com shows an image of a child picking strawberries in a field. <image:8532>

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulted in the death of children, the image provided does not depict a victim of the attack. The image search results show children in strawberry fields, and there is no evidence to connect the image to the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
