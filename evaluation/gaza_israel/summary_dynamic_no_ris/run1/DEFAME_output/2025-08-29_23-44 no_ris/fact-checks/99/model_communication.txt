**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog. 

### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/israeli-military-dog-attacked-me-while-asleep-and-viciously-bit-my-shoulder/#respond)

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

[We use cookies in a limited and restricted manner for specific purposes. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

"Northern Gaza is experiencing a severe shortage of food and vegetables."

[Israel's genocide in Gaza](/topics/israel-genocide-gaza)

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers.

Since the start of the Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in late October 2023, the release of combat dog attacks on civilians has become common, with the Israeli military systematically deploying them to search buildings using cameras. It dragged me down the corridor, and I could feel pieces of my flesh falling as it bit into me."

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."
