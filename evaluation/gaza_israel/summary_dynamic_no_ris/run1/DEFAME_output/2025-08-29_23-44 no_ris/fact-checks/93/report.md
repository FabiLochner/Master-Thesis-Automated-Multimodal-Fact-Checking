### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)) reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, which killed one man and wounded four others. ![image 2525](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009980-789318.jpg)

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel)) and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html)) also report on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. ![image 2533](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009985-059149.jpg), ![image 60](media/93.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image was taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. The web search confirms that a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The same image is included in the search results, which suggests that the image depicts the aftermath of the attack.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows people at an airport in Israel after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the people are fleeing the airport.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the "fleeing" aspect is not directly supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely taken in Israel, and the web search confirms a Houthi attack in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The same image appears in the search results, suggesting it depicts the aftermath of the attack. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the people are fleeing the airport.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image was taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/) and other news outlets. The image is likely related to the aftermath of the attack, but the claim that people are fleeing the airport is not explicitly supported by the evidence.
