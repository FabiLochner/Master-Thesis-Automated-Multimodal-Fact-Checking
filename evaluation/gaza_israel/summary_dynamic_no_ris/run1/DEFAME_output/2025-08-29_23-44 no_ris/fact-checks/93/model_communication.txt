TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image was taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. The web search confirms that a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The same image is included in the search results, which suggests that the image depicts the aftermath of the attack.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows people at an airport in Israel after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the people are fleeing the airport.

Therefore, the claim is likely true, but the "fleeing" aspect is not directly supported by the evidence.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

![Noa Argamani, a rescued hostage, embraces her father, Yakov Argamani, after her rescue from central Gaza by Israeli forces on June 8, 2024.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/08-2024-06-08t143954z-1974139584-rc2278asyjze-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians-hostages-jpg.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. All of them need to be released immediately."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The CNN and Wikipedia articles discuss the Nuseirat refugee camp and the events of June 8, 2024, but do not mention the children in the image or the alleged incident at the Al-Jaoni UN school. The geolocation data suggests the image was not necessarily taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, while the provided articles discuss events on June 8, 2024. The articles do not mention the children.

More information is needed to verify the claim, including confirmation of the children's identities, the date of the incident, and the location.

According to the Gaza Health Ministry, at least 276 Palestinians were killed and over 698 were injured. The image <image:63> is not mentioned in the article.


## Elaboration
The CNN and Wikipedia articles discuss the Nuseirat refugee camp and the events of June 8, 2024, but do not mention the children in the image or the alleged incident at the Al-Jaoni UN school. The geolocation data suggests the image was not necessarily taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, while the provided articles discuss events on June 8, 2024. The articles do not mention the children.

More information is needed to verify the claim, including confirmation of the children's identities, the date of the incident, and the location.
