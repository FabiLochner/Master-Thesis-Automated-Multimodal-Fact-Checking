## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, was reported to have been killed in an Israeli airstrike in June 2025, according to The New York Times, citing an Iranian source. However, Qaani was later seen at a rally in Tehran on June 25, 2025, as reported by The Jerusalem Post and Anadolu Agency. A video on social media also showed Qaani participating in a public demonstration in Tehran on June 24, 2025. Qaani was also rumored to have been under suspicion for a potential intelligence leak that enabled Israel to devastate Hezbollah in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Reports indicate that Esmail Qaani was reported killed in June 2025, but he was later seen at a rally in Tehran on June 25, 2025, and in a public demonstration on June 24, 2025. There is no mention of him fleeing Iran in April 2025 or being confirmed safe in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Esmail Qaani was reported dead in June 2025, but later appeared in public. There is no information to support the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there were reports of Esmail Qaani's death in June 2025, he was later seen at a rally in Tehran on June 25, 2025, as reported by The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902)) and in a public demonstration on June 24, 2025. There is no evidence to support the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel.
