### After the Boomtown Rats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: After the Boomtown Rats")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg/250px-Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)

Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[5\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-5)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)

### Fathers' rights

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fathers' rights")\
\]

From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to [Father's Rights](/wiki/Father%27s_Rights "Father's Rights")
 campaigners; it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[130\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-130)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-Hand-131)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

The 1985 fundraising concert was famously conceived by Geldof after he was moved and angered by images of people starving to death in Ethiopia. I’d have no problem saying it to them if I met them.”

* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army."

## Actions
```
web_search("U2 Bob Geldof tour Israeli army November 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief in developing countries and that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid project. <image:k> An article from Dublin Live, published on November 3, 2024, discusses Mary Coughlan criticizing Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.

Relevant URLs: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof), [https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects.
2.  The Dublin Live article from November 2024 shows that Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.

**Insufficient information**: The claim cannot be verified because the search results do not mention a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects, and that in November 2024, Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza. However, there is no evidence of a multi-stadium tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
There is no evidence to support the claim. While Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects, and a November 2024 article from Dublin Live ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)) mentions criticism of Bono and Geldof, there is no mention of a tour to aid the Israeli army.

After passengers on a recent Air Canada flight discovered that Israel had been removed from the in-flight interactive map and relabeled as the Palestinian Territories, the Canadian flag carrier says that the change is the result of a “display issue.”

“Air Canada has been made aware of a display issue with the interactive map on the IFE systems of its B737 aircraft,” it says in response to an image posted on X of the altered flight map.

“The issue has affected other carriers using the same system and we are working with the third-party provider on a remedy,” it adds.

Last September, passengers noticed a similar change had been made to the interactive maps aboard a JetBlue flight. The airline similarly said that the map had been provided by a third party company, and decided “after a careful review” to switch to a new map vendor.

![a plane flying over a map](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jetblue-Palestinian-map-9sep24.png)

JetBlue has been forced to make changes to its inflight maps and has dumped its current vendor of the popular passenger amenity after Jewish customers noticed that the State of Israel had been obliterated by a much larger place label describing the entire country as the ‘Palestinian Territories.’

Although JetBlue doesn’t even fly anywhere near Israel, JetBlue’s inflight map still has global coverage, and at least one passenger discovered the apparent snub to Israel.

The mistake then quickly went viral and JetBlue responded by launching a review into its third-party inflight map vendor. Always keeping an ear close to the ground, Matt's industry insights, analysis and news coverage is frequently relied upon by some of the biggest names in journalism.

In the meantime, JetBlue said it would find a new map vendor to ensure that inflight maps reflected the place naming convention recommended by the US government.

“We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue,” a spokesperson for the airline told an Israeli media outlet on Sunday.

The statement from the airline continued: “After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. When he went to fly home with JetBlue, however, he discovered that JetBlue had canceled his ticket.

In the wake of the controversy, JetBlue [accelerated its ongoing uniform review](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/05/11/jetblue-bans-flight-attendants-from-wearing-free-palestine-flag-pins-after-altercation-with-jewish-passenger/)
 and quickly decided that customer-facing staff can only wear pin badges for countries or territories that the airline currently serves.

Several months after JetBlue’s pin badge review, Delta Air Lines also decided to ban staffers from wearing Palestine badges after accusations of antisemitism when a flight attendant was spotted wearing one of the badges.

It was initially reported that the flight attendant was breaking Delta’s uniform policy but it quickly transpired that the crew member wasn’t doing anything wrong.

Delta has, however, [now banned flight attendants from wearing Palestine pin badges](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/07/12/delta-air-changes-uniform-policy-in-the-wake-of-palestine-flag-pin-furore-that-has-left-airline-on-back-foot/)
 – a decision that angered the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) which is currently trying to unionize Delta’s crew members.

Last month, however, United Airlines [decided not intervene](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/08/29/united-airlines-refuses-to-back-down-in-decision-to-allow-flight-attendants-to-wear-palestine-flag-pins-despite-accusations-of-antisemitism/)
 when some passengers complained about seeing flight attendants wearing Palestine pin badges.

In a statement, the airline said its long-standing policy of allowing employees to wear flag pins that either designate a language they speak or which represent “pride in a place to which they may have a special connection” would remain in force.

That means that Palestine pin badges continue to be an option for United flight attendants to wear.

! We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows.”

In May, JetBlue said it would ban flight attendants and other customer-facing staff from wearing ‘Free Palestine’ pin badges after a Jewish customer accused the airline of antisemitism following a run-in with a crew member who was wearing the controversial pin badge.

Paul Faust, 54, was flying with JetBlue on a flight from Fort Lauderdale when he noticed a flight attendant wearing a ‘Free Palestine’ pin badge and decided to approach one of her colleagues to explain that Jewish passengers could find the badge offensive.

Faust says he thought the matter was over after expressing his opinion, but upon landing, he discovered that the airline had called the cops on him.

When Faust deboarded, the cops hadn’t yet arrived so he didn’t wait around but thought the matter was over. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. <image:5310>

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

Biden laid out a three-phase [ceasefire proposal](/world/middle-east/whats-new-israel-ceasefire-proposal-biden-announced-2024-05-31/)
 in an address on May 31. sources.

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/world/middle-east/obituary-tough-talking-haniyeh-was-seen-more-moderate-face-hamas-2024-07-31/)

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

CNN  — 

Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s [address to Congress](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html)
 on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left.

An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris’ aide cited a previously scheduled event as the reason for missing the speech Wednesday.

A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden’s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister.

The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris’ first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and [endorsed Harris’ candidacy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html)
.

Harris is expected to “continue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,” the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas’ attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” according to the aide.

U.S. “And they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.”

On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority’s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters.

“Her travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,” the aide said.

Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu’s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson.

Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu’s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN.

Netanyahu landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a [post by an Israeli Embassy official on X.](https://x.com/EliavBenjamin/status/1815484694902837408)
 He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza – including Americans – on Monday evening.

Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife, are interviewed before the departure for Washington, Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel, July 22, 2024. — Amos ben Gershom/GPO

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to arrive to Washington on Monday and meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday, a day before the Israeli leader is due to address a joint session of Congress.

After Biden announced his intention to withdraw from the presidential race and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, Netanyahu refrained from wading into US electoral politics. The Israeli prime minister who is known to favor Republican nominees said Monday he will seek the continuation of American bipartisan [support of Israel](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/biden-approaches-red-line-netanyahu-7-months-gaza-war)
 and pledged to preserve Israel’s friendship and partnership with the United States no matter who wins the next election.

Speaking with reporters before taking off for Washington, Netanyahu said he intended to reaffirm to the United States — "to our friends in both political camps" — that "regardless of who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains its most indispensable and strongest ally in the Middle East."

**Harris to the left of Biden**

Apart from Biden, and a possible, not-yet-confirmed meeting with former President Donald Trump, Netanyahu is also set to meet with Vice President and presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

Harris is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reuters said Monday that Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policies, but could adopt a harsher tone with Israel over the Gaza war, if elected president.

Sidelining his disagreements with Biden, Netanyahu said that in addition to addressing Congress July 24, he is also set to meet with the American president "whom I have known for over 40 years." Netanyahu said, "This \[the meeting\] will be an opportunity to thank him for the things he did for Israel in the war and during his long and distinguished career in public service, as senator, vice president and president. In this time of war and uncertainty, it is of the outmost importance for our enemies to know that the United States and Israel are standing together — today, tomorrow and always."

Netanyahu’s visit to Washington will be his first since establishing his government in December 2022, and in fact the first in almost four years. Still, Schumer eventually joined the initiative of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite Netanyahu to address a joint session, making the Israeli premier one of the only world leaders to deliver his fourth speech to Congress.

The invitation letter for Netanyahu — signed by Johnson, Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — said, “To build on our enduring relationship and to highlight America’s solidarity with Israel, we invite you to share the Israeli government’s vision for defending democracy, \[combating\] terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.”

Washington police said they were expecting a large number of demonstrators outside Congress on Wednesday, protesting against Netanyahu and the [Gaza war](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israels-netanyahu-gambles-gaza-cease-fire-new-conditions)
, and were making additional security arrangements. He said that this would mean that Netanyahu should expect a complicated meeting with the president, who will insist on reaching soon a plan for the liberation of the hostages and a Gaza cease-fire.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu around July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not include any direct quotes from Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

To verify the claim, I need to find a direct quote from Kamala Harris on July 22, 2024, or around that date, where she explicitly states the U.S. support for Israel will continue.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and would meet with Benjamin Netanyahu later in the week, with an expected emphasis on ensuring Israel's self-defense (<image:k>). The Washington Post reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Netanyahu addresses Congress.

Al-Monitor also reported on Netanyahu's visit to Washington, mentioning his meeting with Harris (<image:8630>, <image:8633>, <image:8634>, <image:8635>, <image:8636>).

## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu around July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not include any direct quotes from Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

To verify the claim, I need to find a direct quote from Kamala Harris on July 22, 2024, or around that date, where she explicitly states the U.S. support for Israel will continue.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on or around July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not provide a direct quote from Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

Since the evidence does not contain the specific quote attributed to Kamala Harris, the claim cannot be verified. `not enough information`

What Kamala Harris has said on Israel, Gaza war
===============================================

Vice President Kamala Harris is unlikely to significantly deviate from President Joe Biden’s line on Israel during the election campaign, but she could harshen the tone if elected president.

US Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff descend from Air Force Two at Delaware National Air Guard base in New Castle, Delaware, on July 22, 2024. "She will have to somewhat distance herself from Biden, but she is going to keep it very minimal," as Israel is not a key issue in the American presidential elections where immigration and inflation will dominate.

Considered to the left of President Joe Biden on the Gaza war and Israeli policy, Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/gaza-iran-what-kamala-harris-middle-east-policy-could-look)
 is expected to adopt a slightly more critical approach of Israel's military conduct when she likely becomes the Democratic nominee for president — and an even harsher approach if she wins the election, experts tell Al-Monitor. 

"We don’t know enough," Ziegler Distinguished Fellow at The Washington Institute David Makovsky, who served on the US negotiating team during the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian talks, told Al-Monitor. A White House readout after the meeting said Harris "raised the need to increase stability and security in the West Bank and hold extremist settlers accountable for violent acts." The Biden administration has imposed [sanctions](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/extremist-west-bank-settlers-outposts-hit-us-sanctions)
 on several individuals and entities accused of committing violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. 

**Obama redux?**

Israeli and American experts warn it is too soon to have a clear picture on the policy Harris will espouse on Israel in general and on the Gaza war in particular, as she has not yet officially received the nomination as the Democratic Party candidate. On the other hand, she has been quite outspoken about Palestinian suffering in Gaza."

In making his assessment, Makovsky drew on the speech Harris delivered in Dubai last December, when she said that Israel "must do more to protect civilian life \[in Gaza\]." Reaffirming the Biden administration's stance that Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas after the Gaza-based group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, Harris also expressed concerns about widespread Palestinian suffering and warned that "international humanitarian law must be respected."

Contrary to high-ranking members of the Biden foreign policy and defense team, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Biden himself, among others, Harris has not traveled to Israel since Oct. While Biden has had dealings with Netanyahu for four decades and touts their close relationship despite its obvious souring in recent months, Harris has met the Israeli premier only a handful of times. 

**Harris on the Gaza war**

Addressing the Munich Security Conference in February, Harris said that Hamas had used rape of Israeli women as a weapon of war, but she added that "we have also been clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, that Israel must do better to protect innocent civilians." On that occasion, Harris also called on Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table, noting that "there cannot be, in my opinion, peace and security for that region — for the people of Israel or the Palestinians and the people of Gaza — without a two-state solution."

Harris’ call to protect the lives of Gaza civilians did not markedly differ from statements made by Biden. Still, contrary to Biden, in a July 8 interview with The Nation, Harris went into greater detail on the suffering of Gazans. I’m hearing stories about their eating animal feed, grass … so that’s how I think about it," The Nation quoted Harris as saying.

Abstract
--------

The Israeli State recently announced that it may begin to use genetic tests to determine whether potential immigrants are Jewish or not. This development would demand a rethinking of Israeli law on the issue of the definition of Jewishness. In this article, we discuss the historical and legal context of secular and religious definitions of Jewishness and rights to immigration in the State of Israel. In conclusion, we raise several questions about future potential impacts of Jewish genetics on Israeli law and society.

1. This development would demand a rethinking of Israeli law on the issue of the definition of Jewishness. In this article, we discuss the historical and legal context of secular and religious definitions of Jewishness and rights to immigration in the State of Israel. In conclusion, we raise several questions about future potential impacts of Jewish genetics on Israeli law and society.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, as it is used for immigration purposes and is subject to legal restrictions.
2.  The provided sources discuss the use of genetic tests to determine Jewish identity for immigration and a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of targeting civilians, saying it abides by international law and has a right to defend itself after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Some 83% of Gaza’s population are residing in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone,” according to IDF assessments in July.

The zone is located in the al-Mawasi area on the southern Strip’s coast, western neighborhoods of Khan Younis, and central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. Israel says it has killed some 18,000 combatants in battle as of November, 2024, and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

According to the PCBS, the population of Gaza has declined by about 160,000 during the course of the war to 2.1 million, with more than a million or 47% of the total under the age of 18. The data presented by the body this week claimed that there were approximately 60,000 pregnant women currently in the Strip, which would mean an increase in births despite the overall decline in population and ongoing grueling war.

The PCBS said some 22% of Gaza’s population currently faces catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, according to the criteria of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor.

Included in that 22% are some 3,500 children at risk of death due to malnutrition and lack of food, the bureau said.

It added that Israel has “raged a brutal aggression against Gaza targeting all kinds of life there; humans, buildings and vital infrastructure… entire families were erased from the civil register. (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Around 45,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since the war began and another 11,000 are missing, the bureau said, citing numbers from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

The Hamas figures cannot be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. <image:1646>

This picture shows tents at a makeshift camp for displaced Palestinians, during a storm in Gaza City on December 31, 2024, . The numbers appear to assume that all of those considered missing amid the mass displacement inside the Strip are actually dead.

Six percent of the prewar population figure cited by PCBS would indicate a decline of approximately 126,000 people."

Etymology
---------

This section is an excerpt from [Gaza City § Etymology](/wiki/Gaza_City#Etymology "Gaza City")
.\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_City&action=edit)\
\]

The name _Gaza_ first appears in military records of [Tuthmosis III](/wiki/Tuthmosis_III "Tuthmosis III")
 of [Egypt](/wiki/New_Kingdom_(Egypt) "New Kingdom (Egypt)")
 in the 15th century BC,[\[34\]](#cite_note-38)
 and was mentioned in the [Amarna correspondence](/wiki/Amarna_correspondence "Amarna correspondence")
 as _Āl Ĥazzati_ and other variant spellings.[\[35\]](#cite_note-39)
 In [Neo-Assyrian](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian")
 sources, reflecting the late [Philistine](/wiki/Philistine "Philistine")
 period, it was known as _Hāzat_.[\[36\]](#cite_note-40)
 It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city's [modern Hebrew](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew")

 [fled or were expelled](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion_and_flight "1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight")
 to the Gaza Strip.[\[41\]](#cite_note-Reuters-45)
 By the end of the war, 25% of Mandatory Palestine's [Arab](/wiki/Arab "Arab")
 population was in Gaza, though the Strip constituted only 1% of the land.[\[42\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFiliu201471-72-46)
 The same year, the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")
 Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ([UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")

After the dissolution of the All-Palestine Government in 1959, under the excuse of pan-Arabism, Egypt continued to occupy Gaza until 1967. Thousands of homes were bulldozed and large numbers of Bedouin families were exiled to the Sinai.[\[60\]](#cite_note-64)

[\[62\]](#cite_note-66)

Between 1973 (after the [Yom Kippur War](/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War "Yom Kippur War")
) and 1987, official policy on economic development in the Gaza Strip remained the same as in 1969 with limited local investment and economic opportunity coming primarily from employment in Israel.[\[63\]](#cite_note-:7-67)

Gaza City in 1967

According to [Tom Segev](/wiki/Tom_Segev "Tom Segev")
, moving the Palestinians out of the country had been a persistent element of Zionist thinking from early times.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)
 In December 1967, during a meeting at which the [Security Cabinet](/wiki/Security_Cabinet_of_Israel "Security Cabinet of Israel")
 [brainstormed](/wiki/Brainstorming "Brainstorming")
 about what to do with the Arab population of the newly occupied territories, one of the suggestions Prime Minister [Levi Eshkol](/wiki/Levi_Eshkol "Levi Eshkol")
 proffered regarding Gaza was that the people might leave if Israel restricted their access to water supplies.[\[65\]](#cite_note-69)
 A number of measures, including financial incentives, were taken shortly afterwards to begin to encourage Gazans to emigrate elsewhere.[\[64\]](#cite_note-TSegev-68)

 Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, "various international agencies struggled to respond" and [American Near East Refugee Aid](/wiki/American_Near_East_Refugee_Aid "American Near East Refugee Aid")
 was founded to help victims of the conflict by providing immediate emergency relief.[\[67\]](#cite_note-71)

Israeli soldiers in Gaza in 1969

Subsequent to this military victory, Israel created the first [Israeli settlement](/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement")
 bloc in the Strip, [Gush Katif](/wiki/Gush_Katif "Gush Katif")
, in the southwest corner near [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
 and the Egyptian border on a spot where a [small kibbutz](/wiki/Kfar_Darom "Kfar Darom")
 had previously existed for 18 months between 1946 and 1948. The commission deemed the rest of the cases illegal, and concluded with a recommendation calling on Israel to examine whether [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
 or [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
 had been committed, and if so, to bring those responsible to trial.[\[147\]](#cite_note-151)
[\[148\]](#cite_note-152)

On 28 February 2019, the Commission said it had "'reasonable grounds' to believe Israeli soldiers may have committed war crimes and shot at journalists, health workers and children during protests in Gaza in 2018." Israel refused to take part in the inquiry and rejected the report.[\[149\]](#cite_note-CNN1111-153)

### 2021: Israel–Palestine crisis

Before the [2021 Israel–Palestine crisis](/wiki/2021_Israel%E2%80%93Palestine_crisis "2021 Israel–Palestine crisis")
, Gaza had 48% unemployment and half of the population lived in poverty."

===============================

The Gaza Strip is a Palestinian territory of about 365 square kilometers and 2.1 million inhabitants, making it one of the world’s most densely populated regions. 
  
From 2008 onwards, in response to rocket attacks from Palestinian militants, Israel began its blockade of Gaza, causing the movements of [goods](/statistics/1423093/gaza-average-monthly-volume-of-incoming-goods/)
 and [people](/statistics/1423074/gaza-number-of-monthly-average-exits-to-or-via-israel/)
 from and into the Gaza Strip to be very restricted ever since. 
  

The population of Gaza
----------------------

The Gaza Strip has quite a young population, with most inhabitants under 15 years old. While declining over the years, the [fertility rate in Gaza](/statistics/1423019/gaza-fertility-rate/)
 is still relatively high. [The life expectancy of Gazans](/statistics/1423008/gaza-life-expectancy-at-birth-by-gender/)
 was estimated at 72.97 years for men and 76.81 years for women. 
  

The Israel-Hamas war 2023
-------------------------

Before October 2023, there had been [four wars between Israel and Hamas](/statistics/1422874/palestinian-territories-duration-of-israeli-military-actions-in-the-gaza-strip/)
. [The electricity supply](/statistics/1422942/gaza-supply-of-electricity-by-provider/)
, which Israel mainly controls, was already limited throughout the day, and Israel and Egypt controlled the import of goods into Gaza. Since November 19, an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza – over 82 percent of the region’s total population – have become internally displaced refugees."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) <image:1632>

Conversely, CNN reported that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The Times of Israel also reported a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), with approximately 160,000 people fewer and around 45,500 Palestinians killed since the war began.

Statista ([https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/](https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/)) reports a total population of 2.1 million and mentions casualties and internally displaced refugees since October 7, 2023, due to the war.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is contradicted by multiple sources. The NYCFPA article supports the claim, but it is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% decline in population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). Wikipedia and Statista also mention a population decline.

Conversely, CNN reported that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving Gaza since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. The Times of Israel also reported a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), with approximately 160,000 people fewer and around 45,500 Palestinians killed since the war began. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) <image:1646>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip)) estimates the population of Gaza to be around 2,050,000 in 2025 and mentions a 6% decline in population since the start of the war <image:k>. Statista ([https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/](https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/)) reports a total population of 2.1 million and mentions casualties and internally displaced refugees since October 7, 2023, due to the war. The World Population Review ([https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza)) estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth.


## Elaboration
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is contradicted by multiple sources. The NYCFPA article supports the claim, but it is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% decline in population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). Wikipedia and Statista also mention a population decline.

But as fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has intensified – with civilian casualties mounting, especially in Beirut and southern Lebanon – teams with the U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who’d like to depart.

“Our whole goal here throughout the entire event is to get American citizens from a place of danger to a place of safety,” Kerwin said.

Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon have forced more and more people from their homes. I want to mention one other thing...

SUMMERS: Right.

BITTER: ...That we're doing in Lebanon, which we've never done before, which is we are offering loans.

SUMMERS: Rena, I think the connection's a little choppy. We are in touch with about 8,000 Americans, a little bit more, who are seeking our assistance - some to depart, but not all to depart - and I did mention these loans.

SUMMERS: Right.

BITTER: And we want American citizens to leave, but we recognize that some of them may choose to stay, and this is an opportunity for them to be able to...

SUMMERS: OK.

The U.S. government will provide charter flights to cities in Europe, White House spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. It is unclear how long the offer will last but it might just a few days, airline officials said.

A State Department email seen by Reuters said it plans to offer transit options beginning on Friday "but it will take some period of time to schedule everyone seeking to depart."

" If you choose to take this departure assistance, transportation will be by air to Athens or Frankfurt, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus," it added.

Senate Majority Chuck Schumer praised the announcement but said "these transports must be increased as needed to ensure Americans in Israel who want to can return to the United States."

Deputy Secretary of State Richard Verma held discussions with U.S. Representatives Grace Meng and Nicole Malliotakis sent a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the department "to use all tools at its disposal help get Americans out of Israel and back home to the United States."

The U.S. State Department arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe starting October 13, 2023 ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725)). Passengers were asked to repay the U.S. for the flights ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/)).

The claim that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans in Lebanon is supported by the evidence. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime." The flights were for American citizens, and passengers were expected to repay the U.S.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans in Lebanon, and chartered flights were arranged for American citizens in Israel. The flights were not for Israeli citizens, and passengers were expected to repay the U.S. for the flights. Therefore, the claim is partially false. `false`

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (<image:8744>). The search result from vpk.name shows a burning tank (<image:8745>). The source discusses an old photo that is being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank in Shamaa, south of Lebanon (<image:8746>).

The sources are:

*   [https://vpk.name/en/783167_atgm-kornet-burned-israeli-tanks-merkava-mk4-back-in-2006.html](https://vpk.name/en/783167_atgm-kornet-burned-israeli-tanks-merkava-mk4-back-in-2006.html)
*   [https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/11/25/old-photo-circulated-as-showing-destruction-of-israeli-military-tank-in-shamaa-south-of-lebanon/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/11/25/old-photo-circulated-as-showing-destruction-of-israeli-military-tank-in-shamaa-south-of-lebanon/)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, including one from Sky News. One source discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank in Shamaa, south of Lebanon. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel.

The evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024. The evidence does not provide the date or location of the image.

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, including one from Sky News. One source discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank in Shamaa, south of Lebanon. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel.

The evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024. The evidence does not provide the date or location of the image.

*   Israeli army issues new evacuation orders for Jabalia
*   Israel says it is trying to stop militants regrouping
*   Palestinian medics report casualties in latest fighting

CAIRO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Israel sent tanks deeper into Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday and advised people to leave as it pounded the historic Palestinian refugee camp from the air, residents said.

Palestinian medics said casualties had been reported in Jabalia but they were unable to reach areas under fire.

Israel's army has said its forces are trying to stop fighters from the Hamas militant group staging further attacks from Jabalia and want to prevent them regrouping.

"Jabalia is being wiped out," was repeated in many messages posted on social media by residents of Gaza, who on Monday marked the first anniversary of the [Israel-Hamas war](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
, triggered by the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals remain even partially functioning after a year of Israeli bombardments.

Smoke rises in northern Gaza, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, as seen from Israel, October 7, 2024. Hamas denies this.

The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters had attacked Israeli forces in the north with anti-tank rockets, and that there were casualties among the Israeli troops.

The Israeli military said it had killed many Palestinian militants, located weapons and dismantled military infrastructure in its operations in Jabalia.

Reuters was unable to verify the battlefield reports.

Israel began its offensive after Hamas-led militants stormed across the border into southern Israeli communities on Oct. Israel's military said one soldier had been killed in combat in northern Gaza.

Later in the day, the Israeli military said it had detected and intercepted two launches of projectiles crossing Gaza, shortly after Hamas' smaller ally Islamic Jihad said it had fired rockets towards Sderot in nearby southern Israel.

In Gaza, the Israeli army issued new evacuation orders to residents of Jabalia and nearby Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, telling them to head to a humanitarian-designated zone in Al-Mawasi in the south of the crowded coastal enclave.

The Indonesia, Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza have also been asked to evacuate in the past 48 hours, World Health Organization officials told a briefing in Cairo. officials say there are no completely safe places in Gaza.

"Jabalia is being bombed as if the war has just begun and the world is blind about it," said Salah, 60, a father of five who is a resident of Gaza City.

"We live at least seven kilometres away, but the sounds of Israeli airstrikes and tank shelling deprive us of sleep. The world must stop Israeli crimes," he said via a chat app.

Israel, which is also in [conflict with Hezbollah](/world/middle-east/hezbollah-strikes-israel-gaza-war-anniversary-fears-grow-over-middle-east-2024-10-07/)
 in Lebanon, says Hamas militants use residential areas as cover in the densely populated territory, including schools and hospitals. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's ensuing offensive in Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, the enclave's health ministry says. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced and humanitarian conditions have deteriorated sharply.

Published On 6 Oct 20246 Oct 2024

The Israeli military has carried out intense bombardment in the Jabalia refugee camp, killing at least 17 people hours after forcing residents in the area to leave again during its third ground assault on the densely populated camp in northern Gaza since launching the war a year ago.

The Palestinian Civil Defence agency said [on Sunday](/news/liveblog/2024/10/6/live-israel-carries-out-very-violent-bombing-campaign-on-beirut)
 that the death toll included nine children following air attacks and as the army deployed tanks into the area for the first time in months.

The Palestinian Civil Defence spokesperson in Gaza, Mahmoud Basal, added that Jabalia was targeted with multiple strikes overnight, resulting in many casualties. It felt like the early days of the war,” Raed, 52, from Jabalia, told the Reuters news agency before his family left for Gaza City on Sunday.

On Sunday morning, the Israeli military said its forces had “successfully” encircled the refugee camp and were operating in the area.

The army said the decision was taken after intelligence indicated the “presence of terrorists and terror infrastructure in the area of Jabalia … as well as efforts by Hamas to rebuild its operational capabilities in the area”.

Israel has destroyed hospitals, schools and residential areas, claiming Hamas was operating under them but providing no proof of its claims. This may lead to more civilian deaths and injuries,” he said.

Military and security analyst Elijah Magnier says Israel’s renewed ground invasion of northern Gaza was “inevitable” as far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Palestinian armed resistance groups had recruited “more than a thousand people”.

“Israelis have returned to Gaza several times, they’ve returned to the north several times, they’ve destroyed the infrastructure, the hospitals, everything,” Magnier told Al Jazeera.

“They will continue doing so unless \[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\] Netanyahu stops this war.”

(Al Jazeera)

Evacuation orders
-----------------

The Israeli army has called on Palestinians in northern Gaza to flee to designated “safe zones” in southern and central Gaza as it begins a renewed ground offensive. Residents in Jabalia have described the intensified attacks as some of the worst in months.

“Dozens of explosions from air strikes and tank shelling shook the ground and buildings. Rights organisations say these attacks amount to war crimes.

Meanwhile, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said its fighters have targeted “a command and control room” belonging to Israeli forces who were trying to get into Jabalia refugee camp.

‘Deteriorating’ situation
-------------------------

Reporting from near the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Jabalia, journalist Moath al-Kahlout said that the situation in the north was “deteriorating”, adding that an “entire family” had been killed in the overnight attacks.

“The Israeli army dropped leaflets on the Jabalia refugee camp ordering people to flee their homes, and this alarming development suggests that the Israeli army is preparing for further attacks. But no place in Gaza is safe for Palestinians, including the so-called “safe zones”, campaigners say.

But as some Palestinians begin making the journey southwards, Gaza’s Interior Ministry has called on residents to ignore Israel’s evacuation orders.

“Israeli claims about the presence of safe zones in southern Gaza are lies as Israel commits crimes and massacres in all areas of the enclave,” the ministry said in a statement.

“We call on citizens in northern Gaza to ignore Israeli threats.”

Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said the difference this time, compared to earlier evacuation orders, is that it is “not only blocks but whole areas”.

“Some of those Palestinians who were in the north have refused to evacuate despite the attacks and also the starvation and harsh conditions the blockade has imposed on them. They still refuse to leave,” Khoudary said.

She added that a member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) was also targeted in Sunday’s strikes and was killed.

According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, at least 41,870 Palestinians have been killed and 97,166 others injured since the war began on October 7.

The Wikipedia article mentions an ambush on October 10, 2024, where Hamas destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. Reuters and Al Jazeera also report on the fighting in Jabalia, including tank deployments.

Between 10.30am and 11.30am on 9 October last year, five Israeli airstrikes tore through the market, killing dozens of people.

They were the opening salvoes of a devastating Israeli campaign, conducted in three waves, that has left the camp an unrecognisable wasteland of rubble.

“This year is one of the worst I have experienced,” said 33-year-old Ahlam al-Tlouli, who comes from the Tal al-Zaatar area of the camp. “No house, person, tree or stone was spared.”

‘Jabaliya is like hell’
-----------------------

**The third offensive: October 2024 – ongoing**

The heavy damage inflicted on Jabaliya during the second offensive paled in comparison with the destruction levelled since 5 October, when Israeli forces returned in large numbers for a third time.

Over the course of the offensive – which targeted Jabaliya city as well as the camp – whole groupings of buildings have been demolished, replaced in some areas by bulldozed lanes to accommodate Israeli armour and tank berms. Every minute that passes feels like a year.”

Over the course of the Israeli invasion, settlements across the Gaza Strip have suffered damage.

This is the story of the ruin of Jabaliya.

‘We were starving and without food’
-----------------------------------

**The first offensive: October 2023 – January** **2024**

Jabaliya was pummelled with airstrikes in the first months of the war. The deadliest, on 31 October, [killed scores of people](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/01/jabalia-camp-airstrike-gaza)
 and left large craters in the ground at a busy junction.

Israel said the camp was a command centre for Hamas’s northern brigade and that it had identified Hamas tunnel systems under the camp. In footage posted online in recent weeks, bulldozers and backhoes can be seen pulling down structures.

“There are bodies on the roads and under the rubble,” said Mahmoud Basal, 39, a civil defence official. “Homes, streets, health and educational facilities – everything is gone.”

On 11 May the IDF reported that Hamas had managed to reconstitute its military capabilities, and it issued a new round of evacuation orders to civilians. Drone footage filmed in June laid bare the extent of the destruction.

CAIRO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Israeli military strikes killed at least 50 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces tightened their squeeze around Jabalia in the north of the enclave on Tuesday, amid fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters.

Palestinian health officials said at least 17 people were killed by Israeli fire near Al-Falouja in Jabalia, the largest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, while 10 others were killed in Bani Suhaila in eastern Khan Younis in the south when an Israeli missile struck a house.

Earlier on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike destroyed three houses in the Sabra suburb of Gaza City, and the local civil emergency service said they recovered two bodies from the site, while the search continued for 12 other people who were believed to have been in the houses at the time.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, including one from Sky News. One source discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank in Shamaa, south of Lebanon. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel.

The evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows an Israeli tank unit near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza that was successfully ambushed by Hamas fighters in October 2024. The evidence does not provide the date or location of the image.


## Actions
```
web_search("Hamas ambush Israeli tank Jabalia October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the "Siege of North Gaza" mentions fighting in Jabalia, including an ambush on October 10, 2024, where Hamas destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. The Reuters article from October 8, 2024, reports that Israeli tanks pushed into Jabalia. Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli ground offensive on Jabalia on October 6, 2024, including intense bombardment and tank deployment (<image:1>).


## Elaboration
The web search results provide additional information about the events in Jabalia in October 2024. The Wikipedia article mentions an ambush on October 10, 2024, where Hamas destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company. Reuters and Al Jazeera also report on the fighting in Jabalia, including tank deployments.

While the evidence confirms that there was fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including tank deployments and an ambush, it does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim. The evidence does not provide any information about the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli tank destroyed Jabalia October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on December 18, 2024, detailing the destruction of the Jabaliya refugee camp, including bulldozed lanes for Israeli armour and tank berms. The article mentions three offensives by Israeli forces, with the third offensive beginning on October 5, 2024. Reuters reported on October 15, 2024, that Israeli forces tightened their squeeze around Jabalia amid fierce battles with Hamas-led fighters, mentioning that the Israeli military has encircled the Jabalia camp and sent tanks into nearby towns (<image:8750>).


## Elaboration
The web search results confirm that there was fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including the deployment of tanks. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim. While the search results confirm that there was fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including tank deployments and an ambush, it does not provide any information about the image. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim cannot be verified. While web searches confirm fighting in Jabalia in October 2024, including tank deployments and an ambush, the evidence does not link the provided image to these events. The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but do not confirm the context of the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image in the claim shows a protest in solidarity with Palestine. However, the photos are from a protest held in Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 12, 2025, and not in Kolkata, India. The event was a "March for Gaza" with approximately 100,000 participants.

The articles from [Factly](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/), [Tezzfeed](https://tezzfeed.com/latest-news/palestinian-media-shares-bangladeshs-pro-gaza-protest-photos-mistakenly-labels-them-as-kolkata-1744522142539), and [Kashif](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/images-of-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-palestine-from-bangladesh-circulate-as-from-india/) all confirm that the images were mislabeled. <image:5422>, <image:5425>, <image:5433>, <image:5436>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The images show a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The protest, which took place on April 12, 2025, was a "March for Gaza" with approximately 100,000 participants.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The images are from a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The evidence from multiple sources confirms the misidentification of the location. `false`

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza
============================================================

### The video actually shows him at a U.S. Available at: [Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children](https://x.com/Abdella07967637/status/1896372053160366410)
 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 \[Accessed 13 Mar."

#### [Ukrainian President Zelenskyy: 'It is so difficult to lose people... Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza."

## Actions
```
web_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing bombs")
image_search("Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing bombs")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The video was taken before February 2025 and the shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza. Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania in September 2024, where he signed shells. (<image:40>)

The Fox News article mentions that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also signed the missile. (<image:8824>, <image:8841>, <image:8847>)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y30244467o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y30244467o)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09)) both show images of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. <image:8879> <image:8880>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza. The event took place in September 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells in the U.S., not Israeli bombs. The shells were for Ukraine, not Gaza, and the event occurred in September 2024, not March 2025. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in September 2024, not Israeli bombs as claimed. The shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not in Gaza.

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

Israel operates a range of defensive systems to block attacks by everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.

The country’s **Iron Dome system** has been in the headlines often since regional hostilities ramped up last year in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s largest ever attack on the country, fueling fears of a further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.

Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what Tehran said was a response to the [killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/middleeast/hezbollah-nasrallah-killed-israel-strikes-intl/index.html)

 against the Iran-backed group in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. We will act at the time and place we decide,” he said.

CNN teams in Beirut heard blasts overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.

Thick plumes of smoke were visible in the sky above the capital’s southern suburbs, a CNN photo shows.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said it is striking Hezbollah targets in several southern suburbs of Beirut and more details of the operation would follow.

It also told residents to evacuate several neighborhoods and buildings in the southern suburbs, where it suggested strikes are planned.

In one of a few messages posted to X after midnight local time, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that residents are located near “dangerous facilities belonging to Hezbollah against which the Defense Force will act with strength shortly.”

Evacuation orders from the Israeli military have been posted on social media between midnight local time and 3 a.m., likely when many people are sleeping.

An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced over the past couple of weeks, thousands of them sheltering in Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the southern suburbs of the city.

Israeli authorities were picking through pieces of shrapnel to identify the type of missile used in the aftermath of an attack carried out by Iran on Tuesday.

CNN’s Jeremy Diamond, reporting from the site of an attack near a school in the central Israeli town of Gedera, said the impact of the strike left a wall and the windows of a second-grade classroom shattered, with significant damage seen inside.

Workers and heavy machinery could be seen in the background clearing through debris around a large crater measuring around 8 feet at its deepest portion. Shrapnel pieces could also be seen laid out as they were collected for further analysis.

No casualties were reported but hours before the attack, children had been attending the school.

Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in the images and videos taken by CNN at the site of the crater, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army.

He said it was difficult to identify the exact model due to the lack of reference images.

Iranian missile appears to hit less than a kilometer from Mossad headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, on October 1, 2024, in videos verified by CNN.

Social media

Of the approximately 180 missiles the Israel Defense Forces say Iran fired Tuesday night, at least three apparent targets have emerged from a CNN analysis of geolocated videos of the attack.

It’s still too early to tell whether the attack resulted in any serious damage – that will require daylight and likely satellite imagery – but by analyzing the videos from the attack we have a picture of what Iran targeted.

Footage shows a significant concentration of missiles fell either at, or near, the headquarters of Mossad, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base.

Those locations largely tally with what the US intelligence community, and the Israelis, believed would be targeted. The facility, one of Israel’s largest, was previously hit by Iran during its April 13 attack (the IDF said the damage was minimal.)

In the area of the Tel Nof base, more than 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, another video showed a number of impacts.

Jordan has vowed it “will not be a battleground for anyone,” after an Iranian missile attack on Israel ramped up tensions across the Middle East and compounded fears of a wider conflict.

The Ministry of Interior said missile fragments had fallen in different parts of the country including the capital Amman.

Three people sustained minor injuries from falling missiles and debris, according to al-Momani. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the system an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.

Meanwhile, the **Arrow 3** uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of missile interceptions during the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel. While the Israeli military claimed to have shot down "most" of the missiles, and the US Navy and Jordan also intercepted missiles, the evidence does not specify the exact percentage of interceptions by the Iron Dome. The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles is not directly supported by the provided sources.

The sources mention that Iran stated that 90% of its missiles hit their targets, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain.

To verify the claim, specific data on the Iron Dome's interception rate during the attack is needed.

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

**WATCH:** [Middle East again on edge after largest aerial attack ever launched against Israel](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/middle-east-again-on-edge-after-largest-aerial-attack-ever-launched-against-israel)

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel. According to a Wikipedia article, the attack involved approximately 200 ballistic missiles, and Israel claimed to have shot down most of them, while Iran stated that 90% of its missiles hit their targets. The article also mentions that the US Navy and Jordan reported intercepting missiles. Al Jazeera reports that Iran launched an attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets. CNN also reports on the missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and mentions that the Iron Dome system has been in the headlines.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of missile interceptions during the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel. While the Israeli military claimed to have shot down "most" of the missiles, and the US Navy and Jordan also intercepted missiles, the evidence does not specify the exact percentage of interceptions by the Iron Dome. The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles is not directly supported by the provided sources.

The sources mention that Iran stated that 90% of its missiles hit their targets, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain.

To verify the claim, specific data on the Iron Dome's interception rate during the attack is needed.

Content: "JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 1 NatSec Brief: December 6, 2024 October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime Ari Cicurel Assistant Director of Foreign Policy Yoni Tobin Policy Analyst Iran has threatened another strike against Israel in recent days. That changed with Iran’s October 1 missile attack against Israel, which cost Tehran relatively more to execute than it cost Israel and the United States to defend against, while yielding minimal tactical or strategic success for the regime. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 3 » Assuming Iran fired 180 missiles and used similar missile variants in the attack, Israel’s figures demonstrate that Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) cost the regime at least $12 million apiece—far costlier than previous public estimates. Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack cost the regime around $2.3 billion, at least four and six times the estimated cost (and at least 124 and 42 times more in terms of GDP per capita) for the United States and Israel, respectively, to defend against it. According to a Tasnim sum- mary of his remarks, Larijani said, “relevant officials \[in Iran’s\] military and government are preparing measures to show \[a\] proper response to recent Israeli aggression against Iran.” » Iran’s previous direct attack against Israel—its October 1 missile strike—inflicted minimal damage despite Iran launching approximately 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli airspace. » To defend itself against this incessant barrage, Israel has relied on its Iron Dome system, which—while greatly effective at an interception rate of roughly 90 percent—has accrued high costs. ⚫ On November 12, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Iran’s October 1 missile attack cost the Iranian regime $2.3 billion. Costs of October 1 Missile Attack Israel United States Iran Low-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $360,000,000 $116,400,000 $2,300,000,000 (Number provided by Israel) High-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $630,000,000 $334,000,000 GDP Per Capita (2023 est.) World Bank Figures $52,260 $81,695 $4,502 ⚫ Given that around 180 missiles entered Israeli airspace in the attack, the maximum conceiv- able cost for Israel to defend against Iran’s October 1 attack—assuming a ratio of one inter- ceptor fired per inbound missile—was significant but smaller than Iran’s: between $360 mil- lion and $630 million, according to JINSA estimates. ⚫ The regional war of attrition started by Hamas’s October 7 attack has put Israel and the United States on the wrong side of the cost-curve defending against aerial attacks by con- ventionally weaker Iranian proxies. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 2 In addition, the attack proved costly in tactical terms for Iran, yielding serious IDF blowback that compromised key elements of the regime’s nuclear programs and ballistic missile pro- duction programs, and took out the regime’s top air defenses."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
According to a JINSA report from December 6, 2024, the Iron Dome's interception rate was roughly 90 percent during the October 1 missile attack. The report also mentions the high costs associated with the defense.

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:5540>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:5541>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Residents gather on a street leading to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, after a drone fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon targeted his house and exploded nearby. (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

Advertisement

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

A meme [posted](https://www.facebook.com/Gil.Nathan15/posts/122143061114318176)

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

A “Palestinian terrorist” attempted to drive a car at a police vehicle at the entrance to the Ofra settlement in the Israeli occupied West Bank, the IDF said this morning.

It said the driver of the vehicle was killed and that no Israeli soldiers were injured.

The IDF added that the incident was under review.

Drone strike launched from Lebanon towards Netanyahu’s house, no casualties reported

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

IDF says 55 projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel this morning

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Analysis: Sinwar’s final moments evoke uncomfortable parallels to Israel hero

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

Reporting from Aitou, Lebanon

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

The militant group's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October.

Israel's military said about 200 projectiles were fired Saturday from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. 

A 50-year-old man was hit by shrapnel and killed in northern Israel, and four other people were wounded, Israel's medical services said. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead.

 Saturday, with no casualties, as fighting with Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Gaza-based Hamas showed no pause after the killing of the Hamas mastermind of last year's Oct. 7 attack.

Israel's military said dozens of projectiles were launched from Lebanon a day after Hezbollah announced a new phase in fighting. Netanyahu's office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

There was no information given about where the drone was launched from or who might be responsible for the attempted attack. Israel did not say if the drone was intercepted or landed elsewhere.

It's the second strike aimed at Netanyahu in recent months."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Shia group, allied to Iran, said it planned to send more guided missiles and explosive drones into Israel.

Israeli police at the scene targeted by a drone, in Caesarea, Israel, on Saturday. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway. Two patients died due to oxygen shortages, medics said.

Al-Awda hospital in the Jabalia neighbourhood of [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 City, already struggling to deal with the aftermath of a nearby strike overnight on Friday that killed 33 people, was also targeted by tank shelling that injured several staff members, the director said in a statement.

The killing of Sinwar in the southern city of Rafah after a year-long hunt for the architect of the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered the war in Gaza briefly raised hopes that an elusive ceasefire and hostage release deal could be reached.

Both Israel and Hamas, however, have so far stuck to their incompatible positions. The Lebanese militia Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for the attack, but said it fired several barrages of rockets at northern and central Israel, which killed a 50-year-old man in Acre.

The rocket attacks came after Hezbollah said on Friday it had entered a new phase of the full-scale war that began with Israel’s ground invasion of southern [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 earlier this month."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the evidence explicitly states that neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present during the attack and that there were no casualties. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Study debunks nuclear test misinformation following 2024 Iran earthquake
========================================================================

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

Was it a ” Iran’s Nuclear Test ” or “Earthquake ? <image:8955>

**The Seismic Event**

The earthquake occurred in Aradan, Semnan, with its epicenter a mere 10 kilometers beneath the surface, which is relatively shallow for seismic activities of this nature. <image:8957>

**Counterarguments for a Natural Earthquake**

*   **Seismological Normality**: Iran sits on major fault lines, making it one of the most earthquake-prone countries. The global community watches, with bated breath, for any developments that might clarify the nature of this seismic event.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

 These timeframes were unrealistic, given the conditions on the ground as many interviewees described their journey along the Salah al-Din Road taking far longer than usual due to traffic congestion caused by the sudden mass movement of people, residents forced to walk due to other transportation means being inaccessible, and newly established checkpoints.

Rami, a 34-year-old-man living in Jabalia with his wife and three children, said he and his family left their home on October 13, 2023, after receiving automated telephone calls from the Israelis to leave the area in which their home was located and head south immediately.[\[138\]](#_ftn138)
 “The dark irony is that they were bombing the area since October 7,” he said, “and after a whole week of that \[the Israeli military\] told us to leave.”[\[139\]](#_ftn139)
 He described the Salah al-Din Road journey:

> We were not attacked directly, but many bombs were dropped in spots behind us and very close to us; one of them was less than 100 meters away. People are being deprived of access to services essential for their survival, including medical facilities, shelters, water wells and humanitarian supplies.[\[179\]](#_ftn179)

On August 26, UN aid operations in Gaza were forced to stop after the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders for Deir al-Balah in central Gaza where the UN operations center is located.[\[180\]](#_ftn180)
 The evacuation order came as the UN prepared to begin a campaign to vaccinate an estimated 640,000 children in Gaza, where the WHO said a 10-month-old baby had been paralyzed by the type 2 poliovirus,[\[181\]](#_ftn181)
 the first such case in the territory in 25 years.[\[182\]](#_ftn182)

Al-Mawasi
---------

In October 2023, Israel designated an area in al-Mawasi – a Palestinian Bedouin town on the southern coast of Gaza – a “humanitarian zone.”[\[207\]](#_ftn207)
 According to the UN, the area is approximately one kilometer wide and fourteen kilometers long and is mostly barren and sandy.[\[208\]](#_ftn208)
 There is no running water in al-Mawasi.

Since designating al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone” the Israeli military has defined different boundaries for the area on at least fourteen different occasions on its various communications channels.[\[209\]](#_ftn209)
 On April 28, 2024, the area was expanded eastward to the Salah al-Din Road and northward to include most of Deir al-Balah.[\[210\]](#_ftn210)
 From July 22, 2024 onwards, claiming that the eastern part of al-Mawasi was used to launch rockets towards Israel, the Israeli military reduced the size of the humanitarian zone and urged people in the area eliminated to move to areas within the reduced zone.[\[211\]](#_ftn211)
 Between July 22 and August 25, the Israeli military redefined and reduced the size of the boundaries of the “humanitarian zone” at least six times. Human Rights Watch could find no communication from the Israeli authorities through any medium directing people to evacuate from those areas within the humanitarian zone on October 18 that were excluded on December 6.

On April 20, 2024, the Israeli military attacked tents sheltering displaced people inside the boundaries of al-Mawasi humanitarian zone. “Yesterday, it was 200 meters from us…We keep hearing the Israeli air forces all the time in the sky above us,” she said.[\[231\]](#_ftn231)

Palestinians inspect the site following Israeli strikes on a tent camp sheltering displaced people in the al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, on September 10, 2024.

On May 6, the Israeli military ordered all eastern Rafah neighborhoods to evacuate “immediately” and seek shelter in the al-Mawasi area of the governorate – an area that humanitarian organizations stated was not equipped to accommodate more displaced people.[\[235\]](#_ftn235)
 The Israeli military started airstrikes on eastern Rafah that same day.[\[236\]](#_ftn236)

Every interviewee Human Rights Watch spoke to said they did not feel safe in Rafah.

After fleeing Jabalia in the north, Ziad described having to move with his family several times inside Rafah governorate because of Israeli airstrikes in the area:

> The Israelis say Rafah is safe. Farah said there had been Israeli bombardments “200 to 250 meters from her home.”[\[239\]](#_ftn239)
 On February 12, 2024, the Israeli military said it had struck a number of “terror targets” in the Shaboura district of Rafah and the strikes had concluded.[\[240\]](#_ftn240)
 Various media outlets reported scores of fatalities.

A Palestinian man looks at the destruction of al-Farouq Mosque and other nearby houses caused by Israeli attacks, in the Shaboura camp in Rafah on February 22, 2024. Some of this destruction appears to clearly go beyond what is militarily necessary and demonstrates an intention to systematically destroy parts of Gaza, frustrating the right to return.

On August 1, 2024, the UN said “the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip has produced a volume of debris that is 14 times greater than the combined total from all conflicts over the past 16 years.”[\[325\]](#_ftn325)
 The United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) estimated the amount of debris in Gaza at 37 million tons in mid-April, or 300 kilograms per square meter stating that there was more rubble than in Ukraine, and that the rubble is likely heavily contaminated with unexploded ordnance.[\[326\]](#_ftn326)
 On May 2, 2024, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) estimated that it would take between US$40 and $50 billion to rebuild Gaza and require an effort on a scale the world has not seen since World War II.[\[327\]](#_ftn327)

Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure
--------------------------------------

On February 8, 2024, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said that his office had recorded “widespread destruction and demolition by the Israeli military of civilian and other infrastructure, including residential buildings, schools and universities in areas in which fighting is not or no longer taking place.”[\[328\]](#_ftn328)
 Türk’s observations covered the period since late October 2023, but he noted reports of destroyed residential buildings and blocks taking place in Khan Younis at the time of his statement. Since October 7, 2023, at least 65 schools were completely destroyed, while 344 schools – representing 61 percent of total school buildings in Gaza – were directly hit.[\[363\]](#_ftn363)
 Widespread damage includes 156 out of the 187 UNRWA school buildings in Gaza, which have been either directly hit or damaged through strikes.[\[364\]](#_ftn364)

In North Gaza governorate, the Education Cluster classified 98 percent of school buildings in this governorate as having been either directly hit or damaged, which includes severe damage to school infrastructure according to the Cluster and UNOSAT’s classification.[\[365\]](#_ftn365)
 The Education Cluster’s assessment also found that at least 85 percent of schools in Gaza will either need “full reconstruction” or “major rehabilitation work” to be functional again.[\[366\]](#_ftn366)

According to the Scholars at Risk Network, Israeli forces have also significantly damaged, demolished or destroyed all of Gaza’s universities, including the Islamic University of Gaza;[\[367\]](#_ftn367)
 al-Aqsa University,[\[368\]](#_ftn368)
 which was functioning as a shelter at the time of the attack; al-Israa University, reportedly used by Israeli forces as a military base and a detention and interrogation center, according to Scholars at Risk;[\[369\]](#_ftn369)
 University College of Science and Technology, Palestine;[\[370\]](#_ftn370)
 al-Azhar University;[\[371\]](#_ftn371)
 and the Gaza branch of al-Quds Open University.[\[372\]](#_ftn372)

On April 18, 2024, UN experts expressed grave concern over the education loss of over 625,000 children, the pattern of attacks on schools and universities, and the killing of students, teachers and university professors in Gaza, as well as the destruction of its public libraries."

Israel’s Western allies slam Israeli minister’s remark that Gaza starvation may be justified
============================================================================================

             ![FILE - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich speaks at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, in Jerusalem, on July 10, 2023. 7 attack on southern Israel are returned home.

Finance Minister [Bezalel Smotrich](https://apnews.com/hub/bezalel-smotrich/)
 said in a speech on Monday that Israel had no choice but to send humanitarian aid into Gaza.

“It’s not possible in today’s global reality to manage a war — no one will allow us to starve 2 million people, even though that might be just and moral until they return the hostages,” he said at a conference in support of Jewish settlements.

Smotrich, a key partner in [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition](https://apnews.com/video/district-of-columbia-israel-government-united-states-government-protests-and-demonstrations-national-79bb998b2a8d4c4795c8323147bf5989)
, supports the reoccupation of Gaza, the rebuilding of Jewish settlements that were removed in 2005, and what he describes as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians out of the territory.

The European Union on Wednesday condemned his remarks, noting that the “deliberate starvation of civilians is a war crime.”

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the remarks “beyond ignominious,” saying “it demonstrates, once again, his contempt for international law and for basic principles of humanity.”

[A crowd surge at an aid site in Gaza run by an Israeli-backed group kills 20 Palestinians](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-aid-organization-gaza-stampede-5c7b1562c8faecd127fd0050b2fa52a8) 

David Lammy, Britain’s new foreign secretary, said “there can be no justification for Minister Smotrich’s remarks.”

“We expect the wider Israeli government to retract and condemn them,” he wrote on the social media platform X.

Germany’s ambassador to Israel, Steffen Siebert, called the remarks “unacceptable and appalling.”

“It is a principle of international law and of humanity to protect civilians in a war and to give them access to water and food,” he wrote on X.

Egypt’s foreign ministry on Thursday also condemned Smotrich’s remarks, describing them as “shameful statements unacceptable in form and substance” and a violation of international humanitarian law.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. The geolocation search suggests that the image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image, such as whether it was taken in a bomb shelter or the date it was taken. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The Israeli military said early on Sunday that it had launched a series of preemptive strikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon based on intelligence it says indicated that the militant group was planning an attack.

Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari [said](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1827527034400047151)
 in a video on X that the military acted in “self defense” to “remove these threats.”

Netanyahu said he wanted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah — as well as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — to know that the operation was “another step on the path to changing the situation in the north and returning our residents safely to their homes.”

Iran has provided money and weapons to both Hezbollah and Hamas.

On Sunday, Nasrallah said in a public address that Hezbollah delayed its retaliatory attack against Israel because of recent Israeli and U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said President Biden was “closely monitoring events in Israel and Lebanon.”

The latest wave of attacks comes as Egypt hosts a new round of cease-fire talks aimed at getting Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas closer to a deal for a cease-fire in Gaza, after almost 11 months of fighting between the two sides following the surprise attack against Israel on Oct. <image:9023>

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich slams Attorney General Gali Baharv-Miara for criticizing a cabinet decision regarding the placement of mobile bomb shelters in illegal West Bank outposts, which she said was the result of an improper decision-making process.

“We will continue to fix, regulate, and create de facto sovereignty, and the attorney general will continue to interfere,” Smotrich tweets, saying that West Bank settlers also have “the right to life.”

Thanking “the cabinet ministers for voting unanimously in favor of the decision,” Smotrich says that “we are continuing together and with all our strength for the sake of settlement and security.”

In a letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the attorney general said that the resolution was not put on the cabinet’s agenda, did not receive professional scrutiny from the security services, and had not been presented to the cabinet ministers with the budget impact assessment and legal position paper necessary for such decisions.

She insisted that such decisions are in the purview of professional officials in the IDF, “as determined by a broad view of the array of risks in relation to all the country’s citizens, and the extent \[of those risks\],” and asserted that only the defense minister is responsible for such decisions.

In response, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) accused Baharav-Miara of making a “series of claims disconnected from reality,” and insisted that the decision-making process was lawful, saying that the proposal was debated in the cabinet back on October 1.

Since announcing plans to invade northern Gaza and expel Palestinians again to the south, Israel has attacked displacement shelters in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Zeitoun, according to an investigation by Sanad, Al Jazeera’s verification unit.

Since August 13, Sanad has found that Israel stepped up the bombardment and shelling of Zeitoun, and often directly hit displacement shelters.

The siege and ongoing violence have compelled thousands of Palestinians to close their tents in the camps and flee further south, according to satellite imagery obtained by Sanad.

Israel is deliberately pushing people south as part of its invasion of northern Gaza (Al Jazeera)

The indiscriminate bombardment of civilian homes and displacement shelters is part of a broad pattern of Israeli war tactics that make no distinction between civilians and fighters.

Human rights groups, United Nations experts and numerous legal scholars believe Israel’s nearly two-year war on Gaza amounts to genocide.

Israel’s Western allies – who have long defended it from criticism by claiming it has the “right to defend itself” – are becoming increasingly alarmed at the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the enclave.

Many are calling on Israel to end the war and warning that its plan to seize northern Gaza could further exacerbate the suffering of civilians. The mass displacement and bombardment of Zeitoun encapsulate the atrocities resulting from Israel’s invasion.

Israel attacking displacement camps in Zeitoun (Al Jazeera)

Attacking shelters
------------------

There are about 11 displacement shelters in Zeitoun, each sheltering 4,000 to 4,500 besieged and hungry Palestinians.

Most live on just 3.2sq km (1.2sq miles), which makes up just 32 percent of the pre-war size of Zeitoun.

At the start of the war, Israel dug trenches in and around the neighbourhood, claiming it was creating a ‘buffer zone”, and built the Netzarim Corridor, which has split Gaza into two zones.

![INTERACTIVE - Shelters in Zeitoun neighbourhood-1755592771](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/INTERACTIVE-Shelters-in-Zeitoun-neighbourhood-1755592771.png?quality=80)

\[Al Jazeera\]

Israel’s recent bombardment of the neighbourhood is terrifying civilians into fleeing south, leading to another cycle of forced displacement that may amount to ethnic cleansing due to Israel’s attempt to destroy all livable facilities and structures.

An Al Jazeera journalist on the ground recently captured footage of Israel firing a missile directly at a home in Zeitoun.

While it is unclear whether anyone was inside, it is clear that all structures are being levelled, possibly to make it more difficult for any survivors to try to relocate to the area.

According to Sanad, there is clear evidence that Israel is pursuing that policy in and around Zeitoun. Between August 11 and 16, sources documented Israel’s attack on al-Falah School in Zeitoun and a tent camp on al-Lababidi Street.

Both the Majida al-Wasila school in the Nassr neighbourhood and tents in the Sheikh Ajilin neighbourhood were also hit.

This pattern of direct attacks on tents and school shelters – the last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians – may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, since these structures are protected under international humanitarian law.

Some dreams do come true.

At night, I dream of the rising screech of sirens across Jerusalem, of running to a bomb shelter, of thinking wildly about my grown children elsewhere in Israel dashing through dark streets for safety as missiles whoosh overhead. I take morning runs through my untouched neighborhood, with my map app set to show public bomb shelters. People who do not have bomb shelters or the reinforced rooms required by regulation in newer buildings camp out with friends or family members, if they can. I receive a text message purporting to be from the Israeli military warning that terrorists will target bomb shelters, so people should stay away from them. My wife and I ran for shelter, where we learned from news bulletins that Israel was bombing Iran. He is an Israeli journalist and historian whose most recent book is _War of Shadows: Codebreakers, Spies, and the Secret Struggle to Drive the Nazis From the Middle East._

The Israelis killed by missiles get less coverage, my daughter points out, than if they’d been killed in terror bombings during the Second Intifada. “Israeli intelligence has uncovered the fact that Iran has begun the process of the ‘breakthrough’” to creating a bomb.

I cannot dismiss this evaluation."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024. The search results also show that Bezalel Smotrich has been involved in discussions about bomb shelters. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during the August 25, 2024 attacks.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: "They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The CNN and Wikipedia articles discuss the Nuseirat refugee camp and the events of June 8, 2024, but do not mention the children in the image or the alleged incident at the Al-Jaoni UN school. The geolocation data suggests the image was not necessarily taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, while the provided articles discuss events on June 8, 2024. The articles do not mention the children.

More information is needed to verify the claim, including confirmation of the children's identities, the date of the incident, and the location.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
