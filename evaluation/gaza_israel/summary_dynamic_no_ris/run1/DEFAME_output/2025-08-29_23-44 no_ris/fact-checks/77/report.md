## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources confirm that an earthquake occurred in Israel on October 5, 2024. An article from Johns Hopkins University, published on February 4, 2025, mentions an earthquake in Iran in October 2024 and misinformation linking it to a seismic event in Israel the same evening (![image 8946](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513125-580289.jpg)).

NDTV published an article on October 7, 2024, discussing earthquakes in Iran and Israel on October 5, 2024, which sparked speculation about covert nuclear testing (<image:k>). Another article from alphadefense.in, published on October 7, 2024, discusses a seismic event in Iran's Semnan province on October 5, 2024 (![image 8953](media/2025-08-30_00-19-1756513159-182997.jpg), ![image 8954](media/2025-08-30_00-19-1756513170-122178.jpg), ![image 8955](media/2025-08-30_00-19-1756513171-965822.jpg), ![image 8957](media/2025-08-30_00-19-1756513174-699961.jpg)).
