## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A U.S.-flagged container ship, the Maersk Sentosa, was targeted in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024, by a "flying object" in the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden according to [gCaptain.com](https://gcaptain.com/u-s-flagged-containership-targeted-by-flying-object-in-gulf-of-aden/). The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack. The crew and vessel are safe.

Another article from [The Columbian](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/) mentions that the attack was on a U.S.-flagged container ship in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday. The article is dated August 29, 2025. Additionally, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_attacks_on_commercial_vessels) mentions that on April 9, 2024, the US-flagged container ship _Maersk Yorktown_ was targeted by an anti-ship missile in the Gulf of Aden.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a U.S.-flagged container ship, the Maersk Sentosa, was targeted in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack. The evidence also mentions an attack on the US-flagged container ship _Maersk Yorktown_ on April 9, 2024.

The provided evidence does not include a statement from a spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk.

The claim is partially verified. The attack on a US-flagged vessel in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024 is confirmed. However, the statement from Maersk's spokesperson cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. A U.S.-flagged vessel was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not verify the statement from a Maersk spokesperson.

`false`
