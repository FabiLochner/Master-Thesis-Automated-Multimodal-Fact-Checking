DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted United States-flagged container ship in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday, officials said, the latest assault by the group on the crucial maritime trade route.

The captain of the ship reported an explosion in close proximity to the vessel off the coast of Nishtun, Yemen, close to the country’s border with Oman, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said. Navy, identified the ship as the Maersk Sentosa.

The explosion took place in the farthest reaches of the waterway earlier targeted by the rebels, the center said.

It did not elaborate on what caused the explosion, though the Houthis have been known to use drones and missiles as well as bomb-carrying drone boats.

Late Tuesday night, the Houthis issued a broad claim of responsibility for three attacks, which included the Maersk Sentosa. Yahya Saree said the group was responsible for two attacks on ships in the Red Sea, but it wasn’t immediately clear which ship was the one reported by the information center.

The Houthis also said they used a drone boat in a June 27 attack on a Malta-flagged bulk carrier, Seajoy.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over 13 U.N. Since the latest assault, shipping or military authorities have not acknowledged any additional attacks in the region.

The last reported Houthi attack in the region took place June 28.

The rebels have targeted more than 70 vessels by firing missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They seized one vessel and sank two since November.

In June, the number of Houthi attacks on merchant vessels increased to levels not seen since December, according to the JMIC. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the Israel-Hamas war — including some bound for Iran.

On June 28, five missiles landed near a Liberian-flagged tanker, Delinox, as it traveled off the coast of the rebel-held port city of Hodeida, according to the JMIC. U.S.-led airstrikes have targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes on May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.

The Houthis maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain as part of rebel support for the militant group Hamas in its war against Israel in the Gaza Strip. We continue to be refused access to them,” the office said in a statement.

Maersk confirmed details of the incident in a statement to gCaptain, noting that the vessel _Maersk Sentosa_ was targeted by a “flying object” in the “northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden” in the early hours of July 9th. A containership operated by Maersk’s U.S.-flagged shipping arm reported an attack in the eastern Gulf of Aden as the Iranian-backed Houthis continue to attack ships over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) office said it received a report of an incident 180 nautical miles east of Nishtun, Yemen. The _Maersk Sentosa_ is operated by Maersk Line, Limited, a subsidiary of Maersk that operates US-flagged vessels.

AIS data from [MarineTraffic.com](http://marinetraffic.com/)
 shows the _Maersk Sentosa_ is underway from Algeciras, Spain to Salalah, Oman.

This incident marks the first attack against a merchant ship reported by the UKMTO office since June 28th. and European naval forces have reported incidents involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vessels (USVs) in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea this month.

It is important to note that this latest incident occurred far outside the Houthis’ traditional threat area near the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, where most Houthi attacks have been focused. The Houthis later claimed that the first use of a “locally made hypersonic missile” was used in the attack.

Since mid-November, the Iranian-backed Houthis have launched more than 80 attacks against merchant ships from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

_[Galaxy Leader](/wiki/Galaxy_Leader "Galaxy Leader")
_ at Bremerhaven, 2006. The Greek-owned and Malta-flagged vessel, which came from Vietnam and was en route to Israel, was able to continue transiting the Red Sea.[\[23\]](#cite_note-Reuters20240116-23)
[\[123\]](#cite_note-123)

On 17 January, Houthis struck the US-owned bulk carrier MV _Genco Picardy_ with a drone while it traversed the Gulf of Aden, causing minimal damage and no injuries to the crew.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Livingstone20240117-24)
[\[124\]](#cite_note-124)
 The Indian Navy announced the following day that [INS _Visakhapatnam_](/wiki/INS_Visakhapatnam "INS Visakhapatnam")
 was diverted to rescue the ship's crew of 22 people. Following the incident, the two vessels were ordered back to the [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 by US Navy instruction with Navy escort and [Maersk Line Limited](/wiki/Maersk_Line_Limited "Maersk Line Limited")
, a subsidiary that sails primarily US government-owned goods, suspended all sailings in the Red Sea.[\[27\]](#cite_note-lli-20240124-27)
[\[127\]](#cite_note-marex-20240124-127)
[\[128\]](#cite_note-128)

On 26 January, a Houthi ballistic missile fired toward USS _Carney_ was shot down.[\[129\]](#cite_note-129)
 The same day, the [_Marlin Luanda_](/wiki/Marlin_Luanda_missile_strike "Marlin Luanda missile strike")
, an oil tanker operated by British company Oceonix Services on behalf of [Trafigura](/wiki/Trafigura "Trafigura")
, carrying Russian-produced [naphtha](/wiki/Naphtha "Naphtha")
, was hit by a missile as it traversed the Gulf of Aden 60 nautical miles (110 km; 69 mi) southeast of Aden, according to UK Maritime Trade Operations. Ambrey reported that a Barbados-flagged British ship received minor damage to its port 57 nautical miles (106 km; 66 mi) from the coast of Hodeidah, and the UKMTO said that it also received reports that the port side of a ship was struck by a projectile west of Hodeidah and a small craft was seen nearby.[\[29\]](#cite_note-theguardian20240206-29)
 The second ship, which the UKMTO identified as a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned vessel originating from the US and en route to India, was attacked off the coast of Aden. Later the ship continued towards her next destination.[\[152\]](#cite_note-152)
[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)
 Another missile landed in close proximity to the nearby Antigua and Barbuda-flagged MV _Maisha_, causing no damage.[\[154\]](#cite_note-154)

On 29 April, Houthis attacked the Malta-flagged merchant vessel MV _Cyclades_ with anti-ship missiles and UAVs, causing minor damage.[\[45\]](#cite_note-apnews20240429-45)
 The Houthis also claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Portugal-flagged _MSC Orion_ that day, directly striking her around 600 kilometres (370 mi) off the coast of Yemen while she was in the Arabian Sea, making it the furthest attack by the Houthis so far.[\[46\]](#cite_note-apnews20240430-46)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-155)
 In response to the increased range, the EU's [Operation Atalanta](/wiki/Operation_Atalanta "Operation Atalanta")
 advised for an alternative shipping route to be established at least 150 nautical miles (280 km; 170 mi) east of the current route.[\[156\]](#cite_note-156)

### Fourth phase (May – July 2024)

In early May 2024, in what he described as the "fourth stage" of the attacks, Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi vowed to attack ships of any company related to Israel or carrying goods for Israel in response to Israel's [Rafah offensive](/wiki/Rafah_offensive "Rafah offensive")
 in southern Gaza.[\[157\]](#cite_note-157)

On 9 May, the Houthis claimed responsibility for attacks on three Panama-flagged container ships."

Beyond that slip-up, the Ohio senator got yelled at, indirectly, by Trump for not showing up to Senate votes, which he had just suggested weren’t that important.

### TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was removed from an African Union session on the Rwandan genocide after several African countries objected to his presence, reviving diplomatic tensions over Israel’s observer status.

[\- World news -](/en/service/1194/world)

Avraham Neguise was expelled from Mandela Hall at the African Union headquarters on Monday.

The removal occurred during an annual session focused on the Rwandan genocide.

According to Al Jazeera, the ambassador's participation was not anticipated, and several African delegations objected to his presence.

Diplomatic sources said the meeting was paused until Neguise left the room.

The African Union has reportedly launched an investigation to determine who authorized the Israeli ambassador's attendance.

Since the formation of the African Union in 2002, 87 non-African countries have been granted observer status, which allows them to attend meetings and engage in discussions without voting rights.

The first organization to be granted observer status was the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973, which continues to receive broad support from African member states.

Israel gained observer status in 2021 in an effort to counter Palestinian influence within the bloc.

However, its status was later rescinded following objections from several African countries, which argued that Israel had violated the AU Charter due to its ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories.

This marks the second time an Israeli diplomat has been ejected from an AU meeting.

In February 2023, an Israeli delegation was removed from the opening ceremony of the AU summit in Addis Ababa.

The Israeli foreign ministry blamed South Africa and Algeria for what it described as a severe diplomatic breach.

According to the Israeli news site Walla, security personnel escorted the Israeli delegates out during the event.

AU member states have consistently opposed Israel’s participation, citing the ongoing war in Gaza and the genocide against the Palestinian people.

Although Israel regained observer status in 2021, Algerian diplomats moved to revoke it in January 2022.

**JERUSALEM / ISTANBUL** 

Israel’s ambassador to Ethiopia Avraham Neguise was expelled on Monday from a conference on the Rwandan genocide organized by the African Union in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

A Foreign Ministry statement said that Neguise was thrown out after member states refused to participate alongside him in the conference.

The ministry also condemned statements made by Mahmoud Youssouf, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, during the event.

“It is outrageous that at an event commemorating the victims of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, to which the Israeli ambassador in Addis Ababa was invited, \[Youssouf\] chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements,” it said.

In July 2021, Israel said that it had rejoined the African Union as an observer member.

Neguise, a former lawmaker for the ruling Likud Party, has been Israel’s ambassador to Ethiopia since August 2024.

In February 2023, an Israeli diplomat was expelled from the 36th African Union summit of heads of state held in Addis Ababa.

The incident came as the Israeli army renewed a deadly assault on Gaza on March 18 and has since killed more than 1,400 people, injured over 3,400 others, and shattered a January ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement in the enclave.

Over 50,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in a brutal Israeli onslaught since October 2023, most of them women and children.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, [Avraham Neguise](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)
, was reportedly expelled from an annual conference on the Rwandan genocide held in the Mandela Hall at the African Union’s headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on Monday, April 7.

Neguise was expelled after several delegations of different African countries objected to his participation in the conference, which was paused until he left the hall. 

!Israeli diplomat booted from AU conference <image:8426>

Ethiopian-born Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia expelled from AU session, Avraham Neguise. As his participation was unexpected, the African Union is reportedly conducting an [investigation](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-african-union-headquarters/)
 to detect who invited him. Neguise served as a member of the Knesset with the far-right Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from 2015 to 2019.

The expulsion of the senior Israeli diplomat is seen as part of a wider protest by many African countries against Israel’s genocidal aggression on the besieged Gaza strip, which has continued for over a year and a half, and claimed the lives of over [50,800 Palestinians](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/mid-east/israel-kills-58-more-palestinians-as-gaza-death-toll-tops-50800)
, according to official estimates from Gaza’s Ministry of Health.

It is worth noting that the African Union joined a case filed in the International Court of Justice ([ICJ](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250407-israel-envoy-expelled-from-au-meeting/)
) by South Africa against Israel’s genocide in Gaza in February 2025.

### **Israel condemned the expulsion of Neguise**

Unabashed by his government’s continuous massacres against Palestinians, the spokesperson of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, [Oren Marmorstein](https://themedialine.org/headlines/israel-condemns-expulsion-of-ambassador-from-african-union-genocide-event/)
, condemned the action taken by the African Union against Neguise calling it a distortion of history, which “harms the memory of the murdered.”

“It is outrageous that, at an event commemorating the victims of the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, to which the Israeli ambassador in Addis Ababa was invited, the chairman of the African Union Commission from Djibouti chose to introduce anti-Israel political elements,” Marmorstein stated.

### **Israel’s international isolation grows as the genocide continues in Gaza**

As Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues unrelenting, more countries are demonstrating their condemnation of its war crimes through diplomatic, political, economic, and legal actions.

One day after the African Union expelled the Israeli ambassador from the conference, the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister, [Caspar Veldkamp](https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/dutch-foreign-minister-summons-israeli-ambassador-over-gaza)
, summoned the Israeli ambassador in the Netherlands over the situation in Gaza.

The move came after the Netherlands [announced](https://evrimagaci.org/tpg/dutch-government-tightens-military-export-restrictions-to-israel-316048)
 on Monday “a significant tightening of restrictions on the export of military and dual-use goods to Israel” over the situation in the besieged enclave.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025, not expelled by Ethiopia. The conference was focused on the Rwandan genocide. The expulsion occurred because member states refused to participate alongside him.

The claim is therefore inaccurate.

Shiri Bibas was kidnapped with her two children during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023

Israel has said Israeli children Ariel and Kfir Bibas, who were taken hostage on 7 October 2023, were "deliberately" killed by their captors in Gaza.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said "forensic findings", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with "bare hands".

He said evidence had been shared with Israel's "partners around the world so they can verify it".

Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence.

The bodies of the two boys were returned to Israel on Thursday, alongside the body of another hostage, Oded Lifschitz. This is an anonymous, unidentified body."

"This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organisation, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages."

A Hamas spokesman, Ismail al-Thawabta, said on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under the rubble of a structure after an Israeli air strike.

The group told Reuters news agency they would investigate what had led to the wrong remains being sent to Israel.

Israel demanded that Hamas return Shiri along with the other remaining hostages.

"Whether she is alive or not, they need to bring back Shiri Bibas," IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.

Netanyahu said "we will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages - both living and dead - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement".

In a statement, Hamas said it affirmed its "seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations" and had no interest in "non-compliance".

Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.

They have become a symbol for many in Israel and the news that their bodies would be returned to Israel was met with an outpouring of grief.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was "horrified and devastated" that Shiri had not been returned, "despite the agreement and our desperate hopes".

The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February.

Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz.

[Key events that led to Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal in Gaza\
----------------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg4ryde7q5o)

The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over.

The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire.

Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun.

Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged.

Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza.

Israel says forensics show Bibas children killed by captors

! Hamas said a fourth body handed over was that of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas - but Israel said forensic testing showed it was not her.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged Hamas "put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin" instead of the body of Shiri Bibas.

The IDF posted on X that "during the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. No casualties were reported.

In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced he had ordered the IDF to carry out an "intensive operation against centers of terrorism" in the West Bank.

* * * About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive.

About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Also on Thursday, three buses exploded in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, in what Israeli police said is a suspected terror attack.

Devices in two other buses failed to explode, they said."

 Israel refused, demanding that living female hostages be returned before the dead bodies.[\[12\]](#cite_note-WSJ20250219-13)
 On the same day, Hamas also claimed that Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas had been killed by Israeli airstrikes before the truce went into effect.[\[13\]](#cite_note-France24-20231201-14)
 The IDF responded that "Hamas is wholly responsible for the security of all hostages".[\[13\]](#cite_note-France24-20231201-14)

A cousin of the Bibas family requested to speak with US President [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")

### Return of the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas

The status of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas was unclear at the time of Yarden Bibas's release, although they had not been included in earlier releases that prioritized living women and children.[\[63\]](#cite_note-66)
 On 18 February, a Hamas spokesperson announced that the bodies of four hostages, including the remaining members of the Bibas family, would be released on 20 February, as part of the seventh round of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement.[\[64\]](#cite_note-bbc20250218-67)

On 20 February, Hamas released four bodies, reported to be of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas, and a fourth hostage, [Oded Lifshitz](/wiki/Oded_Lifshitz "Oded Lifshitz")

The article also mentions that the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas were returned on February 20, and that a forensic analysis showed they were killed with "bare hands". <image:21> The article also references a BBC article.


## Elaboration
The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family on February 21, 2025. The article discussed the conflicting claims regarding the family's death, with Hamas stating they were killed by an Israeli airstrike and Israel claiming they were killed by their captors. The evidence confirms the existence of a BBC article on the Bibas family, but it does not confirm the exact wording of the headline in the image.

The Bibas family, who were taken hostage

That includes the Bibas family, who welcomed back Yarden on Saturday, but not his wife, Shiri, and two small sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were also taken hostage.

Hamas had previously said they were killed in an Israeli air strike early on in the war - but they were named in [a list of hostages](/news/articles/c0kv0y1vd6mo)
 it said in January it was willing to free.

"A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months," the Bibas family said in statement. "The hope of reuniting with the family and worrying about us was the greatest power, was the only nutrition that he had for his soul."

Gadi was one of 18 hostages released so far this year as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in exchange for 583 Palestinian prisoners.

The ceasefire aims to end 15 months of war in Gaza, after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 as hostages.

Israel's military campaign in response killed more than 47,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN.

Now, as hostages return from more than a year in captivity, details of their conditions are emerging. !Gadi Moses embraces his niece in an Israeli hospital <image:8508>Image source, Efrat Machikawa

**While held hostage by Hamas for 15 months in Gaza, 80-year-old Gadi Moses ate mainly a piece of bread and an olive twice a day, his niece Efrat Machikawa says.**

"I have no idea how he survived," she tells the BBC. Accounts of limited food, with no fresh vegetables, [are similar to conditions reported by Gazans during the war](/news/world-middle-east-68577026)
.

Two former hostages' family members told the BBC they came back thinner.

"We're all very, very excited to have Keith back home, but very worried to see the state that he came back to us in," Tal Wax, the niece of 65-year-old American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who was released on Saturday, said.

"Although we can see that he is able to walk and talk we see that he has lost a lot of weight," she said.

She heard from her cousins and Mr Siegel's wife Aviva that "he had to endure a lot of horrible situations in captivity while still remaining the good person he is."

He is still a vegan, she added.

"Keith is very humane and he wanted to tell us he's still the same person... I'm no longer Hamas's captive, and I'm home."

To families with loved ones still in captivity, "you are not alone" and "we continue to fight for you", she added.

Ms Machikawa said even her uncle's release was a "terrifying" experience.

As crowds surrounded him in Gaza on Thursday, he thought it was the "end of his life", she said.

After he was back in Israel, she was able to sleep for five hours for the first time since his capture.

"I feel like my tension is slowly melting," she said.

On Friday, she ran to embrace her uncle in the hospital, where he gave her "the strongest, most powerful hug", and she let out a "burst of tears of relief and love".

"We understand that the uncle we know is the same one we know but even greater," she said, as he was talking about rehabilitation and being strong, and dreaming of returning to his fields, where he is an agricultural expert.

"Unity and family and devoting yourself for justice and a right cause are greater than anything, because I stopped my life on 7 October," she said.

She thanked Qatar and the US for mediating the deal, and "brave" Red Cross workers who facilitated the releases.

"The joy is amazing", she said, but she has mixed feelings until every hostage is back. "Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country remained "deeply concerned" about their fate.

Another 15 hostages and around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners are still due to be released in the first six weeks of the ceasefire, which started on 19 January.

The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family. The article mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed in an Israeli airstrike. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact headline presented in the image. Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable.

Israel's military says several airstrikes Friday in central Beirut have killed the long-time leader of the Hezbollah militant group, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)
, in what represents another dramatic new development in a conflict that has metastasized across the Middle East region since last October.

In a statement Saturday, Hezbollah confirmed the death of Nasrallah and offered condolences for others killed with him “following the treacherous Zionist raid on the southern suburb.”

The airstrikes Friday had leveled several large residential buildings in southern Beirut, which Israeli officials had almost immediately labeled the headquarters of Hezbollah in statements they issued even as the smoke and debris clouds from the explosion rose above the city.

The Lebanese health ministry announced late Friday that six people had died and more than 90 had been injured by the strikes, but authorities said they were still clearing vast quantities of rubble, meaning those numbers would likely rise.

Denial, terror and bravado in Beirut as residents await next Israeli air attack
===============================================================================

Casualties rising as assault on Hezbollah leaves war-weary nation apprehensive of more pain to come

For months, the staff at Rafik Hariri university hospital had been preparing for the worst. Hospitals in Dahiya transferred patients to Rafik Hariri and other surrounding medical centres after the ministry of health ordered the evacuation of all hospitals in the southern suburbs.

, the southern suburbs of Beirut, sending residents running to the safest place they could think of – the nearby hospital.

People ran to the gates of Rafik Hariri hospital, asking to stay in the car park until the bombing ceased. Staff could not let them in because they had to keep the way clear for incoming wounded and were expecting hundreds of casualties from the airstrikes, which [killed the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
, and levelled a city block. I’m scared that if the situation continues, we will be cut off from everything,” Shoshana Mazraani, the emergency room director of Marjayoun public hospital in south Lebanon, said.

Amir’s neighbour agreed with him that the late leader of Hezbollah, who during [his three-decade command of the group](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/hassan-nasrallah-obituary)
 achieved mythical status among supporters and enemies alike, was not dead. If we’re facing 10 of them, there will be hundred of us,” Amir said, saying that despite the fact that he was Sunni, he supported what he saw as the Shia organisation’s defence of Lebanon against Israel.

Even if some Lebanese might face the prospect of an Israeli invasion with bravado, there were doubts as to whether the Lebanese state was prepared for it.

“They said they had been preparing for a year, but look what happened last Friday."

The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has [raised fears](/world/middle-east/lebanon-border-israel-hezbollahs-deadly-game-patience-2024-07-24/)
 of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries.

The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries.

"Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office.

In a written statement, Hezbollah said: "The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard".

Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions.

The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers.

"They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter...it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel.

Moscow, which has ties with most of the key players in the Middle East, including Israel, Iran, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, condemned the attacks in the Golan Heights.

"We condemn all terrorist actions undertaken by any entity," Russian TASS state news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday.

The Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon.

Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1.

Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters.

In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel.

Netanyahu's far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

"For the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.

The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.

At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said.

Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.

*   Summary

*   Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah denies any role
*   Israeli PM Netanyahu vows Hezbollah will pay price for attack
*   U.S. support for Israel's security was "iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah".

The United States "will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority," the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists.

The Israeli military said after Saturday's attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers.

Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel "to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm".

A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war.

ATTACKS FROM LEBANON
--------------------

Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October.

Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jama'a Islamiya.

More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents."

“The Islamic Resistance has no connection to this incident,” it said, referring to its military wing.

The Iran-aligned group has been exchanging fire with Israeli forces in areas near the Israel-Lebanon border since October 8, when Israel launched its war on Gaza.

People react after a rocket hit the town of Majdal Shams \[Jalaa Marey/AFP\]

The cross-border attacks, which Hezbollah said it launched in solidarity with the Palestinian people amid Israel’s war on Gaza, have led to fears of a larger regional conflagration.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said he would fly home early from his trip to the United States, where he met several senior US officials.

“Immediately upon learning of the disaster in Majdal Shams, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed that his return to Israel be brought forward as quickly as possible,” Netanyahu’s office said in a post on X.

Netanyahu also told the leader of the Druze community in Israel, “Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid,” during a phone call, according to a statement from his office.

A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council condemned the rocket attack, stating, “Our support for Israel’s security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah,”.

Lebanon’s government, in a statement, urged the “immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts” and condemned attacks on civilians.

Fears of escalation
-------------------

Reporting from Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said Saturday’s attack was one of the deadliest single incidents since the cross-border fire began and comes amid growing fears of an escalation.

“Hezbollah is saying this isn’t from them, whereas the Israelis immediately said it was them,” she said, adding that neither side wants an all-out war, “but both sides have said they are prepared for it.”

Gideon Levy, a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz warned that “now things can really get out of control”.

“It’s a dramatic moment. “I don’t think that this will be enough to take us to an all-out war,” he said.

The attack on the football pitch followed an Israeli attack in Lebanon that killed four fighters on Saturday.

Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli attack on Kfar Kila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.

The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah after identifying fighters entering the building.

Hezbollah claimed it carried out at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfar Kila attacks.

The Golan Heights, a 1,200sq-kilometre (463sq-mile) plateau, is Syrian territory that Israel occupied in 1967 after the Six-Day War, before annexing it in 1981, a move the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned.

Many residents in the territory are Syrian Druze, some of whom have Israeli citizenship.

“I don’t see Israel ignoring this incident.”

Political analyst Ori Goldberg said he believed it was unlikely the attack would lead to an “all-out war” between Israel and Hezbollah.

“Both sides don’t want an all-out war, this has been made abundantly clear”, he told Al Jazeera, and noted that the attack took place on Israel’s periphery, rather than in its heartland. Hezbollah is responsible for the killing of innocent children,” Hagari said.

“We will prepare for a response against Hezbollah … we will act,” he said.

Hezbollah swiftly denied responsibility for the attack on Saturday."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 27, 2024, a rocket attack occurred in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulting in casualties. A Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024))) mentions that a Hezbollah rocket struck a soccer field in Majdal Shams, killing 12 children. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) also reported on the attack, stating that 12 people, including children, were killed.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)) reported at least 12 deaths and 30 injuries. Israel accused Hezbollah, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. <image:25>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of children in strawberry fields. One image is from [thekitchn.com](https://www.thekitchn.com/strawberry-picking-with-kids-267547) <image:8521>. Another image is from [istockphoto.com](https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/child-strawberry-picking) <image:8522>.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulted in the death of children. However, the image search results show images of children in strawberry fields, which contrasts with the context of the rocket attack.

The claim states that the image shows the youngest victim of the attack. There is no information in the provided evidence to support this. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, information is needed to connect the image to the victims of the rocket attack. This would require identifying the child in the image and confirming their death in the attack.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 27, 2024, a rocket attack occurred in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulting in casualties. A Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024))) mentions that a Hezbollah rocket struck a soccer field in Majdal Shams, killing 12 children. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) also reported on the attack, stating that 12 people, including children, were killed.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)) reported at least 12 deaths and 30 injuries. Israel accused Hezbollah, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. <image:25>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of children in strawberry fields. One image is from [thekitchn.com](https://www.thekitchn.com/strawberry-picking-with-kids-267547) <image:8521>. Another image is from [istockphoto.com](https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/child-strawberry-picking) <image:8522>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulted in the death of children. However, the image search results show images of children in strawberry fields, which contrasts with the context of the rocket attack.

The claim states that the image shows the youngest victim of the attack. There is no information in the provided evidence to support this. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, information is needed to connect the image to the victims of the rocket attack. This would require identifying the child in the image and confirming their death in the attack.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)) reported at least 12 deaths and 30 injuries. Israel accused Hezbollah, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. <image:25>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of children in strawberry fields. One image is from [thekitchn.com](https://www.thekitchn.com/strawberry-picking-with-kids-267547) <image:8521>. Another image is from [istockphoto.com](https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/child-strawberry-picking) <image:8522>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, resulted in the death of children. However, the image search results show images of children in strawberry fields, which contrasts with the context of the rocket attack.

The claim states that the image shows the youngest victim of the attack. There is no information in the provided evidence to support this. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, information is needed to connect the image to the victims of the rocket attack. This would require identifying the child in the image and confirming their death in the attack.

> **Claim:** Photo showing China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games, which was inspired by the Palestinian flag.
> 
> **Fact:** This viral photo was featured in a 2023 issue of Vogue China magazine and does not show China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games. China’s uniform for the Paris Olympics features red and white colors. According to reports, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed support for Palestinians on several occasions, pledging additional humanitarian aid to Gaza and condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories ([here](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-asks-world-court-speak-out-unlawful-israeli-occupation-2024-02-22/)

To sum up, an old photo from Vogue China magazine is being falsely shared as showing Chinese athletes wearing the colours of the Palestinian flag.

[!Factly <image:8603>](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va1Lh751SWssBut3q81s)

Share. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games feature 329 events in 32 sports. From this, it is clear that the photo has no connection with Palestine or the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The comments came during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where Trump aired a long list of complaints about a wide range of issues, ranging from President Biden's new ban on offshore drilling, to his various legal cases, to the Panama Canal.

Negotiations between Hamas and Israel are ongoing in Qatar, with Hamas this week [naming 34 hostages](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/g-s1-41220/israel-hamas-hostage-negotiations)
 in Gaza — including two dual U.S. citizens — it would be willing to release in a ceasefire deal.

Steve Witcoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, joined Trump briefly and told reporters that "we're making a lot of progress" in trying to free hostages held by Hamas, and that he was "really hopeful that by the inaugural we'll have some good things to announce."

Trump would not elaborate on what he meant by his threat — first announced [on social media in early December](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113584730902816413)
 — that "all hell will break out" if a deal is not made.

"It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone," Trump said.

![U.S. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Tuesday, adding that “there should have never been” the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.

Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, struck an optimistic note about the state of negotiations to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would secure the release of the hostages, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress.”

“It’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,” Witkoff added. January 7, 2025.

U.S. January 7, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. CNN has previously reported that Biden administration officials are taking the lead in the talks, while their incoming Trump counterparts are being closely updated on developments.

But a senior Biden administration official struck a much more cautious tone following Trump and Witkoff’s comments, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.”

The official – who declined to comment further on the status of the talks – insisted that despite Witkoff appearing to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic, the talks are challenging. The first ceasefire – weeks after the October 7 attack – saw the release of dozens of hostages, but subsequent efforts to pause the fighting and secure the release of additional hostages have gone nowhere.

Witkoff told reporters he expected to travel back to Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday."

Content: "The assault was launched after Hamas fighters stormed Israeli territory in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israeli military strikes killed at least 24 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said, as the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory urged international donors to immediately provide fuel to run generators and maintain medical services.

One of those strikes killed four people in a house in Gaza City and six were killed in separate strikes across the enclave, medics said.

Later on Tuesday, an Israeli strike on a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip killed four children and eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia in the north, medics said.

Additionally, an Israeli strike on a car in Khan Younis killed two people, medics and civil emergency service officials said.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those strikes.

It said [240 Palestinians](/world/middle-east/israel-detains-medics-after-hospital-raid-health-officials-say-2024-12-28/)
 its forces had detained in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza last month had provided "substantial intelligence".

The military released footage of the interrogation of a purported Hamas militant who detailed how militants "operated from the hospital area" and transferred weapons to and from it.

Hamas and the Gaza health ministry deny any armed presence at the hospital.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hamas stood by its demand on Tuesday that Israel fully end its assault on Gaza under any deal to release hostages, and said U.S. 20 inauguration.

Officials from the Islamist group and Israel have been holding talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in the most intensive effort for months to reach a ceasefire [in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)

The outgoing U.S. administration has called for a final push for a deal before Joe Biden leaves office, and many in the region now view [Trump's inauguration](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/)
 as an unofficial deadline.

But with the clock ticking, both sides accuse the other of blocking a deal by adhering to conditions that torpedoed all previous peace efforts for more than a year.

Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw all its troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office did not comment.

In one notable step towards a deal, a Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday the group had [cleared a list](/world/middle-east/blinken-calls-push-get-gaza-truce-deal-over-finish-line-2025-01-06/)
 submitted by Israel of 34 hostages who could be freed in the initial phase of a truce, alongside Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

The list included female Israeli soldiers, plus elderly, female and minor-aged civilians. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

**\[1/3\]**A woman walks past posters of hostages kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, December 16, 2024. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are free.

"Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of the hostages," the director general of Israel's foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, told a briefing with reporters, saying Israel was fully committed to reaching a deal.

Hamas official Osama Hamdan, who held a news conference in Algiers, said Israel was to blame for undermining all efforts to reach a deal.

While he said he would not give details about the latest round of negotiations, he reiterated the Hamas conditions of "a complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded".

Commenting on Trump's threat that there would be "hell to pay" unless all hostages were freed before the inauguration, Hamdan said: "I think the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was rash to say there would be "hell to pay" unless they go free by his Jan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had so far received no confirmation about whether those on its list were still alive.

Content: "Except courage, courage is made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — André Fran (@andrefran) [October 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/andrefran/status/1716203264440467498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While it's entirely possible that Bourdain might have agreed with the words in the quote, we have so far been unable to find any credible record of him ever having made this exact statement.

Bourdain [died by suicide](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-asia-argento-last-texts-down-and-out-in-paradise-excerpt/)
 in June 2018 in France, reportedly [hanging himself](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-death-no-evidence-foul-play-violence-report/)
 in his hotel room. We'll also take a look back at the fact that Bourdain had visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for an episode of his CNN show, which resulted in several noteworthy comments and tweets he made in regard to Palestinians.

A Quote Misattributed
---------------------

The oldest version of the quote that we could find with Bourdain's name attached to it was from July 2021.

> “Today nearly everything is made in China-except for courage, it’s made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain

> — Rama Al Malah (@MalahRama) [July 25, 2021](https://twitter.com/MalahRama/status/1419149132053221381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Meanwhile, we found similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, showing that his name had been misattributed with the quote.

> "Today nearly everything is made in China...except for courage- it's made in Palestine." [pic.twitter.com/zdnMsjEH4g](https://t.co/zdnMsjEH4g)

The episode included several key moments of narration from Bourdain that helped to shed light on what his thoughts _might_ be if he were still alive and asked about the "courage is made in Palestine" quote.

During the episode, upon entering a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, Bourdain referred to the territory as being "a prison":

!Anthony Bourdain was purported to have said the words today nearly everything is made in China except for courage which is made in Palestine. However, as we've noted below, Bourdain did have a record of making several remarks on the subject of Israel and Gaza, including comments and tweets specifically about Palestinians.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last Friday, a photographer captured President Joe Biden leaving a Nantucket, Mass., bookstore holding a copy of _The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine_, a controversial book by the Palestinian-American historian Rashid Khalidi, an anti-Israel academic who recently retired from Columbia University. 

The Black Friday purchase drew immediate ire from pro-Israel advocates certain that Biden was either trying to telegraph a political shift or to reflect his true beliefs — something akin to Khalidi’s perspective that Israel is a racist, apartheid state committing genocide in Gaza. 

But the image of Biden holding the book sparked fury among anti-Israel activists as well. In a post on the social media site X, Khalidi’s son, Ismail, [weighed in](https://x.com/IsmailKhalidi/status/1862659766427820535)
: “Hey @JoeBiden, get my father’s book out of your blood soaked hands, you genocidal maniac.” 

Khalidi did not seem pleased, either. Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Washington bureau chief of the Saudi-owned network Al Arabiya, [described the book](https://x.com/nadia_bilbassy/status/1862692585937977451)
 as “the most famous book narrating the Palestinian Nakkba,” referring to the Arabic word for “catastrophe,” which many Arabs use to describe the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 during which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were displaced.

A Nantucket Bookworks employee who answered the phone on Monday declined to say if Biden picked up the book himself or if someone — a family member, an employee or someone else — suggested it to him. “My reaction is that this is four years too late,” he told [_The New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)
. 

What’s not clear is how the book found its way into the hands of Biden, who has often described himself as a Zionist. The book is now out of stock at the bookstore, according to another employee reached by phone.

With Biden in the store were First Lady Jill Biden; their daughter Ashley; and their son Hunter, his wife Melissa Cohen Biden and their son, Beau.

John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, said Biden’s purchase of the book reflects only an interest in reading and learning about history. 

“It doesn’t surprise me that he would go into a bookstore and get a book of history, particularly about the Middle East, to try to keep learning. He really does believe in speaking, learning and thinking broadly, and that’s what that tells me,” Kirby [told reporters](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/white-house-defends-bidens-purchase-of-book-that-presents-zionism-as-a-settler-colonialist-enterprise/)
 on Monday, noting that he had not spoken to Biden about the purchase. 

A White House spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment about why Biden picked up the book. 

Displays of books about Palestinian history have become commonplace at bookstores, particularly those in liberal communities, after the Oct. Described as a “history of settler colonialism and resistance from 1917 to 2017,” Khalidi’s book spent 39 weeks on the bestseller list after last Oct. The final days of the 2008 presidential campaign saw Barack Obama [face scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/nyregion/31khalil.html)
 for his ties to Khalidi, with whom he had once been close when they both lived in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood. 

A [_Los Angeles Times_ story](https://www.latimes.com/la-na-obamamideast10-2008april10-story.html)
 that year spotlighted Obama’s friendship with Khalidi, reporting that at Khalidi’s 2003 goodbye party as he prepared to move to New York, Obama offered a toast: His dinners with the scholar had provided “consistent reminders to me of my own blind spots and my own biases,” Obama said, and he pledged to “continue that conversation, a conversation that is necessary not just around Mona and Rashid’s dinner table … \[but around\] this entire world.”

[President Biden](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden)
 on Friday picked up a copy of a book that described Israel as a colonial power in the face of Palestinian resistance despite his repeated support for the Jewish state. 

Biden was spotted by the press leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, the New York Post reported. 

"I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late," Khalidi told the Post of Biden holding his book. 

The newspaper noted it did not agree to any terms conditioning [Khalidi's response](https://www.foxnews.com/media)
 as off the record or on background.

In the book, Khalidi wrote about Israel's alleged discriminatory policies against Palestinians.

"Settler-colonial confrontations with indigenous peoples have only ended in one of three ways: with the elimination of full subjugation of the native population, as in North America; with the defeat and expulsion of the colonizer, as in Algeria, which is extremely rare; or with the abandonment of colonial supremacy, in the context of compromise and reconciliation, as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ireland," he wrote.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Khalidi and the White House.

The [book argues](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/hundred-years-war-on-palestine/)
 that "the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will." 

It was not clear if Biden purchased the book or if it was given to him. 

Khalidi, who is of Palestinian and Lebanese descent, called the first Trump administration a "mouthpiece" [for Israel](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel)
 and has criticized Israel over the humanitarian toll in Gaza after Hamas killed about 1,200 people inside Israel Oct. But what their political objective is, is, to me, entirely unclear, in the writings of, as far as one can tell, from the Israeli press," he said on the "Intercepted" podcast in November 2023.

He also praised the [first intifada](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/defense/wars)
 by Palestinians against Israel, which occurred from 1987 to 1993 and left more than 2,000 people dead, the Post wrote. 

"The First Intifada was an outstanding example of popular resistance against oppression and can be considered as being the first unmitigated victory for the Palestinians in the long colonial war that began in 1917," the book says.

Israel ''did an illegal act by kidnapping us,'' says Greta Thunberg

Israel says it has deported Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, a day after the Gaza-bound aid boat she and 11 other people were on was intercepted by Israeli forces in the Mediterranean.

Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning on a flight to France after she agreed to be deported, the Israeli foreign ministry said.

Upon arriving at an airport in Paris, Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and other activists on the boat while they were in international waters.

France said five of the six French citizens detained alongside her had refused to sign their deportation orders and would now be subject to judicial proceedings.

Thunberg arrives in Paris

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), the activist group operating the yacht The Madleen, has demanded the immediate release of everyone detained.

The vessel was intercepted early on Monday while the activists tried to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's maritime blockade and highlight the humanitarian crisis there.

The Israeli foreign ministry dismissed it as a "selfie yacht", and announced in a post on X on Monday night that the passengers had been transferred to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport following the vessel's arrival at the port of Ashdod on Monday night.

"Those who refuse to sign deportation documents and leave Israel will be brought before a judicial authority, in accordance with Israeli law, to authorize their deportation," it said.

On Tuesday morning, the ministry said Thunberg had "just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden (via France)", and [posted a photo of her sitting on a plane](https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1932337642886021543)
.

Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport, Thunberg said Israel had committed "an illegal act by kidnapping us on international waters and against our will, bringing us to Israel, keeping us in the bottom of the boat, not letting us getting out and so on".

She added: "But that is not the real story here, the real story is that there is a genocide going on in Gaza, and a systematic starvation following the siege and blockade now, which is leading to food, medicine, water - that are desperately needed to get into Gaza - is prevented from doing so."

The Israeli foreign ministry has insisted the blockade was "consistent with international law", and that unauthorised attempts to breach it were "dangerous, unlawful, and undermine ongoing humanitarian efforts".

Asked why she was free while others were still detained, Thunberg said it was "a bit unclear". Their kidnapping is unlawful and a violation of international law," it added.

Israel's foreign ministry said the aid, which includes baby formula and medicine, would be transferred to Gaza "through real humanitarian channels".

The FFC said the Madleen was intercepted by the Israeli military inside international waters about 185km (115 miles) west of Gaza early on Monday.

According to the group, the vessel was surrounded by quadcopter drones, sprayed with a "white irritant substance", and had its communications jammed.

Video footage released by the group showed the passengers sitting down with their hands raised as Israeli forces boarded.

It also posted [a pre-recorded clip showing Thunberg saying](https://x.com/GazaFFlotilla/status/1931886800634818871)
: "If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupational forces or forces that support Israel."

"I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible."

The foreign ministry later said all the passengers were "safe and unharmed", and posted a video showing troops handing them food and water.

! "I'm very worried about them," she said.

France's Foreign Minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, earlier wrote on X: "Our consul was able to see the six French nationals arrested by the Israeli authorities last night."

"One of them has agreed to leave voluntarily and should return today. It left the Italian city of Catania on 1 June and was intercepted by Israeli forces on 9 June, near the Ashdod port. <image:8620>

When the Madleen set sail from Italy on 1 June, the FFC said it was "carrying humanitarian aid and international human rights defenders in direct defiance of Israel's illegal and genocidal blockade". The Israeli foreign ministry called it a "gimmick", while Israel has rejected accusations of genocide.

On Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the maritime blockade was necessary to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hamas.

Israel and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza when Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections.

Israel stopped all deliveries of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March this year and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.

It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the group to release the hostages still held in Gaza, but the UN warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population were facing catastrophic levels of hunger because of the resulting shortages of food.

Three weeks ago, Israel launched an expanded offensive to take control of all areas of Gaza. It also partially eased the blockade, allowing in a "basic" amount of food.

Israel is now prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which it backs along with the US. The UN and other aid groups are refusing to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It is 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,927 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel deports Greta Thunberg after seizing of Gaza-bound ship
==============================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jun 10, 2025 1:52 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel deported activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday, a day after the Gaza-bound ship she was on was seized by the Israeli military.

Speaking upon arrival in Paris en route to her home country of Sweden, Thunberg called for the release of the other activists who were detained aboard the Freedom Flotilla. The activists were held separately and some had trouble accessing lawyers, she added.

Asked why she agreed to deportation, she said, “Why would I want to stay in an Israeli prison more than necessary?”

Thunberg called on supporters to ask their governments “to demand not only humanitarian aid being let into Gaza but most importantly an end to the occupation and an end to the systemic oppression and violence that Palestinians are facing on an everyday basis.”

She said recognizing Palestine is “the very, very, very minimum” that governments can do to help.

Thunberg was one of 12 passengers on the Madleen. Israel rejects that charge, saying such ships intend to breach what it argues is a lawful naval blockade of Gaza.

Israel viewed the ship as a publicity stunt, calling it the “selfie yacht” with a “meager” amount of aid that amounted to less than a truckload.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. The trip was meant to protest Israeli restrictions on aid to Gaza’s population of over 2 million people after 20 months of war, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the group behind the journey.

### Other activists face deportation

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said three activists, including Thunberg, had been deported along with a journalist. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters.

President Donald Trump called Thunberg “a young angry person” and recommended she take anger management classes.

“I think the world need a lot more young angry women,” Thunberg said Tuesday in response.

Thunberg said it appeared she was headed back to Sweden, hadn’t had access to a phone in a few days and wanted a shower. Israeli naval forces seized the boat without incident early Monday about 200 kilometers (125 miles) off Gaza.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, along with rights groups, said Israel’s actions in international waters were a violation of international law. It said it had encouraged some to do it so they could speak freely about their experiences.

Eight other passengers refused deportation and were in detention before their case is heard by Israeli authorities."

‘We did nothing wrong’: Greta Thunberg accuses Israel of kidnapping yacht crew
==============================================================================

This article is more than 2 months old

Swedish activist says ‘12 peaceful volunteers’ did not break laws during attempt to bring symbolic aid shipment to Gaza

Hours after being deported from Israel, [Greta Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg)
 accused the country of kidnapping her and her fellow activists in international waters, adding that she had refused to sign a document stating that she had entered Israel illegally.

Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the Swedish campaigner stressed that she and others on a [Gaza-bound ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/gaza-aid-boat-activists-greta-thunberg-israel-deportation)
 intercepted by Israel on Monday had simply been attempting to bring much-needed aid to the war-torn territory.

“We were 12 peaceful volunteers sailing on a civilian ship carrying humanitarian aid on international waters,” Thunberg said. We did nothing wrong.”

The UK-flagged Madleen vessel was [seized by Israeli authorities](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/gaza-aid-boat-madleen-israel-greta-thunberg-freedom-flotilla-coalition)
 on Monday about 125 miles (200km) off the coast of Gaza, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the voyage. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters after arriving in Barcelona.

Amnesty International also weighed in, with the organisation’s secretary general noting that the interception of the Madleen in international waters “violates international law”. Israel’s military declined to comment.

In 2010, [nine activists were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israel-kills-activists-flotilla-gaza)
 when Israeli commandos raided a small fleet of ships trying to ferry supplies, including building materials, to Gaza.

Thunberg said she hadn’t been able to say goodbye to the rest of the crew, and that it was “unclear” why she had been deported while other crew members remained detained.

Adalah, a legal rights group in Israel representing several of the crew members, said eight other passengers had refused deportation and were being held in detention as they waited for their cases to be heard by Israeli authorities

The crew had previously been disparaged by Israeli officials, with the foreign ministry labelling the vessel as the “selfie yacht” when it announced its seizure.

On Tuesday, officials shared photos of Thunberg, a climate activist who has [long shunned air travel](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly)
, being boarded on to a flight to France.

Speaking after her arrival in Paris, Thunberg said the Gaza-bound ship had been a response to what she described as the “systematic starvation of over 2 million people and the full-blown, livestream genocide”.

While aid was critically needed in Gaza, the voyage had also been driven by a broader aim, she said. That’s the thing we need the most of.”

.

Thunberg, 22, said on Tuesday that the conditions the crew had faced were “absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now”, but said she was “very worried” about her fellow crew members and called for their immediate release.

“I was very clear in my testimony that we were kidnapped on international waters and brought against our own will into [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
,” she said. Some remain in Israel, where they will face deportation hearings.

The ship had been attempting to bring a symbolic shipment of aid to Gaza, which has been pushed [to the brink of famine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/food-security-experts-warn-gaza-critical-risk-famine-israeli-blockade)

 while trying to collect food from the handful of sites run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are secured by armed guards and under the protection of the Israeli military. “This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing.”

The stance was echoed by Sergio Toribio, a fellow crew member who was deported to Spain on Tuesday. In a statement, Agnès Callamard added: “The crew were unarmed activists and human rights defenders on a humanitarian mission, they must be released immediately and unconditionally.”

Since Israel imposed a naval blockade on Gaza in 2007, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have made several attempts to carry aid to Gaza.

In May, one of their Gaza-bound ships [was damaged](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta)
 in international waters off Malta, with crew members issuing an SOS after what they described as an attack by Israeli drones. “Also to send solidarity and say that we see you, we see what is happening and we cannot accept just witnessing all this and doing nothing.”

Thunberg, who said it appeared she was now heading back to Sweden, also hit back at Donald Trump after she was asked about his characterisation of her as an “angry person” and suggestion that she should take anger management classes.

“I think the world needs many more young angry women, to be honest,” said Thunberg."

From [Source](https://www.bnaibrith.org/greta-thunberg-activism-discredited-after-shocking-anti-israel-chants/): 
Content: "Mariaschin have issued the following statement:** 

One month after a social media post expressing solidarity with people in Gaza but not Israel following the most gruesome atrocities targeting Jews since the Holocaust, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has escalated inflammatory rhetoric on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Thunberg’s social media posts, accompanied by hashtags including “#StandWithPalestine,” also repeatedly feature Jews signaling support for Palestinians but no Muslims, Arabs or others affirming Israelis’ right to existence and equality.

After her initial Oct. 20 post, our United Nations and Intercommunal Affairs Director David Michaels wrote in an op-ed in DC Journal and the Boston Herald that the 20-year-old activist delivered a “grave betrayal” to numerous “allies and supporters among Israeli and other Jews who have repeatedly been not just terrorized and traumatized but dehumanized, marginalized, maligned and abandoned.”

He continued, Thunberg’s stunning callousness “has signaled that there is literally nothing Israel’s attackers can do to inspire equal care for the legitimate rights and very lives of Israelis.” 

Hamas has continued to perpetrate carnage from the Gaza Strip—a territory from which Israel withdrew completely and unilaterally in 2005.

No one, let alone a public figure with outsize influence on young people worldwide, should be permitted to incite violent hatred. As long as she promotes bigotry, Greta Thunberg should be shunned by world leaders and all those committed to peace and genuine coexistence.

As Greta Thunberg Chants “Crush Zionism” After Anti-Jewish Pogroms, B’nai B’rith Calls Her Activism Discredited
===============================================================================================================

November 27, 2023

**B’nai B’rith President Seth J. 23.

Zionism means nothing more than support for Israel’s right to exist—and Thunberg’s chanting of a shocking slogan more identified with genocidal forces in the Middle East discredits her as a legitimate interlocutor in the international community. 

Five of Thunberg’s eight Instagram posts since Hamas terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7—murdering some 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostage, overwhelmingly civilians, while firing thousands of rockets at Israelis from among Palestinians in Gaza—have included signage singling out the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and only the cause of a “free Palestine,” for amplification. 

Hamas, a jihadist group with an explicitly anti-Semitic charter, is openly committed to Israel’s destruction."

# Your Summary

At demonstrations, she calls to "Free Palestine," stop arming Israel and impose a permanent ceasefire on the country. Three weeks following the massacre, the Swedish activist stood alongside anti-Israel placards declaring, "Free Palestine," and, "Stop the Holocaust," and she herself held a sign reading, "Justice for Palestine."

> Many argue that Thunberg’s political stance is damaging the crucial fight against climate change

Criticism of Thunberg has also emerged on the global stage with Fridays for Future (FFF) leaders in Germany, Austria, and even in her homeland of Sweden, distancing themselves from her October 20 post featuring signs supporting the Palestinians, while ignoring the Hamas massacre. Report us")

Greta Thunberg brought millions out onto the world’s streets to protest for a greener future. She rarely, if ever, demands the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza or condemns the terrorist attack that triggered the war.

Demonstrating against Israel being her first priority, Thunberg didn’t even bother attending either the 2023 climate conference held in Dubai or that of 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan. The climate activist has turned her back on her supporters, and alongside her relentless anti-Israel campaigning, has also sparked anger in other arenas.

Thunberg visited Turkey’s Kurdish regions last November, evoking outrage in the country for condemning Erdogan’s government. For a sustainable peace and a just future, the Kurds’ right to freedom and autonomy must be respected and the violent attacks against Kurdistan must end."

After causing ire in Turkey, she moved on to voice her support for independence for Western Sahara, provoking fury in Morocco. She’s also condemned the Azerbaijani government, accusing it of "ethnic cleansing" and further crimes against Armenians, and has protested against Georgia’s government, advocating "Justice, freedom and democracy," amid the country’s political crisis.

And if you’d thought Thunberg had given up on her anti-Israel activism, you’d be wrong. Last month, she returned to Denmark, where she took part in a violent protest against the Maersk shipping company.

Along with further anti-Israel activists, Thunberg disrupted activity at the company’s headquarters, claiming it was using its ships to transport weapons to Israel. She called on the company to cancel all contracts and investments related to what she termed "Genocide and occupation of Palestine." Thunberg was arrested along with around two dozen more protesters who were all released shortly thereafter.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y264x3nnno](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y264x3nnno)), PBS News ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-deports-greta-thunberg-after-seizing-of-gaza-bound-ship](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-deports-greta-thunberg-after-seizing-of-gaza-bound-ship)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza)) all reported on June 10, 2025, that Greta Thunberg was deported by Israel after her Gaza-bound aid boat was intercepted. Thunberg accused Israel of kidnapping her and other activists.

The articles include images of Thunberg at the airport (<image:8618>, <image:8621>, <image:8626>), a map of the ship's journey (<image:8620>), the ship being intercepted (<image:8627>), and Thunberg on a plane (<image:8624>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments. The Telegraph published a video of her saying "f--- Israel" at a demonstration. Additionally, multiple news sources reported on her deportation from Israel after her Gaza-bound aid ship was intercepted, and she accused Israel of kidnapping her and other activists. However, the provided evidence does not directly verify the authenticity of the image in the claim. The image's authenticity cannot be confirmed or denied based on the available information.

Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg (Reuters)

Climate activist [Greta Thunberg](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/greta-thunberg)
 has ignited a storm of backlash after making inflammatory comments during an anti-Israel rally in Mannheim, Germany, on Friday. Thunberg, 21, was captured on video saying “f\*\*k Germany” and “f\*\*k Israel,” prompting cheers and applause from the crowd. 

  

“Someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving climate challenges,” the group added, highlighting the perceived contradiction in her stance. 
Critics from pro-Israel communities expressed their outrage online, with some questioning Thunberg’s relevance and calling her rhetoric “nasty” and divisive. She also drew criticism for sharing a photo with a toy octopus alongside a pro-Gaza sign after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

*   [Who will win the battle to become Indian households’ No. While the event remained peaceful, the comments made by Thunberg quickly went viral, sparking criticism across social media and political circles. 
Manuel Hagel, a conservative leader in Germany’s Baden-Württemberg regional parliament, condemned Thunberg’s remarks, describing them as “dehumanizing” and calling her presence “unnecessary.” Advocacy group StopAntisemitism also weighed in, labeling the young activist a “Hamas shill” in a widely circulated post on X (formerly Twitter). 
This isn’t the first time Thunberg has faced allegations of antisemitism. In September, she was arrested at a Copenhagen rally organized by Students Against the Occupation, a group protesting academic ties with Israel."

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:1606>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

CNN  — 

Former President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.

The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid has the details.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/video-blanche-maxwell-split-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

Harris, Trump condemn pro-Hamas protest near US Capitol

Print

The two leading U.S. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024.

In her statement, Harris concluded, "I support the right to peacefully protest, but let's be clear: Antisemitism, hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation."

In the first days of her presidential campaign against Republican Trump, Harris held a campaign rally with a teachers' union in the southwestern state of Texas on Thursday before flying to Washington to meet with Netanyahu at the White House. You had a horrible invasion that took place that would have never happened if I was president."

After Wednesday's protests, Trump called for Israel to quickly end the war and said the country was "not good" at promoting its cause in world affairs.

"You got to get it done quickly," Trump told Fox News.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on Thursday condemned the most visible of the pro-Hamas protests against Israel that erupted the day before near the U.S. flag.

On his Truth Social media platform, Trump said "If those people rioting in Washington yesterday were Republicans/Conservatives, they'd all be in jail right now, facing 10- to 20-year sentences. President Joe Biden meeting's with Netanyahu in Washington, July 25, 2024. Capitol.

The protests came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was defiantly defending his country's war against the Hamas militants in an address to Congress.

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee in the 2024 election, said in a statement, "We saw despicable acts by unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric" at Union Station, Washington's train depot not far from the Capitol.

In the plaza in front of the rail station, demonstrators replaced American flags with Palestinian flags, and a man climbed up to the middle of a fountain and used red spray paint to write "Hamas is comin'" in big letters. officials, condemned the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.

But as the months of fighting have raged on, and Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza targeting Hamas fighters killed more Palestinian civilians, especially thousands of women and children, Harris became more outspoken, initially blunter than Biden, about the need to end the conflict.

In March, she called for an "immediate" pause in fighting, contending that Israel had not done enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" among Palestinians in Gaza.

"People in Gaza are starving," she said. That's who Kamala Harris is."

Trump, after remaining mostly silent about the Israel-Hamas war, in March told Israel it has "to finish the problem."

In Capitol address, Israeli leader calls for U.S. Capitol on July 24, 2024 in Washington, D.C. Capitol on July 24, 2024 in Washington, D.C. “Ladies and gentlemen, that victory is in sight.”

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Additionally, [news](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-declares-two-more-gaza-hostages-dead-2024-07-22/)

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

The Senate’s president pro tempore, Patty Murray of Washington, also did not preside, citing opposition to the war in a statement [reported](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jul/23/patty-murray-will-skip-israeli-prime-ministers-add/)

    [\[344\]](#cite_note-Dunn-2024-345)
     In less than a day, a tweet revealing Crooks's appearance in the advertisement video was viewed more than 17 million times.[\[344\]](#cite_note-Dunn-2024-345)
     The video was then removed by the company.[\[345\]](#cite_note-346)
     The conspiracy theory that some people had foreknowledge is based on the fact that on July 12, 2024, one day before the assassination attempt, the investment company Austin Private Wealth filed a report with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "Securities and Exchange Commission")
     indicating that it had [shorted](/wiki/Shorted "Shorted")
     12 million shares of [Trump Media & Technology Group](/wiki/Trump_Media_%26_Technology_Group "Trump Media & Technology Group")
     (ticker symbol DJT), thus betting that the value of the stock would decrease.[\[346\]](#cite_note-Frank_Chung-2024-347)
     Four days later, the filing was amended to 1,200 shares, and the company apologized for what it asserted was a "filing error".[\[346\]](#cite_note-Frank_Chung-2024-347)
    

In an interview with [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")
 on April 9, 2025, former Secret Service special agent Richard Staropoli stated that he believed that the assassination attempt, as well as [the one in Florida two months later](/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Florida "Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida")

Two people who were shot during Saturday’s Donald Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and who are now stable were identified Sunday by state police.

Pennsylvania State Police identified David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, in a Sunday [press release](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/psp/newsroom/pennsylvania-state-police-identify-victims-shot-during-attempted.html)
.

The state police also confirmed the name of [Corey Comperatore](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/corey-comperatore-trump-shooting-victim/index.html)
, 50, as the victim who was killed in the assassination attempt. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself.

President Joe Biden urged people not to make assumptions and to “let the FBI do their job” in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

Biden, who spoke from the White House on Sunday, stood with Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas.

He stressed that we “don’t yet have any information about the motive of the shooter,” but that we “know who he is.”

He said he had instructed the investigation, which he said is in its early stages, to be “thorough and swift” and said the “investigators will have every resource they need to get this done.”

President Joe Biden speaks in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on July 13.

Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

President Joe Biden is speaking from the White House on Sunday following the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

The remarks this afternoon mark the second time Biden has spoken since the Saturday rally. He later told CNN that he is not aware of Trump’s “specific schedule” for the week.

Though Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.

In the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, Schimming said he remains “very, very confident” in the security preparations around the convention.

He said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding that “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”

A law enforcement source familiar with planning for the [Republican Nation Convention](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/politics/rnc-milwaukee-trump-full-list-speakers/index.html)
 told CNN on Sunday there are discussions underway about adding more federal law enforcement agents to post positions in light of the recent shooting. 

However, the [perimeter](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/22/politics/secret-service-rnc-security-perimeter/index.html)
 is unlikely to change, the source said, noting preparations for the RNC have been underway for a year and a half. 

The source added that there have been discussions about adding additional security for high-profile GOP members as well. 

The source said events, such as dinners, may be hard to police as they are outside the perimeter associated with the RNC and do not have the same level of security.

The source noted this concern had also been discussed before Saturday’s shooting.

The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false, as indicated by the Politifact fact-check. `false`

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on Truth Social.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified because the specific quote attributed to Trump is not found in the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
web_search("Donald Trump Truth Social July 25 2024 \"I hope that America obliterates Israel\"")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) states that on October 15, 2024, an Instagram post claimed that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I hope that America obliterates Israel.” Politifact rated this claim as false. The article also mentions other posts by Trump on Truth Social, including one on May 10, 2024, where he stated, "Biden wants to immediately stop all aid to Israel." <image:1>, <image:5352>, <image:5354>, <image:5357>, <image:5355>. The article was published on October 15, 2024.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a claim, similar to the one in the original claim, was fact-checked by Politifact and found to be false. The Politifact article, published on October 15, 2024, addressed an Instagram post that attributed the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel" to Donald Trump on Truth Social. This directly contradicts the original claim.

**Verdict:** The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false, as indicated by the Politifact fact-check. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. A Politifact article ([https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/oct/15/instagram-posts/trump-urged-revenge-against-iran-not-israel-in-res/)) from October 15, 2024, fact-checked a similar claim and found it to be false.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

Gaza: Baby pulled alive from rubble after Israeli air strike on Rafah
=====================================================================

Rescuers in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza, have pulled a baby girl alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike.

People used their hands to free Mariam Abu Akel from the debris, before a rescuer ran with her to a nearby hospital.

Doctors there swabbed her cuts.

The baby had been sheltering in a house with her family when the strike took place, which killed her mother and sister, Reuters reported. Her father and young brother survived.

The air strike killed 20 people and injured 55, according to a Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson.

More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Thousands more are believed to be still under rubble of buildings destroyed by air and artillery strikes.

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and taking about 240 hostages.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it."

## Actions
```
web_search("children found rubble home Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("children found rubble home")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old girl whose parents and brother were killed (<image:6472>). The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, which killed her mother and sister (<image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>). Democracy Now! reported on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed nine children, with emergency workers pulling charred bodies from the rubble (<image:6505>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video)) <image:8753>

The UN News provides an image of a teddy bear in the rubble. ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042](https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042)) <image:8754>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that children have been found in the rubble of homes in Gaza, which aligns with the claim's general context. However, the specific details of the claim, including the date and cause of death, are not confirmed. The geolocation analysis supports the image's association with Palestine, but it does not provide definitive proof of the claim's accuracy.

Omar Ashtawy APA images

Among the Palestinians killed in the West Bank during April was a man who was shot after a raid on his house in the Old City of Nablus, during which his brother was arrested, according to OCHA.

That same day, 2 April, Israeli troops [shot and killed](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin_omar_zioud)
 Omar Amer Zyoud, a 16-year-old who was reportedly among a group that threw incendiary objects at military jeeps at the entrance to Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man after he allegedly threw stones at Israeli vehicles in the Bethlehem area of the southern West Bank on 3 April and confiscated his body.

A man was killed by Israeli troops searching his house when they shot at him while he was attempting to flee in his vehicle in Jenin on 4 April.

Palestinians, mostly children, receive a warm meal distributed by charitable organizations in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, 26 April. 

Omar Ashtawy APA images

On 6 April, Israeli forces [shot and killed](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/israel-kills-children-routinely-west-bank)
 Amer Rabee, a 14-year-old Palestinian American, at the entrance to Turmusayya, a town north of Ramallah in the central West Bank.

The Israeli military [claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-teenager-with-us-citizenship-shot-dead-by-israeli-settler-2025-04-06/)
 it had opened fire toward “terrorists” who had “hurled rocks” towards a highway.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_14_year_old_palestinian_american_boy_near_ramallah)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Amer and two other children “were picking green almonds on the agricultural land adjacent to Route 60, when Israeli soldiers started shooting at the children from a distance of about 20 meters (66 feet) away.”

“Amer was shot in the head and immediately collapsed,” the rights group added.

DCIP said that Israeli forces withheld the boy’s body, which was found to have sustained 13 bullet wounds, for around five hours. <image:8806>

Children search for salvageable items in a garbage dump that sprawls across what used to be the Firas market in Gaza City, 11 April.

On 11 April, the UN human rights office [warned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2025/04/gaza-increasing-israeli-evacuation-orders-lead-forcible-transfer)
 that “Israel appears to be inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group.”

The UN office said that “the nature and scope” of evacuation orders displacing Palestinians in Gaza “raise serious concerns that Israel intends permanently to remove the civilian population from these areas in order to create a ‘buffer zone.’”

“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute,” the UN human rights office added.

Also during the month of April, the World Food Program reported that around 700,000 Palestinians in the West Bank “needed food assistance in 2024, a nearly 100 percent increase compared with the period before October 2023,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [stated](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
.

On 19 April, the Israeli military announced that one of its officers was [killed](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-19/ty-article/israeli-officer-killed-in-gaza-combat-idf-says/00000196-4f4a-d9fb-a79f-6fca06ce0000)
 by an explosive device in northern Gaza – the army’s first fatality since it resumed its offensive on Gaza a month earlier.

, which marked Holy Saturday during Easter celebrations, Israeli forces erected dozens of temporary checkpoints in and around Jerusalem. <image:8845>

Children pose inside the destroyed Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, which is being used a shelter for displaced families, 22 April.

Also on 23 April, 10 people were [killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrikes-kill-10-school-housing-displaced-families-hit-childrens-2025-04-23/)
 in an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced families were sheltering in Gaza City.

At least 26 people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on 23 April. The boy died after nearly 20 hours in intensive care, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine, which [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_palestinian_child_with_expanding_bullet_in_jalazone_refugee_camp_raid)
 that the boy’s severe internal injuries were likely caused by expanding bullets.

These weapons have been prohibited under international law since 1868, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish, a program director with the rights group, “due to the extreme and unnecessary suffering they cause.”

“Yet, Israeli forces use these illegal weapons against Palestinian children with no consequences from the international community,” Eqtaish added.

At least five children have been killed by expanding bullets in the West Bank since 7 October 2023, according to DCIP.

Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including a child, in the West Bank [between 15 and 21 April](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
. Israel is withholding their bodies.

[According to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
 OCHA, the deadly incident “followed the announcement of the death of a Palestinian from the village in Israeli custody … three days before he was set to be released.”

Defense for Children International-Palestine [stated](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_fatally_shoot_confiscate_body_of_16_year_old_palestinian_boy)
 that Jihad Adeli was part of a group that was ambushed by troops.

On 20 April, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian near Homesh settlement in the northern West Bank after the man reportedly opened fire towards a checkpoint near the settlement, causing no casualties.

On 23 April, Israeli forces shot and killed Mahmoud al-Haija, 12, in a cemetery in al-Yamoun, a town near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

“Mahmoud, alongside other boys and young men, were allegedly throwing stones toward Israeli soldiers deployed around the cemetery while other soldiers raided a residential building nearby,” Defense for Children International-Palestine [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_12_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin)
 in an initial report.

On 25 April, Israeli soldiers hiding behind a tree shot and killed Abdulkhaleq Jabour, 16, while he was closing up the shop where he worked during a military incursion into Salem, a town east of Nablus.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_working_at_a_shop_near_nablus)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Israeli soldiers surrounded Abdulkhaleq for at least 10 minutes while two of his relatives attempted to render first aid.

Israeli forces have killed 24 Palestinian boys and girls in the West Bank since the beginning of the year, according to the children’s rights group.

In addition to the above, on 21 April, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack triggered by tear gas inhalation after he was assaulted by Israeli forces who accompanied settlers during a raid in the town of Sinjil near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

“During the incident, Israeli forces injured 17 other Palestinians, including four children, and Israeli settlers physically assaulted and injured three Palestinians,” according to OCHA.

Save the Children, a charity based in the UK, [said](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/about-130-children-born-daily-gaza-amid-total-siege-aid-and-goods)
 on 2 April that around 130 babies are being born daily in Gaza, where the health care system is on “the verge of collapse.”

“The survival of mothers and newborn children in Gaza is under particular threat due to the lack of food, destruction of hospitals and chronic stress,” the charity stated.

At least 287 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between 3 and 8 April alone, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-278-gaza-strip)
 the health ministry in the territory.

On 1 April, dozens of settlers broke into Duma village near Nablus in the northern West Bank and set fire to several vehicles, burned a chicken coop and sprayed graffiti on the walls of homes while raiding Israeli forces fired tear gas and live ammunition, injuring three people, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Palestinians in the West Bank are under increasing pressure from both settlers and the Israeli military.

On 6 April, Israeli forces demolished more than 33 structures, including 11 residential tents, and damaged water tanks and solar panels in Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, located in an area of the West Bank’s Jordan Valley that Israel has designated as a firing zone.

The mass demolition incident displaced 33 people, including 19 children – all of whom were previously displaced from another area of the Jordan Valley due to settler violence, according to OCHA. <image:8781>

Also on 6 April, the UN human rights office [stated](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/un-human-rights-office-opt-alarm-over-killings-and-unlawful-use-force-local-police-gaza-amidst-deteriorating-public-order-enar)
 that it was “alarmed by the breakdown of public order in Gaza, with recent allegations of killings and unnecessary or disproportionate use of force in crowd control by local police.”

The UN office added that Gaza’s governance and law enforcement structures have been dismantled and destroyed by Israel’s attacks, “contributing to a deterioration of public order that threatens the safety of Palestinians and their access to basic services and life-saving humanitarian aid.”

Also on 6 April, Hamas said it [fired rockets](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-fires-rockets-israeli-cities-2025-04-06/)
 from Gaza, with Israeli media reporting a direct strike in Ashkelon in southern Israel that lightly injured 12 people."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it."

## Actions
```
web_search("children found rubble home Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("children found rubble home")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old girl whose parents and brother were killed (<image:6472>). The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, which killed her mother and sister (<image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>). Democracy Now! reported on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed nine children, with emergency workers pulling charred bodies from the rubble (<image:6505>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2023/oct/19/gaza-moment-children-are-pulled-from-rubble-after-home-hit-by-israeli-airstrike-video)) <image:8753>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

© AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE | 2024 | Všetky práva vyhradené. An image that social media posts say shows a Palestinian child trapped under rubble, however, actually appeared online at least eight months before the Gaza war, triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas militants against Israel on October 7. May God have mercy on them,” commented another.

However, AFP found the image circulated online months before Hamas’ October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

**Image predates war**

A reverse search on [TinEye](https://perma.cc/LLV5-F8GJ)
 found the image has been shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The photo was shared by user on [X](https://perma.cc/7YHX-8864)
, formerly Twitter, on February 8 in response to a post about relief works in Syria and Turkey following a devastating [earthquake](https://perma.cc/MU4G-PSSL)
 on February 6 that killed more than 50,000 people.

A Google reverse image search found the same image had also been shared on [LinkedIn](https://perma.cc/L9XV-TPYA)
 in February 2023.

Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right):

The user on X who shared the image in February has not responded to AFP’s inquiry about its origin.

**Author(s):** AFP Bangladesh

**Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government. Long live, Long live Palestine”, reads the Bengali-language caption.

The post circulated after Hamas militants poured into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government.

A [truce agreement](https://perma.cc/M3X2-VPC8)
 that went into effect on November 24 has brought a temporary halt to seven weeks of fighting and saw dozens of Israeli hostages freed, with over 100 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in return.

! The image also bears visual irregularities that suggest it had been AI-generated, an expert told AFP.**

The image appearing to show a child trapped under concrete blocks was posted [here](https://perma.cc/6QFW-LYRP)
 on Facebook on October 19, 2023, and has since been shared more than 4,000 times.

“Just imagine it is your baby, how would you feel then! <image:8857>

Screenshot of the false post, taken on November 7, 2023

The image was shared alongside similar claims on Facebook [here](https://perma.cc/K7F4-BU92)
 and [here](https://perma.cc/N8H2-9QG5)
.

Comments from users suggested they believed it was genuine.

One wrote: “I feel like every bloodied Palestinian child is my child. <image:8858>

Screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right)

A visual communications expert told AFP it was “highly likely” the picture was generated with AI tools.

[Dr TJ Thomson](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/t/thomson-dr-t-j)
, a senior lecturer at Australia’s RMIT University School of Media and Communications, told AFP there were anomalies in the creases in the child’s forehead and chin, as well as the fingers on the child’s left hand.

An analysis of the image showed the child appears to have too many fingers, which are also deformed.

Despite the advancements in generative AI, errors still show up in AI-generated content."

The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, which killed her mother and sister (<image:6474>, <image:6478>, <image:6480>, <image:6484>, <image:6486>, <image:6488>, <image:6492>). Democracy Now! reported on May 27, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed nine children, with emergency workers pulling charred bodies from the rubble (<image:6505>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about children being pulled from the rubble in Turkey and Syria. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/2/8/hope-heartbreak-as-children-pulled-from-rubble-in-turkey-syria)) <image:8752> The Guardian published a video of children being pulled from the rubble after their home was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.

The UN News provides an image of a teddy bear in the rubble. ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042](https://news.un.org/en/story/2016/08/537042)) <image:8754>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found in the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date (April 2025) or the specific location. The image search results show that children have been pulled from the rubble in Gaza, but the evidence does not confirm the image's origin.

Therefore, the claim is not fully verifiable due to the lack of specific information about the image's origin and the exact circumstances.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the exact date or the cause of the children's death.


## Actions
```
web_search("image children found rubble Gaza April 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Electronic Intifada published an article about the situation in Gaza during April 2025, including images of children in the rubble (<image:8806>, <image:8839>, <image:8845>, <image:8777>, <image:8778>, <image:8780>, <image:8781>). The AFP fact-check debunks an image of a child trapped under rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation (<image:8856>, <image:8860>, <image:8857>, <image:8858>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the situation in Gaza during April 2025 included images of children in the rubble. However, the evidence also includes a fact-check that debunks an image of a child trapped under rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation. The claim's image is not among the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israel bombing Damascus February 2025")
geolocate(<image:41>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>).

The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

Israel strikes targets in southern Syria after demanding demilitarisation
=========================================================================

Military sites hit as Tel Aviv says it ‘will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon’

Israeli warplanes have carried out several airstrikes on military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria, as Israeli officials warned the country’s army not to move south of the capital city.

Israeli jets struck military sites late on Tuesday in the town of Kiswah, south of Damascus, as well as in the southern province of Deraa, local [Syrian media](https://www.syria.tv/%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%AF%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A9)
 reported.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, confirmed the strikes in southern [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 and warned that Israel “will not allow southern Syria to become southern Lebanon”.

Katz added that “any attempt by the Syrian regime forces and the country’s terrorist organisations to establish themselves in the security zone in southern Syria will be met with fire”.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanded the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria.

Shortly after a Syrian rebel offensive led by Islamist opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [toppled the Assad regime on 8 December](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syrians-celebrate-fall-of-bashar-al-assad-after-five-decades-of-dynastic-rule)
, Israeli forces entered the UN buffer zone between Israel and Syria. Israeli forces have remained there ever since, despite protests by Syria’s new government and the UN, which monitors the demilitarised zone between the two countries.

[Israel’s air force also carried out hundreds of airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/10/israel-strikes-hundreds-of-military-targets-in-syria)
 against weapons depots, naval bases and Syrian military infrastructure in the weeks after the fall of the Assad regime in an attempt to prevent the weaponry from falling into rebel hands. Israeli airstrikes in Syria had mostly stopped since the new year.

Hours before the Israeli bombings on Tuesday, Syria condemned Israel’s invasion of the buffer zone and called for it to withdraw its forces from Syrian territory. However, Israel also views Syria’s new rulers with suspicion, with Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Monday calling the new rulers of Syria a “jihadist, Islamist terror group”.

Claim: "<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israel bombing Damascus February 2025")
geolocate(<image:41>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>).

The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation)) The Wikipedia article on the Israeli invasion of Syria, which began in December 2024 and continued into 2025, mentions extensive aerial and naval strikes by Israel and the July 16, 2025, bombing of the Syrian military headquarters in Damascus.

The Guardian article includes images of Israeli forces and explosions in Syria (<image:8892>, <image:8897>, <image:8898>, <image:8899>, <image:8900>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel struck military targets outside Damascus and in southern Syria in February 2025. However, the provided images do not match the image in the claim. The claim also states that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the specific details about the image and the destruction of the last remaining army depots cannot be verified.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israel bombing Damascus February 2025")
geolocate(<image:41>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reported that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>).

The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. However, the image search did not return the same image as the claim. The geolocation data does not provide enough information to verify the claim that the image shows the surroundings of Southern Damascus.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully verified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the provided image to the bombing of Damascus in February 2025.

JERUSALEM — Israel's government said a drone targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as fighting with Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Gaza-based Hamas showed no pause after the [killing of the Hamas mastermind](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

**Drone targets Netanyahu’s house while Israeli strikes in Gaza kill more than 50** **Israel said a drone targeted the prime minister’s house; there were no casualties. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Furthermore, multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone. While the CNN article mentions Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, it does not specify that they took the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024.

Claim: "<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:53>)
web_search("Benjamin Netanyahu house drone image")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, was targeted by a drone. An NPR article from October 19, 2024, states that the drone targeted his house, while a CNN article from October 23, 2024, claims that Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack and that the house was damaged. The Guardian also reported on October 19, 2024, that Netanyahu's house was hit by a drone, causing superficial damage.

The articles mention the attack occurred in October 2024. The CNN article includes an image showing damage to the exterior of the house. <image:k> The NPR article includes an image showing smoke rising from an Israeli airstrike. <image:4619> The Guardian article includes an image of the house. <image:4623>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Furthermore, multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone. While the CNN article mentions Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, it does not specify that they took the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. While the image is likely of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by multiple news sources and geolocation data, the attack occurred in October 2024, not August 2024, as stated in the claim.

Content: "The false posts emerged after the news channel broadcast footage that appeared to show Israeli soldiers sexually abusing Palestinian prisoners at a military base.** 

“Israel’s Channel 12 asked a question in an Israeli public opinion poll: Do you agree with the claim that a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied? <image:8979>

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

**Altered screenshot**

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. The story has been updated._

The screenshots show the image originally shared by Erakat said 47% of respondents answered "yes" to a poll asking "do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian?"

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:8989>](https://cbsaustin.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

![FILE - Rep. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., also [condemned](https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962 "https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962")
 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

.

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement

The evidence confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the Middle East in August 2024, but it does not explicitly state that they were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks specific details about the warships' destination and mission.

NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:55>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Singapore': 0.32, 'Malta': 0.15, 'France': 0.1, 'South Korea': 0.07, 'Malaysia': 0.06, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.03, 'Croatia': 0.02, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Bermuda': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results do not provide any information about the location of the image in relation to Lebanon or Israel. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the new evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:55>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Singapore': 0.32, 'Malta': 0.15, 'France': 0.1, 'South Korea': 0.07, 'Malaysia': 0.06, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.03, 'Croatia': 0.02, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Bermuda': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results do not provide any information about the location of the image in relation to Lebanon or Israel. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the new evidence.

![People perform a funeral prayer for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh at the Imam Abd al-Wahhab Mosque in Doha, Qatar, on Friday, August 2. “We’ve got to make sure we’ve got the right resources and capabilities in the region.”

On a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.”

Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.

The Turkish flag is seen at half-staff at the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, on August 2.

CNN

A decision by the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv to fly its flag half-staff as part of Turkey’s national day of mourning for [Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html)
 has left members of the Israeli government and public enraged. 

Foreign Minister Israel Katz summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand” after the move, saying Israel “will not accept expressions of sympathy for a murderer like Ismail Haniyeh.“

The Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for the expulsion of the ambassador, saying Turkey’s lowering of the flag as a “tribute” to Haniyeh “shows exactly what they think of us.” 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday will be a national day of mourning for Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran this week. He was [assassinated](http://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)

The [US decision to send warships and fighter squadron to the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 will mark perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting.

The region is bracing for an Iranian retaliation after the country’s supreme leader vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week. Officials said the attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones [Iran launched against Israel in April,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/middleeast/iran-drones-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html)
 but it could also be larger and more complex, coordinated with Iranian proxies in the region. 

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of the Iran-backed group’s top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. 

“Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday.

USS Abraham Lincoln sails the Pacific Ocean on August 2.

Jerome D. Johnson Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class/US Navy

The [United States is sending](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran earlier this week.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group, which is currently operating in the Gulf of Oman, according to a statement from deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.

Destroyers and cruisers capable of ballistic missile defense will also be sent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. The statement does not say which warships have been sent, but two US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took part in intercepting the barrage of strikes Iran launched against Israel in April.

Austin also ordered the deployment of a fighter squadron to the region, Singh said.

The US already has the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship in the region, which operates with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, capable of carrying out an evacuation of US citizens in Lebanon should it be ordered.

Iran has vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing.

Dutch airline KLM is canceling its planned flights to Tel Aviv until at least October in response to the “security situation the region,” a press officer for KLM said in a statement to CNN.

The airline previously announced it was canceling flights into the Israeli capital until August 31.

KLM joins a growing list of international airlines suspending flights into and out of the Middle East. IDF also said Hezbollah on Friday tried to launch rockets toward Arab al-Aramashe, an Israeli village close to the Lebanese border, but that [the rockets did not cross into Israel](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hamas-haniyeh-iran-tensions-08-02-24#h_c791f8963fd5a31a21349cd44597a96e)

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct “multiple force posture moves” in the Middle East ahead of a possible attack by Iran on Israel, according to the Pentagon.

Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday and “informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and future defense force posture changes that the department will take to support the defense of Israel,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.

Singh declined to detail the potential moves, saying that Austin would be directing those moves “at a later time.” But the US has a number of naval assets already in the region, including a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman and amphibious assault ships and destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.

A US official separately told CNN that the additional capabilities would likely include more air defense systems to help protect Israel and US forces from a potential Iranian attack. 

Singh noted that there “could be additional” US troops that enter the region to help bolster US forces there but declined to outline specific capabilities or units that may be deployed. 

CNN reported on Thursday the Pentagon discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region. In July, the UN warned of widespread famine across [the strip](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html)
, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians. 

Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian displaced in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, told CNN that the past nine months have been engulfed by “fear and terror.” 

“This situation has become very dangerous, as hundreds of children die every day,” the 19-year-old said on Friday."

NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.
