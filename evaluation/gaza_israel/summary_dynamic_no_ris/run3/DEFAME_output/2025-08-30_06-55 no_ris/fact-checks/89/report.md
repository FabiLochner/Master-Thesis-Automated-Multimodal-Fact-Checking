An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) ![image 5685](media/2025-08-23_01-49-1755913768-315670.jpg) The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024, as stated by his son, according to the Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). Additionally, there are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)).

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. However, the bne Gulf bureau article mentions the possibility of WhatsApp being used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware, which is an unconfirmed report.

To verify the claim, more information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that an IRGC-affiliated media report claimed Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran using mobile tracking ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)). Modern Diplomacy, in an article published on August 4, 2024, suggests that Israeli intelligence may have used spyware, potentially like Pegasus, to track Haniyeh's location and intercept communications via WhatsApp ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)). <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional insights. The Jerusalem Post cites an IRGC-affiliated media report claiming Israel used mobile tracking to kill Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)). Modern Diplomacy suggests Israeli intelligence may have used spyware, like Pegasus, to track Haniyeh's location and intercept communications via WhatsApp ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)).

While the evidence doesn't definitively confirm the claim, it strengthens the possibility that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The Modern Diplomacy article specifically mentions the potential use of spyware to intercept communications on WhatsApp.

The claim is likely true, but further verification would require confirmation from independent sources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that Israel is known for its capabilities in breaking into electronic devices using malware, including Pegasus, developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. The article mentions that in 2018, Lebanon accused Israel of hacking mobile lines. The article also mentions that the Lebanese security intelligence agency was found to have run several hacking campaigns since 2012, stealing data from messaging apps like WhatsApp. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel possesses the capability to hack electronic devices using malware, including Pegasus ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/get-away-from-hezbollah-has-israel-hacked-lebanons-telecoms-networks)). This, combined with previous evidence suggesting the potential use of spyware to track Haniyeh's location and intercept communications via WhatsApp, strengthens the likelihood that Israeli intelligence could have used such methods.

The claim is likely true, given the evidence of Israel's capabilities and the reports of potential spyware use.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp, potentially using spyware. While there is no definitive proof, reports from multiple sources, including Modern Diplomacy and The Jerusalem Post, indicate the possibility. Given Israel's known capabilities in hacking electronic devices and the reports of potential spyware use, the claim is likely true. `true`
