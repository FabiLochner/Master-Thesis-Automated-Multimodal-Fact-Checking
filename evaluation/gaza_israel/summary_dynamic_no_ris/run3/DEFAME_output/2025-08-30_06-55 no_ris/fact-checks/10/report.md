### Evidence from `web_search`
The Brookings article discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/)). The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983 ([https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/)). The Wikipedia article discusses the 1968 Israeli raid on Beirut Airport ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Israeli_raid_on_Beirut_Airport)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport. ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960)) ![image 10053](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537032-375642.jpg) The BBC News website contains an image of a large explosion. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cpqz18e10gdo)) ![image 10054](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537032-722379.jpg)

Al Jazeera published an article on October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut, including an image of a plane taking off over the city. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/5/live-israel-resumes-beirut-bombing-as-lebanon-death-toll-passes-2000)) ![image 10055](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537032-871108.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, including in 2006. The image search results also include an article from Al Jazeera dated October 5, 2024, about Israel resuming bombing in Beirut. However, the geolocate results do not provide any information about the image's location.

The claim states the image is authentic and was taken in October 2024. The Al Jazeera article from October 5, 2024, mentions bombing in Beirut, which aligns with the timeframe. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or that it depicts an Israeli bombing.

More information is needed to verify the claim, such as the source of the image and confirmation that it depicts an event from October 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel launched airstrikes on Beirut in October 2024, including near the airport. The BBC and NPR articles provide images of the strikes. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim is authentic or that it depicts the October 2024 events.

Therefore, the claim is **unverified**.

### Verdict: FALSE
