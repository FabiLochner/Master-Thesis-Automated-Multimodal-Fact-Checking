The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image is from Montreal, Canada, and shows a traffic sign displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." While the mayor of Montreal, Valérie Plante, has been involved in discussions and actions related to pro-Palestinian signs, there is no evidence that she authorized the specific sign in the image. Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion that the sign was authorized by Mayor Plante is not directly supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
