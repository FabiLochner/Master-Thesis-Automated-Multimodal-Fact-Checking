## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a January 1, 2025, CNN article, Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with approximately 100,000 Palestinians leaving since October 7, 2023. The article also mentions that at least 45,553 were killed in Israeli attacks. The Times of Israel reports a 6% decline in Gaza's population since the war began, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), which indicates a decline of approximately 160,000 people. The article also mentions that around 45,500 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

Conversely, a December 19, 2024, article by the New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA) states that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Gaza Strip's population is estimated to be around 2,050,000 in 2025, a decrease of 6% since the start of the war, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip). Statista reports a total population of 2.1 million and mentions casualties and internally displaced refugees since October 7, 2023, due to the war between Hamas and Israel. The source also states that the Gaza Strip is one of the worldâ€™s most densely populated regions.

World Population Review estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth. The source is the UN World Urbanization Prospects.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, the New York City Foreign Policy Association (NYCFPA), supports the claim, stating a 2.02% increase based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, other sources, such as CNN and The Times of Israel, report a 6% *decrease* in population.

The discrepancy could be due to different methodologies, data sources, or the time frame considered. The NYCFPA's forecast from August 2023 might not reflect the actual impact of the war. The CNN and Times of Israel articles cite the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, respectively, which may have different data collection methods.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to compare the methodologies and data sources used by each source and assess their reliability. It would also be helpful to have more recent data.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. Some sources claim a population decrease, while one source supports the claim of a 2.02% increase. The conflicting information and the need for more recent data make it impossible to determine the claim's veracity. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is disputed. While one source ([NYCFPA](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) supports the claim of a 2.02% increase, other sources ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl) and The Times of Israel) report a 6% decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023. This discrepancy, along with the need for more recent data, makes it impossible to verify the claim.
