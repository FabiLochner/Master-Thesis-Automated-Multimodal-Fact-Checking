Useful result: From [Source](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire): 
Content: The New Republic reports that Donald Trump allegedly spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a ceasefire deal, fearing it would help Kamala Harris win in November. PBS reported that Trump was urging Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. Both Netanyahu's office and Trump denied the report. The article was published on August 20, 2024.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported. While there is evidence of a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing the Gaza ceasefire, the assertion that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign is based on allegations that both Trump and Netanyahu denied, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248) and [The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire).

So, the overall veracity is: false
