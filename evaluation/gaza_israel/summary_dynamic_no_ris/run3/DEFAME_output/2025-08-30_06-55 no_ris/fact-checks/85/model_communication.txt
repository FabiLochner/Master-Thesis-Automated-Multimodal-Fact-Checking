“Israel’s Channel 12 asked a question in an Israeli public opinion poll: Do you agree with the claim that a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied? <image:8979>

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

**Altered screenshot**

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. The story has been updated._

The screenshots show the image originally shared by Erakat said 47% of respondents answered "yes" to a poll asking "do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian?" Various X users later claimed the image was a doctored version of a 2022 Channel 12 poll, which asked respondents about the Israeli government's relationship with "terrorist supporters."

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:8989>](https://cbsaustin.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

![FILE - Rep. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., also [condemned](https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962 "https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962")
 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (<image:8996>). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean and could be used for a non-combatant evacuation from Lebanon (<image:8999>).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region (<image:9009>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article, from L'Orient-Le Jour, focuses on this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)).

The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The search results mention the deployment of warships to the Eastern Mediterranean, with some sources specifically mentioning Lebanon. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The presence of U.S. warships near Lebanon in August 2024 is confirmed, but the claim's assertion about supporting the IDF is not directly supported by the evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Afghan Officials: Iran’s New Quds Chief Likely Faked Identity in 2018

Print

Afghan officials say they are investigating a visit in 2018 of the new commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, to the province of Bamiyan where he claimed to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul.

Qaani, a 61-year-old brigadier general, became the chief of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), following the U.S. Esmail Qaani was in charge of QF operations in Central Asia while \[Soleimani\] himself was busy fighting the Americans, Israel and IS in Iraq, Lebanon and Levant.”

According to Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, Iran since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 has recruited thousands of Afghans into what is known as the Fatemiyoun battalion. <image:10657>

Shortly after his appointment, Afghan media circulated pictures showing him paying an official visit to Bamiyan province in July 2018, allegedly as Iran’s deputy ambassador.

The governor of Bamiyan, Mohammad Tahir Zuhair, who appeared in one of the photos giving Qaani a local tapestry, told VOA that Qaani introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat visiting the province to reiterate Iran’s support for the local government.

“Let me emphasize again that no foreign delegation ever comes to this province without Kabul coordinating the visit. We were told by Kabul that an Iranian delegation would oversee the process of building a hospital in Bamiyan,” Zuhair told VOA.

The governor said officials in Kabul instructed the local government to provide Qaani and his team with security and logistics assistance.

“The Iranian delegation spent about 45 minutes in the hospital and then came to my office and we met. He said that they came to Bamiyan to tell the people that Iran liked to help them,” he told VOA.

At the time of his visit to Bamiyan, Qaani was serving as the deputy commander of the Quds Force under Soleimani.

**Why the visit?**

Afghan officials say that Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan, raising questions about the intentions of his visit to the predominately Shiite province in central Afghanistan.

“We are investigating the exact nature and date of his visit. At this point I can assure you that he was never the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan,” Idrees Zaman, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, said in a press conference Tuesday.

Some Afghanistan analysts like Jonathan Schroden, the director of Center for Stability and Development at Washington-based research and analysis organization CNA, are charging that Iran might have arranged for the alleged disguise to prevent the Afghan government’s monitoring.

“It is hard to say whether he was actually traveling under a false title in this case; it’s possible that Iran could have named him as a DCM, if even temporarily, in whatever travel documents he had, etc., in order to provide him official cover for his travel,” Schroden said.

He however expressed some skepticism over the alleged disguise, saying it is unlikely that Iran’s commander could hide behind a bogus identity given his high-profile status for years in Iran and the wider region.

**Recruitment**

Other experts say Qaani’s visit could be seen as an effort to mobilize Shiite people to support the Quds Force, given Iran’s previous efforts to gain influence among Shiites in Afghanistan.

Regional experts say it was Qaani’s duty to actively recruit for the Quds Force among Shia populations in Afghanistan.

Farzin Nadimi, an associate fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that one of Iran’s main targets has been to establish a foothold in the Shiite areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He added that it is generally believed that “his \[Soleimani\] deputy, Gen."

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

# Your Analysis

The evidence confirms that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason provided is that Dris failed to make weight, not that he withdrew. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The ESPN article ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) mentions that this is not the first time an Algerian athlete has withdrawn from a match against Butbul.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.

Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, as reported in [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/). The attack killed one man and wounded four others. The Guardian also reports on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel). The New York Times also reports on the Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html).

The Guardian article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack <image:2533>.


## Elaboration
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.


## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about people leaving Israel, including an image of people at an airport (<image:10699>). The Times of Israel also published an image of people at an Israeli airport (<image:10702>). The Guardian published an article about panic at an Israeli airport, including an image of people at the airport (<image:10704>).


## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that people are at Israeli airports. However, none of the provided images match the original image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that a long-range Iranian-made drone hit Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based Houthi militia, as reported in [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/). The attack killed one man and wounded four others. The Guardian also reports on the Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/yemen-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-israel). The New York Times also reports on the Houthi drone strike in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility, as reported in [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/world/middleeast/houthis-drone-strike-tel-aviv.html).

The Guardian article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack <image:2533>.


## Elaboration
The image was likely taken in Israel, according to the geolocation analysis. Web searches confirm that a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv occurred on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The evidence includes an image of the aftermath of the attack, but it does not show the airport.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional evidence is needed to confirm the context of the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel airport people fleeing")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article about people leaving Israel, including an image of people at an airport (<image:10699>). The Times of Israel also published an image of people at an Israeli airport (<image:10702>). The Guardian published an article about panic at an Israeli airport, including an image of people at the airport (<image:10704>).


## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that people are at Israeli airports. However, none of the provided images match the original image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Actions
```
image_search("Israel airport July 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2578242/middle-east): 
Content: The search result from Arab News contains an image of an airplane at an airport. <image:10729>


## Elaboration
The image search for "Israel airport July 19 2024" did not return any images that match the original image. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely taken in Israel, and there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, there is no evidence to confirm that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. The image search did not return any matching images.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While the image is likely taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack. Image searches did not yield any matching images.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop.

For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City.

Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable.

Israel-Gaza: On board the plane evacuating injured Palestinians

Palestinians disembark an evacuation flight that has taken them from Egypt to the UAE

**Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering.**

The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds.

Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai.

After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

"During the war they were displaced," she tells me. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza.

I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.

Published date: 24 April 2025 11:37 BST | Last update: 4 months ago

It is 18 months since [Israel](https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel)
 declared [war on Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza)
, following the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, which killed more than 1,100 people.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)

 and other [necessities for](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/09e7c2a2-6a31-4ac4-88c9-deb023f14a10)
 food production were devastated by Israeli attacks.

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)
 to analyse food security and nutrition. The scale runs from 1 (none/minimal) to 5 (catastrophe/famine).

![Malnutrition in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-malnutrition-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=Q_cCAFdK)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

![Sanitation in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-sanitation%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=lM4cHkaX)

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)Others speak of living in makeshift tents close to raw sewage and regularly being bitten by mosquitoes, despite attempts to fend them off.

“We walk through sewage puddles daily and the awful smells fill the place,” Magdy al-Zaanen [told MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. The web search results mention the Gaza war and images of injured Palestinians, including children, in hospitals. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The Middle East Eye article mentions images from July 2024, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article from April 26, 2024, discusses the death of a baby girl in Gaza who died after her mother was killed in an Israeli airstrike (<image:10731>, <image:10732>, <image:10733>). The BBC article from February 22, 2024, shows images of Palestinian children being evacuated (<image:10746>, <image:10748>). The Middle East Eye article from April 24, 2025, discusses the impact of the war on Gaza, including images of injured Palestinians in hospitals in December 2023 and July 2024 (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. The web search results mention the Gaza war and images of injured Palestinians, including children, in hospitals. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The Middle East Eye article mentions images from July 2024, which aligns with the claim's timeframe.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.

Content: "I had to move my hand to show them that I was alive."

Doctors in Gaza saved his life and Majd spent months in hospital, breathing through a tracheostomy tube, before he was evacuated to Egypt in February this year - with Israel's permission - for further medical treatment.

Now he's in the UK for surgery at Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London to restore the function of his face.

He is the first Gazan child to arrive in the UK for treatment for war injuries, almost two years into a conflict in which more than 50,000 children have reportedly been killed or injured, [according to the UN children's charity, Unicef](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unimaginable-horrors-more-50000-children-reportedly-killed-or-injured-gaza-strip)
.

'They thought I was dead', Majd tells the BBC

His arrival follows months of work by a group of volunteer medical professionals who came together in November 2023 to set up Project Pure Hope, which helps injured and sick Gazan children get to the UK for treatment. It's our collective moral responsibility."

Doctors from the hospital have previously treated patients from Ukraine, and last year helped separate co-joined twins in Israel.

Professor Jeelani is disappointed that it has taken so long for the first child from Gaza to be treated for war injuries in the UK.

"As a doctor and as a human, I don't quite understand why it's taken us over 20 months to get to this stage," he says.

Project Pure Hope has identified 30 critically injured children in Gaza who it hopes to help bring to the UK. It is funded by private donations.

"The UK is home to some of the best paediatric facilities in the world, yet while countries like the US, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and many others have stepped up to help, the UK has yet to do the same," Project Pure Hope says.

Majd's evacuation was organised in conjunction with the US NGO, Kinder Relief, which has helped other children from Gaza get medical treatment abroad.

"We certainly saw a much easier process of evacuation to other countries," said Alisa Kireeva, its executive director.

Majd's arrival in the UK comes less than a week after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer [promised to evacuate](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5v5568mzro)
 more badly injured children, although the government has released few details of the plan.

Majd's medical team – all working for free – will include craniofacial, plastic and orthodontic surgeons, with hospital bills paid for by private donations.

"If we're able to give him a face and a jaw which he can use then it won't be completely normal, but hopefully he'll be able to feed himself and speak, and his facial expressions will be better," says lead surgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a professor of Paediatric Neurosurgery at Great Ormond Street.

"Hopefully that's going to make a big impact on how he lives and on his future.

"Our hope is that we will be able to help many more children like him in the coming months. <image:10762>!BBC Majd arriving at Heathrow airport <image:10763>BBC

Majd al-Shaghnobi arrives at Heathrow airport in London

Majd al-Shaghnobi can't eat or speak or smile like he used to.

But with his injured mouth covered by a surgical mask, his eyes were beaming as he arrived at London's Heathrow airport on a flight from Cairo, with his mother, brother and little sister.

"I'm happy to be in England and to get treatment," the 15-year-old told me.

He was trying to get humanitarian aid in the Kuwaiti area of northern Gaza in February last year when an Israeli tank shell exploded nearby, shattering his jaw bone and injuring his leg.

"One of my friends helped me and took me to the hospital," he says. "I just want them to be safe."

Gazan boy first to be treated in UK for war injuries

! It says the government's announcement is "vital and long-overdue", but time is of the essence.

"Every day of delay risks the lives and futures of children who deserve a chance to live, to recover and to rebuild a life," said Omar Din, its co-founder.

In April, the group of volunteers secured visas for two girls -13-year-old Rama and five-year-old Ghena - with life-long medical conditions to also have privately funded operations in the UK.

They were [brought to London](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgpy75v0nxo)
 after being evacuated to Egypt from Gaza, where - with the destruction of the healthcare system there - they weren't receiving the treatment they needed.

Since I met them in early May, Rama has put on weight and Ghena, who was deeply traumatised and withdrawn, is noticeably more playful.

Ghena has had laser surgery to relieve the pressure in her left eye, which she was at risk of losing. <image:10762>!Ghena guitar <image:10767>

Ghena was at risk of losing her left eye

Both girls are doing well, their mothers say.

But they are sick with worry - finding it hard to eat and sleep - about family members left behind in Gaza, who are now struggling to feed themselves.

"It's better than Gaza here," Rama tells me. "There are no bombs and no fear."

But friends message her from Gaza, telling her that they haven't found bread for 10 days and she says her older brother is sleeping on the street after first his home, and then his tent, were bombed.

"They're hungry."

CNN  — 

An Israeli strike killed 15 people, including women and children, gathered outside a health center in the central Gazan city of [Deir Al Balah](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/gaza-winter-palestinians-intl-latam)
 on Thursday, according to medical staff and officials in the enclave.

The Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in [Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/middleeast/gaza-fuel-babies-incubator-intl)
 said eight of those killed in the strike were children, with the youngest under two years old, according to his mother, and the oldest aged 14. The hospital said three women and four men were also killed.

In footage obtained by CNN, several children were seen lying motionless and others appeared injured amid the sound of screams. I was so happy to hear his first words.”

Her nine-year-old remains in critical condition, she also said.

The bodies of two children lie on the floor of Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al Balah on Thursday.

The director general of Gaza’s health ministry said the strike hit near a medical center dispensing children’s formula to women.

Project HOPE, an American aid organization, said the strike occurred “directly in front” of one of its health clinics, where people were waiting to receive treatment for “malnutrition, infections, chronic illnesses, and more.”

The organization’s CEO Rabih Torbay told CNN the location of the clinic had been shared with the Israeli military. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates to minimize harm as much as possible,” the Israeli military said in a statement to CNN.

The youngest victim of the strike was 17-month-old Mohammad, whose mother Donia Halhoul told CNN she had been waiting to receive food aid for her children from the health center when the deadly strikes landed.

“I’m in so much pain all over my body, but what hurt me more is that Mohammad died hungry while I was waiting to get him and his siblings nutritional supplements,” she told CNN by phone from the hospital.

”He was so young that he had only started to say a few words before he was killed. “It was a deconflicted site,” Torbay said.

“Project HOPE’s health clinics are a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more,” he said in a statement.

“Yet, this morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open,” he continued. Speaking to CNN from Al Mawasi in southern Gaza, Mughaisib stressed that there has been no improvement in access to aid and medicine despite Israel’s [partial lifting](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/middleeast/us-israel-aid-gaza-looting-intl)
 of the blockade on Gaza.

“Every day there is hundreds of people killed and injured when they are going (to the aid distribution points) to pick their food kits or parcels,” he said adding, “In the market you don’t find food. I mean, the bakeries are closed.”

Mughaisib told CNN Gaza’s population is “totally exhausted, broken, tired,” saying “hope is really a fragile word in Gaza.”

Israel has intensified its strikes and expanded a ground operation on parts of Gaza as negotiators in Doha [continue talks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/politics/netanyahu-trump-gaza-ceasefire-deal)
 to release hostages, establish a temporary truce and allow the entry of more humanitarian aid to the devastated strip.

Almost 3,000 Palestinians were killed over the past month in Gaza, according to the enclave’s health ministry.

Meanwhile, Hamas have continued conducting guerilla-style attacks against the Israeli military, killing more than 20 soldiers in different parts of the strip over the same period, including five soldiers killed this week in the northern city of Beit Hanoun.

On Thursday, a 20-year-old Israeli man was killed in an attack at the Gush Etzion junction south of Jerusalem, according to the Israeli military and medical services.

The IDF said two Palestinian “terrorists” had “conducted a combined shooting and stabbing attack” before being “eliminated.” Gush Etzion is a settlement cluster in the occupied West Bank.

A security source later told CNN that the two attackers were Palestinian Authority policemen with no prior records in Israel or prior arrests."

They represent the latest group of children brought to the Bay Area for medical treatment by a group called HEAL Palestine.

Just getting them to the Bay Area was a major challenge, the group said.

"The logistics of getting them out is also a nightmare," said Talha Baquar with HEAL Palestine. He said the medical situation in Gaza has become desperate because hospitals are in shambles.

"The ones that had reopened were running on bare minimum, fumes," he said. He suffered injuries to his legs and will be treated at a hospital in Oakland. One of the children who's coming today, he's been on a waitlist to get out. He's had his medical visa since November of last year."

Among those who welcomed the children at San Francisco International Airport was Dr. Mohammed Subeh, an emergency room doctor who has traveled to Gaza multiple times to help. He actually treated two of the three children when he was last there."

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image was likely taken in Palestine during the Gaza war and that children were injured and in need of medical treatment. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the girl holding her sister's oxygen mask or the sister's death. The provided evidence includes images of children receiving oxygen and being treated in hospitals.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed due to the lack of specific information about the image's context. More information is needed to verify the details of the image.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost, according to shopisrael.com ([https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X)).

Variety ([https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)) mentions that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has expressed support for Israel amid the conflict. <image:0>, <image:2699>, <image:2700>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).

From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp):

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

**GAZA CITY, Palestine**

A 70-year-old Palestinian woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, still grapples with the trauma of being viciously attacked by an Israeli army dog in her small home In Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, located in the northern Gaza Strip. 

While lying in bed after her night prayers, she was suddenly attacked by an Israeli army dog, which stormed into her room and bit deeply into her arm.

This incident occurred during a 20-day attack by the Israeli military on the camp from May 12 to May 31.

Recounting her ordeal to Anadolu, the elderly woman said: "As I was drifting off to sleep, the dog wearing a camera on its back entered the room and attacked me. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

Your email address will not be published. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.
