## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website boughtbyzionism.org discusses Vice President Kamala Harris's support for Israel, referencing an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on July 22, 2024, and includes an image of protestors (![image 1552](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007798-062130.jpg)) criticizing Harris's support for Israel. Reuters published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's (![image 1560](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007807-426714.jpg)).

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including her call for a cease-fire and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that on July 22, 2024, Kamala Harris's support for Israel was a topic of discussion. The website boughtbyzionism.org references an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on July 22, 2024, and USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, amid Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New Jersey Monitor, Reuters, and The Guardian reported on a meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, D.C. on July 25, 2024. The New Jersey Monitor ([https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/25/vp-harris-meets-with-netanyahu-to-discuss-israel-hamas-war-in-gaza/](https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/25/vp-harris-meets-with-netanyahu-to-discuss-israel-hamas-war-in-gaza/)) mentions Harris expressing concern about the suffering in Gaza and her support for a two-state solution (![image 10393](media/2025-08-30_07-10-1756537845-479567.jpg)). Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/)) reports that Harris stated, "It is time for this war to end," and pressured Netanyahu to reach a Gaza ceasefire deal (![image 10415](media/2025-08-30_07-10-1756537855-953053.jpg)).

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)) reported that Harris said, "I will not be silent" on the suffering in Gaza and stated her "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" (![image 10416](media/2025-08-30_07-10-1756537858-505127.jpg), ![image 10417](media/2025-08-30_07-11-1756537860-895758.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024, as stated in the claim. During this meeting, Harris expressed concern about the suffering in Gaza, supported a two-state solution, and stated her "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel." However, the evidence does not contain the exact quote from the claim.

Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and discussed the Israel-Gaza conflict. While Harris expressed support for Israel, the exact quote from the claim ("Our support for Israel will continue") on July 22, 2024, is not found in the provided evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and discussed the Israel-Gaza conflict, the provided sources do not contain the exact quote from the claim ("Our support for Israel will continue") on July 22, 2024. The meeting on July 25th is documented by the New Jersey Monitor, Reuters, and The Guardian.
