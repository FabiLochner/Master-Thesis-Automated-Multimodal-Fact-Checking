Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/synchronized-swimming-olympics.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article about synchronized swimming at the Olympics. <image:5921>

The claim '<image:14> This image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out 'Bring Them Home' at the 2024 Olympic games because they were not allowed to wear their yellow 'Bring Them Home' pins.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool, but it is not from the 2024 Olympics, as confirmed by sources like WKYC ([https://www.wkyc.com/video/news/verify/olympics-verify/israel-swim-team-bring-them-home-now-image-not-from-olympics-video/536-9ef735d9-23f4-4928-9611-d6607538e54f](https://www.wkyc.com/video/news/verify/olympics-verify/israel-swim-team-bring-them-home-now-image-not-from-olympics-video/536-9ef735d9-23f4-4928-9611-d6607538e54f)) and the JPost ([https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-812636](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-812636)). The team was also not allowed to wear their "Bring Them Home" pins at the Olympic games.

So, the overall veracity is: false
