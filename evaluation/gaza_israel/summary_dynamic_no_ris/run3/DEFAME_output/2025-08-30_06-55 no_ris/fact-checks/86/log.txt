Content: The article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses American warships en route to Lebanon. <image:9017>

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article about U.S. warships. The article includes an image of a warship. <image:9018>

Useful result: From [Source](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean): 
Content: The search result from Stratfor contains an image of a U.S. warship. <image:9019>

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence from sources like NPR and USNI News ([https://www.npr.org/](https://www.npr.org/)) confirms the presence of U.S. warships near Lebanon in August 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

So, the overall veracity is: false
