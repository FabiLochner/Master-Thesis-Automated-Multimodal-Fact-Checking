An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 and other [communications devices](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-second-wave-tech-pager-explosions-beirut-nabatieh-tyre-saida/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched an attack on Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. The image search results show images of fire and blasts at the airbase. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely false. The image may depict a different event or be digitally altered. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

 [airstrikes](https://www.newarab.com/news/huge-blasts-gaza-suggests-israel-using-suicide-apcs)
 on the Sabra neighbourhood in Gaza City.

Emergency workers spent hours digging through the debris after the strikes flattened residential buildings, leaving civilians buried under concrete, wood, and metal. According to local reports, civil defence teams also rescued a mother and three of her children from the same area.

Mohamad Safa, a Lebanese diplomat and UN representative, wrote on X: "The baby who remained under the rubble all night in Gaza has made it safely. Share positivity."

The widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and renewed attention on the toll it has taken on children.

"The picture says it all: an attempt to rescue a baby from beneath the rubble of his home. Most hospitals and medical facilities across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.

UNRWA also noted that humanitarian workers, medical personnel, and journalists continue to be killed in the course of Israel's military operations.

Earlier this year, records showed that over 38,000 Palestinian children have been orphaned and at least 13,901 women widowed since the start of Israel’s assault.

Gaza's civil defence teams and the Palestinian Ministry of Health have repeatedly warned that Israel’s ongoing blockade and bombardment have crippled emergency response capabilities. If they survive the bombs, they are often left wounded, traumatised, or buried beneath the rubble of their homes. They grow up not with toys, but with the sounds of drones and airstrikes."

Five-year-old Ward Khalil survived an Israeli air attack early on Monday that killed her mother, two of her siblings and 33 other people \[Al Jazeera\]

Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a 36-year-old paediatrician and mother of 10, spent the morning of Friday, May 23, doing what she had devoted her life to: Saving children at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital. Two remain buried beneath the rubble, including her youngest, six-month-old Sayden, still asleep in his crib when Dr al-Najjar kissed him goodbye that morning.

In just one Israeli air strike – in just one minute – her entire world was annihilated.

Her husband Hamdy, 40, also a doctor, and their son Adam, 11, are in the ICU, their lives hanging by a thread inside Gaza’s disintegrating health system – not by chance but by design. She was one of 18,000 Palestinian children killed since October, one of 1,300+ since Israel broke the ceasefire in March, and one of dozens in just 48 hours.

Commenting on the moral double standards applied to Palestinians, Dan Sheehan, editor at Literary Hub, noted: “If an 11-year-old Israeli influencer – a girl who delivered food and toys to displaced children – had been killed, the Empire State Building would be lit up for her. Video footage showed Danny Danon – his Israeli counterpart – stifling a yawn in response.

In the face of the death of Palestinian children, Israel yawns in indifference. This is unsurprising, with a recent poll showing that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis support expelling Palestinians from Gaza. How can Palestinians be told, then, to bring themselves – and their children – to Israeli military aid delivery stations and expect safety, not savagery? Will the number of 18,000 Palestinian children – whose names we may never fully know – not be enough?

In December 2023, UNICEF, the UN’s children’s agency, declared: “The Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.” On May 27, the organisation stated that “Since the end of the ceasefire on 18 March, 1,309 children have reportedly been killed and 3,738 injured. But, in Gaza, girls running from fire, pulled from the rubble and burned beyond recognition are not enough to provoke action.

In Gaza, when children are caught in the fire of relentless bombing, the world turns its back. In tears, Dr Alaa begged rescuers to let her hold her daughter one last time.

Sadly, the white shrouds wrapped around the bodies of Gaza’s children continue to mount.

Yaqeen Hammad is now one of those shrouded and buried children.

Just 11 years old, Yaqeen was one of Gaza’s youngest social media influencers. In one of her videos, while preparing food, she told the world: “In Gaza, we don’t know the word impossible.” This was her crime.

On May 23, the same day Alaa’s children were incinerated, Israel decided that Yaqeen was somehow a threat to its existence."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996): 
Content: "Residents had to open a hole in the wall to evacuate the dead and wounded**,” UNRWA told _UN News_.

Since the start of the war between Hamas and Israel on 7 October 2023, **more than 400 schools have received a direct hit**, according to satellite imagery analyzed by the UN.

**Deadly aftermath**
--------------------

Footage from the scene provided by the UN agency showed walls and floors blown out in the main school building.

In the courtyard, hundreds of people could be seen standing amid crumpled metal sheeting on the morning after the attack, with rubble and wooden planks strewn around where their shelters had been standing just hours earlier.

“Our colleagues are reporting that surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours,” UNRWA said.

The agency noted that fatalities included women and children, while search and rescue operations are ongoing for several people still missing.

Many of those living at the school when it was hit have been displaced “countless times” by the war, which began on 7 October 2023, following Hamas-led terror attacks on Israel, UNRWA stressed.

The attack also sparked a fire in an adjacent school where more tents and temporary shelters were burned and damaged.

Education destroyed
-------------------

[According to the UN Satellite Service, UNOSAT](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/verification-damages-schools-based-proximity-damaged-sites-gaza-occupied-palestinian-territory-update-9-may-2025)
, 95.4 per cent of schools in Gaza have sustained damage since the start of the war.

**Of the enclave’s 564 schools, 501 will either need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again**.

“There is no humanity left in Gaza, and no humanity left as the world continues to watch day after day as families are bombed, burned alive and starved,” UNRWA said after the latest attack.

**Failed strategy won’t work: Türk**
------------------------------------

In a related development, the [UN human rights chief](https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/high-commissioner)
 Volker Türk [on Wednesday condemned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/turk-israeli-plans-expand-gaza-offensive-aggravate-concerns-regarding)
 Israel’s reported plans to forcibly transfer Gaza’s population to a small area in the south of the Strip.

**The move fuels concern that Israel’s intention is to make life for Palestinians “increasingly incompatible with their continued existence in Gaza”**, he said in a statement.

> 'Surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours' - UNRWA

“There is no reason to believe that doubling down on military strategies, which, for a year and eight months, have not led to a durable resolution, including the release of all hostages, will now succeed,” insisted the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Expanding the offensive on Gaza “will almost certainly cause further mass displacement, more deaths and injuries of innocent civilians, and the destruction of Gaza’s little remaining infrastructure”, he continued.

**Rights experts warn of irreversible consequences**
----------------------------------------------------

Escalating atrocities in Gaza mark a critical moral turning point and demand urgent international action, UN-appointed independent human rights experts said [in a statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/end-unfolding-genocide-or-watch-it-end-life-gaza-un-experts-say-states-face)
.

Aftermath of a 6 May Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school turned shelter in Al Bureij, Gaza where 30 people were reported killed, among them women and children.

**Occupied West Bank update**
-----------------------------

In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, UN aid teams warned of worsening conditions for Palestinian communities **because of “violence by Israeli forces and settlers”**.

The alert comes after Israeli forces on Monday demolished more than 30 structures in Khallet Athaba, a hamlet in Hebron governorate, displacing nearly a dozen families – or around 50 people.

“This constitutes most of the structures in the community and marks the third and largest demolition there since February,” said UN aid coordination office, [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)

New horror in Gaza as double strike on school shelter kills 30
==============================================================

**By** **Daniel Johnson**

7 May 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Grim details emerged on Wednesday of Israeli airstrikes on a UN-run school in Gaza sheltering 2,000 displaced people, which reportedly killed 30 Palestinians sheltering there.

The UN agency for Palestine refugees, [UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
, maintained that Israeli forces hit the school in Al Bureij, Middle Gaza, at around 6pm on Tuesday and again at 10.20pm.

“**The school sustained severe damage and a fire broke out in the shelter, making it difficult to evacuate the casualties. – Israel continues its relentless destruction of life in Gaza**,” they warned, citing attacks by land, air and sea, and a soaring civilian death toll.

“No one is spared – not children, persons with disabilities, nursing mothers, journalists, health professionals, aid workers, or hostages,” they said, noting that on 18 March alone, 600 Palestinians were reportedly killed, 400 of them children. They are among more than 100 buildings slated for demolition, following an Israeli notice issued at the start of the month.

**Forcible transfer fears**
---------------------------

OCHA described how dozens of families in the camp were given little time on Monday to collect their belongings before their homes were demolished.

The agency highlighted the “strong push” to uproot Palestinians living in the area “**once again raising concerns about the risks of forcible transfer of the population**”.

Under international law, Israel as the occupying power, has the responsibility to protect Palestinians in the West Bank and ensure their safety and dignity, OCHA insisted.

Humanitarian partners are mobilizing assistance, but urgent international engagement is needed to stop these coercive measures and protect vulnerable communities, the UN aid office said.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children are killed in latest Israeli strikes in Gaza, health officials say
=================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 May 24, 2025 6:47 PM EDT

CAIRO (AP) — The bodies of 79 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday, a toll that doesn’t include hospitals in the battered north that it said are now inaccessible.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children were among those killed in Israel’s renewed military offensive, colleagues and the Health Ministry said.

Alaa Najjar, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital, was on duty at the time and ran home to find her family’s house on fire, Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital’s pediatric department, told The Associated Press.

[**READ MORE:** Palestinian children suffering from malnutrition overwhelm Gaza’s Nasser Hospital](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-children-suffering-from-malnutrition-overwhelm-gazas-nasser-hospital)

Najjar’s husband was severely wounded and their only surviving child, an 11-year-old son, was in critical condition after Friday’s strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, Farra said.

The dead children ranged in age from 7 months to 12 years old. Khalil Al-Dokran, a spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, told the AP that two of the children remained under the rubble.

Israel’s military in a statement said it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces, and described the area of Khan Younis as a “dangerous war zone.” It said it had evacuated civilians from the area, and “the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”

Earlier on Saturday, a statement said Israel’s air force struck over 100 targets throughout Gaza over the past day.

The Health Ministry said the new deaths brought the war’s toll to 53,901 since the Oct. and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.

Hospitals in Gaza are again reporting attacks and other Israeli pressure.

The Health Ministry said 11 security personnel have been trapped at the European Hospital in southern Gaza following heavy gunfire and airstrikes since at least Tuesday. This week, the [first aid trucks entered](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/netanyahu-says-hell-allow-some-aid-into-gaza-after-pressure-from-allies)
 the territory and began reaching Palestinians since the blockade began.

COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid for Gaza, said 388 trucks had entered since Monday. Hams said the security staff stayed behind to protect from looting, and that it was the only hospital in Gaza offering neurosurgery, cardiac care and cancer treatment.

Israel said it will continue to strike Gaza until Hamas releases all of the 58 remaining Israeli hostages and disarms. Netanyahu has rejected those terms and has vowed to maintain control over Gaza and facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its Palestinian population.

“The Israeli government and its leader have a clear choice: deal or war, saving lives or abandonment,” Liran Berman, brother of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman, told a weekly rally in Tel Aviv as families and supporters again demanded an agreement that would bring everyone home.

 [Samy Magdy, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/samy-magdy-associated-press) The ministry said 3,747 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed the war on March 18 in an effort to pressure Hamas to accept different ceasefire terms. Its count doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Israel’s pressure on Hamas has included a blockade of Gaza and its over 2 million people since early March. Saleh Hams, director of the nursing department, said patients were evacuated after an Israeli strike on May 13. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others.

Hamas has said it will only return the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from the territory."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:59>)
web_search("Palestinian child rubble Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("child trapped rubble Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News reported on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents))

The New Arab published an article on June 3, 2025, about a baby rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The article mentions that widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The article also mentions that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023. <image:59>

### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published a video about rescue workers fighting to save children trapped in Gaza City airstrike rubble. (<image:10680>) Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, which includes an image of children near rubble. (<image:10681>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

The image likely depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike, as indicated by the geolocate tool and web searches. However, the exact date of the image, July 2024, cannot be verified with the available evidence. Therefore, the claim is missing information about the date. `not enough information`

Some parents reported speaking to their children about what to do if one or both of their parents were killed, such as where important documents are and where to find aid or shelter.[\[14\]](#cite_note-npr20231019-15)
 Hospital and emergency workers in Gaza noted that parents and relatives of some children wrote on children's bodies, mostly on their legs and abdomens, so the children would be identifiable if found in the rubble or get lost. **[^](#cite_ref-3)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:59>)
web_search("Palestinian child rubble Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("child trapped rubble Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News reported on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents))

The New Arab published an article on June 3, 2025, about a baby rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The article mentions that widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The article also mentions that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023. <image:59>

### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published a video about rescue workers fighting to save children trapped in Gaza City airstrike rubble. (<image:10680>) Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, which includes an image of children near rubble. (<image:10681>)

*   [https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)
*   [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News article from May 7, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school in Al Bureij, Gaza, which killed 30 Palestinians, including women and children. The article also mentions that more than 400 schools have received a direct hit since the start of the war on October 7, 2023. ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996)) <image:10682>

PBS News published an article on May 24, 2025, reporting on Israeli strikes in Gaza, including an airstrike in Khan Younis that killed nine of a doctor's ten children. The article also states that the war's toll has reached 53,901 since October. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nine-of-a-doctors-10-children-are-killed-in-latest-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-health-officials-say](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nine-of-a-doctors-10-children-are-killed-in-latest-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-health-officials-say)) <image:10683>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Save the Children published an article about children in Gaza, including an image of a child standing in front of rubble. ([https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza)) <image:10688> VPM.org published an article on October 7, 2024, with photos from the year since October 7, including an image of children near rubble. ([https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7)) <image:10689>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a [collapsed apartment](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-20-2025-36c07d3dc7c03f66f86f44409d504d43)
 building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli [airstrike](https://apnews.com/live/latest-updates-israel-launches-new-wave-of-airstrikes-across-gaza-after-ceasefire-talks-stall)
.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article "Effect of the Gaza war on children in the Gaza Strip" discusses the impact of the conflict on children, including deaths, injuries, and displacement, with many children killed in Israeli airstrikes and buried under rubble. The article also mentions the challenges faced by orphaned children and the lack of access to basic necessities. The Associated Press published an article on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother.

The Wikipedia article mentions that in July 2024, the number of unaccompanied children was likely to be above the February 2024 estimate of 17,000.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters reported on December 29, 2023, about a baby saved from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli strike.

The Wikipedia article mentions that in July 2024, the number of unaccompanied children was likely to be above the February 2024 estimate of 17,000. However, the exact date the image was taken cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The image likely depicts a Palestinian child trapped under rubble in Gaza, as confirmed by the geolocation and search results. The evidence indicates that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, and there have been rescue efforts. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but lacks specific date verification. `false`
