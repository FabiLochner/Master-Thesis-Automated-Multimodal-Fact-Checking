The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. While multiple sources ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/), and [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)) confirm the attack on Ramat David Airbase by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, the geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
