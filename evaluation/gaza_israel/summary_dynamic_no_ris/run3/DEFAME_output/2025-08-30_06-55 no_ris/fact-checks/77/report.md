### Evidence from `web_search`
The Johns Hopkins University published an article on February 4, 2025, discussing a study that debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran in October 2024 was a nuclear weapons test, mentioning misinformation linking the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening (![image 10616](media/2025-08-30_07-24-1756538674-713713.jpg)). NDTV published an article on October 7, 2024, discussing earthquakes in Iran and Israel on October 5, 2024, which sparked speculation about covert nuclear testing (<image:k>). An article from alphadefense.in, published on October 7, 2024, discusses a seismic event in Iran on October 5, 2024, which sparked speculation about whether it was an earthquake or an underground nuclear test (![image 10631](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538723-858437.jpg), ![image 10632](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538725-517127.jpg)).
