Content: The South China Morning Post discusses young Israelis in Pai, Thailand. <image:9994>

The claim '<image:4> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple news sources from February 2025, such as the [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai) and [The Nation Thailand](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434), refute the idea of Israeli settlements in Pai District, Thailand, finding no evidence of such. The image is related to the topic, as it is included in an article discussing concerns about Israelis in Pai.

So, the overall veracity is: false
