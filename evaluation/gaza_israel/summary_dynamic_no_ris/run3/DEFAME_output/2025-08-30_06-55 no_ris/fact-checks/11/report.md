## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Herzi Halevi served as the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces from January 16, 2023, to March 5, 2025, according to his Wikipedia page (<image:k>). He resigned on March 5, 2025, as reported by Al Jazeera, due to failures related to the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack. (<image:k>) The Jerusalem Post reported that Halevi ended his position earlier in March 2025 and was replaced by Eyal Zamir. (<image:j>, <image:k>)



### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, a Hezbollah drone attack targeted an Israeli army base in Binyamina, north of Tel Aviv, resulting in the death of four soldiers and injuries to over 60 others (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The attack was in retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut and part of the ongoing Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict. The IDF is investigating how the drone entered Israel without triggering an alert.

The Associated Press also reported on the attack, confirming the death of four soldiers (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Herzi Halevi was the Chief of the General Staff of the IDF during the time of the alleged attack. However, the evidence does not mention that Halevi was assassinated in the drone attack. The attack on October 13, 2024, resulted in the death of four soldiers and injuries to over 60 others.

The claim that Halevi was assassinated in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence. The evidence only confirms the occurrence of the drone attack and Halevi's position at the time.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, and Herzi Halevi was the Chief of the IDF at the time, there is no evidence to support the claim that Halevi was assassinated in the attack. The attack resulted in the death of other soldiers.

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided evidence does not support the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in the drone attack. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base occurred on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, there is no evidence in the provided sources, including reports from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina), and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2), to support the assertion that Herzi Halevi, the IDF chief at the time, was assassinated in the attack.
