Useful result: From [Source](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/focus-areas/combating-anti-semitism):

Useful result: From [Source](https://combatantisemitism.org/studies-reports/congresswoman-luna-and-the-jfk-files-how-antisemitic-conspiracy-theorists-hijack-history-to-spread-hate/): 
Content: The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study on March 6, 2025, discussing how antisemitic conspiracy theorists use the assassination of JFK to spread hate online. The study mentions that Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced she would lead a task force to declassify files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The article also mentions an executive order issued by President Donald Trump. The article includes several examples of antisemitic posts and images. <image:10336>

The claim 'The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'.' is false.
Justification: The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has not amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism to include the assassination of JFK. The IHRA definition, as provided by the WJC, does not mention JFK, and there is no evidence of such an amendment. A study by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) in March 2025 discussed antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the JFK assassination, but this is not the WJC.

So, the overall veracity is: false
