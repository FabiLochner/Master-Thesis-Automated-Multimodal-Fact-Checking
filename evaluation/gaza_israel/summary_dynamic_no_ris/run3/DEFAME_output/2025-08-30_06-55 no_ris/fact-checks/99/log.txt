Content: Morocco World News published an article on June 26, 2024, about an Israeli police dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during a raid in the Jabalia refugee camp. The article mentions a leaked video obtained by Al Jazeera. The woman, Dawlat Al Tanani, said the dog bit her because she was resisting eviction from her home. The article includes a link to the footage.

Useful result: From [Source](https://pchrgaza.org/israeli-military-dog-attacked-me-while-asleep-and-viciously-bit-my-shoulder/): 
Content: The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) published an article on July 7, 2024, titled "Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder." The article includes a video from Al Jazeera showing an Israeli military dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman. The article describes an attack that occurred on May 14, 2024, in which a dog bit a 58-year-old woman's shoulder. <image:10860>

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **unproven**. While there is evidence of Israeli army dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women in May 2024, the specific image in the claim could not be verified through image or web searches. The attacks occurred in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp, as reported by sources like [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/elderly-palestinian-woman-recounts-terrifying-attack-by-israeli-army-dog-in-gaza/3262376) and [Morocco World News](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
