# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
image_search("dog with flashlight on head")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
image_search("dog with flashlight on head")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

Your email address will not be published. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs attacked elderly Palestinian women in May 2024. The attacks occurred in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp. The claim's date of June 2024 is close to the reported attacks in May 2024. However, the evidence does not provide the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is plausible, but the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.
