Useful result: From [Source](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/a-fragile-but-enduring-truce-in-yemen/): 
Content: The Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies published an article on August 27, 2024, discussing the ongoing conflict in Yemen. The article mentions that the Houthis continued to target ships and attempted to strike Eilat with missiles and drones, including a drone attack on Tel Aviv. It also mentions that in December 2023, the United States and its allies launched Operation “Prosperity Guardian” to counter Houthi actions.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that the Houthis continued military operations after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and missile launches, and that the US, under Trump, conducted airstrikes. A ceasefire was brokered in May 2025, but attacks resumed in July 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
