## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo)) discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages in February 2025, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-of-blood-protesters-stage-mock-funeral-for-slain-hostages-demand-deal/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-of-blood-protesters-stage-mock-funeral-for-slain-hostages-demand-deal/)) and Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages)) report on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where demonstrators carried mock coffins to represent hostages held in Gaza. ![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-466872.jpg), ![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-848473.jpg), ![image 4537](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911061-234441.jpg), ![image 4538](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911062-238270.jpg), ![image 4539](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911063-664037.jpg), ![image 49](media/80.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website contains an image of coffins draped with Israeli flags (![image 4548](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911083-761452.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article about Hamas, which included an image of a protest (![image 4549](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911083-936573.jpg)).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.98, 'Palestine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0, 'Bermuda': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins were used to represent hostages held in Gaza. The evidence indicates that the coffins were not of dead Israeli soldiers, but rather a symbolic representation of the hostages.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, to represent hostages held in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers.
