The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by sources like [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017), the image provided in the claim does not match the images of the damage found in the search results, including satellite images from sources like [Firstpost.com](https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-earthquake-satellite-images-show-destruction-in-civil-war-ravaged-country-13875771.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
