The Wikipedia article includes images of the damage ![image 2914](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168744-791372.jpg), ![image 2915](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168745-230086.jpg), ![image 2916](media/2025-08-02_21-05-1754168751-371194.jpg), ![image 2917](media/2025-08-02_21-06-1754168774-769745.jpg), ![image 2918](media/2025-08-02_21-06-1754168775-895147.jpg).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results mention an earthquake in Myanmar and show satellite images of the destruction. Firstpost.com ([https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-earthquake-satellite-images-show-destruction-in-civil-war-ravaged-country-13875771.html](https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-earthquake-satellite-images-show-destruction-in-civil-war-ravaged-country-13875771.html)) and Israel Hayom ([https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/03/30/massive-destruction-satellite-images-reveal-earthquake-devastation-in-myanmar/](https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/03/30/massive-destruction-satellite-images-reveal-earthquake-devastation-in-myanmar/)) both published satellite images. ![image 10013](media/2025-08-30_06-55-1756536944-025987.jpg), ![image 10014](media/2025-08-30_06-55-1756536944-526500.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. The search results provide images of the damage, including satellite images. However, none of the images match the one in the claim.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is about an image depicting the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. While the evidence confirms the occurrence of a significant earthquake in Myanmar on the specified date, the images provided by the search results do not match the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by sources like [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017), the image provided in the claim does not match the images of the damage found in the search results, including satellite images from sources like [Firstpost.com](https://www.firstpost.com/world/myanmar-earthquake-satellite-images-show-destruction-in-civil-war-ravaged-country-13875771.html).
