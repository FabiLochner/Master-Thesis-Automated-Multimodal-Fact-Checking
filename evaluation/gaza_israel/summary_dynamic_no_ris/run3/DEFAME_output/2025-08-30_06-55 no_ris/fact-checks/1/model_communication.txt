JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Abstract
--------

On March 28, 2025, a catastrophic Mw 7.7 earthquake struck central Myanmar along the Sagaing Fault, a major dextral strike-slip boundary between the Burma Microplate and Sunda Plate. Lessons from Myanmar’s catastrophe provide a critical blueprint for improving resilience in rapidly developing seismically vulnerable regions globally.

The first studies of the 28 March 2025 magnitude 7.8 Myanmar earthquake suggest that the southern portion of its rupture occurred at supershear velocity, reaching speeds of 5 to 6 kilometers per second.

In their paper published in _The Seismic Record_, seismologists Lingling Ye, Thorne Lay and Hiroo Kanamori share new details about the [devastating earthquake](https://phys.org/tags/devastating+earthquake/)
, which caused widespread and severe damage in Myanmar and neighboring countries such as Thailand, with more than 5,000 confirmed casualties. It is comparable to the roughly 400-kilometer-long 1906 San Francisco rupture, but longer than the 2023 East Anatolian Fault earthquake in Türkiye and the 2002 Denali earthquake in Alaska.

"The length of the rupture is on the high end relative to the seismic moment, but I suspect that the relative straightness of the fault in the southern two-thirds of the rupture helped enable rupture along the southern end, combined with the long time since prior large [rupture](https://phys.org/tags/rupture/)
 of the central portion of the [fault](https://phys.org/tags/fault/)
," said Lay.

**More information:** Lingling Ye et al, The 28 March 2025 Mw 7.8 Myanmar Earthquake: Preliminary Analysis of an ∼480 km Long Intermittent Supershear Rupture, _The Seismic Record_ (2025). But the 28 March earthquake ruptured a part of the fault between Mandalay and Nay Pyi Taw that had been seismically quiet since 1912 and 1839.

The characteristics of the preceding "seismic gap" are still unclear, said Lay.

"The 2025 event appears to have ruptured a bit further north and further south than might be expected from the locations of prior events in 1956 in the north and 1930 in the south, but the precise locations and slip distributions for those events are not known," he explained. *   share this!

The researchers analyzed seismic and [satellite imagery](https://phys.org/tags/satellite+imagery/)
 to conclude that the rupture had a large slip of up to seven meters that extended about 85 kilometers north of the earthquake's epicenter near the city of Mandalay. "That was unusually clear and convincing evidence for supershear rupture relative to other long strike-slip events that I have worked on."

"This is one of the closest seismic stations to record the rupture passage for a great earthquake. Earthquake seismologists have long desired to have near-fault records like this." Ye added.

The weak initial P waves hit the station about 36 seconds after the earthquake began, with much stronger motions starting just 12 seconds after that.

The strong directivity of the rupture toward the south, combined with the supershear velocity, may have been responsible for the damaging impacts felt as far away as Bangkok, the researchers suggested.

There have been several large earthquakes of magnitude 7 or larger in the 20th century along the Sagaing Fault, particularly along the northern portion of the fault."

!Trump should not forget the Russian hand behind the Houthis <image:635>

On March 15, US President Donald Trump [ordered](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-launches-strikes-against-yemens-houthis-warns-iran-2025-03-15/)
 large-scale airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. By the summer of 2024, the Houthis provided Russia with [hundreds of Yemenis](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-terrorist-designation-russias-yemen-strategy/)
 who were reportedly then forced into Russian military training. While the United States has sought to ensure freedom of navigation against Houthi attacks, so that global trade continues to flow, Russia has aided Houthi operations as a way to ratchet up problems for the United States and its allies and partners.

Trump and US negotiators should refrain from further coddling the Kremlin. What does this mean for Yemen, Iran, and beyond?](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react-trump-just-ordered-major-strikes-against-the-houthis-what-does-this-mean-for-yemen-iran-and-beyond/)

Image: Flames and smoke rise from the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which has been on fire since August 23, on the Red Sea, August 25, 2024. The Houthis, an armed, Iran-backed group that controls the most populous parts of Yemen, have carried out dozens of attacks against ships in the Red Sea since November 2023, causing disruptions to global shipping.

“Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114167864888304754)
 on Truth Social.

Trump went on to [emphasize](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-piles-pressure-yemens-houthis-with-new-airstrikes-2025-03-17/)
 that Iran would be held responsible for any future Houthi attacks: “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!”

The US president is right that Iran plays a large role in supporting the Houthis. Russia, too, is an important backer of the group.

Back in October 2024, the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-provided-targeting-data-for-houthi-assault-on-global-shipping-eabc2c2b)
 that Russia was providing targeting data to the Houthis, which they then used while attacking Western ships. In the fall of 2024, Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout was reportedly [attempting](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putins-merchant-of-death-is-back-in-the-arms-business-this-time-selling-to-the-houthis-10b7f521?mod=article_inline)
 to broker the sale of around ten million dollars’ worth of automatic small arms to the group. Iran was also [arbitrating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
 secret talks between Russia and the Houthis for transfers of anti-ship missiles to the militants."

===================================================================

New attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on cargo ships in the Red Sea have raised fears of a renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route for international trade

ByJON GAMBRELL Associated Press

July 8, 2025, 4:36 AM

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An attack by [Yemen’s Houthi rebels](https://apnews.com/hub/houthis)
 on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea killed three mariners and wounded two others, a European Union naval force said Tuesday, highlighting the danger of the group's [renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 for international trade.

The [attack on the Greek-owned Eternity C](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-houthis-israel-15edf75586540201f63b7c33348fb737)
 follows the Iranian-backed Houthis [attacking another vessel, the bulk carrier Magic Seas](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-ship-attacked-2f10bed442ebca4aa026b5dc67a05b76)
, on Sunday in the Red Sea that they said subsequently sank. The Houthis released a similar video after [their attack on the tanker Sounion in August 2024](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attack-sounion-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-76c68f18a984d18905ce7c84e5cabe0c)
.

The attack on the Magic Seas drew international criticism.

“It is the first such attack against a commercial vessel in 2025, a serious escalation endangering maritime security in a vital waterway for the region and the world,” the EU warned. The assaults are the first Houthi attacks on shipping since late 2024 on the waterway that had begun to see more ships pass through in recent weeks.

“We haven’t seen any real attacks on merchant shipping since December last year," said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. President Donald Trump’s administration [targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-278d07bc5aad75bb32e57f99a78cbe88)
.

The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following [U.S. The Houthis apparently targeted the two vessels over their companies running routes to Israel.

“If I were to venture, I guess it has to do with Netanyahu being in Washington and with the fact that, of, course, Iran and its network of allies has been taking a bit of a beating in the last couple of months,” Paes said.

The Houthis have been launching [missile and drone attacks](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c)

 Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and [killing four sailors](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba)
. then launched a broad assault against the rebels that [ended weeks later](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 when Trump said the rebels pledged to stop attacking ships.

Since then, the Houthis have continued occasional [missile attacks targeting Israel](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-gaza-aid-ship-attacks-0da6c2453fe2c4e5f81923c84c7d3f3a)
. The EU Operation Aspides and the private security firm Ambrey both reported those details.

While the Houthis haven't claimed the attack — they can take days to claim one — Yemen's exiled government and the EU force blamed the rebels, as did the U.S. State Department.

“These attacks demonstrate the ongoing threat that Iran-backed Houthi rebels pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. They can negatively impact the already [dire humanitarian situation](https://apnews.com/video/humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen-displacement-camps-worsens-after-wfp-halts-food-distribution-2fd6c11ad61d4047868648fb921c8b11)
 in Yemen.”

The United Nations condemned the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea and called on the rebels to comply with U.N. The Philippines said 17 Filipinos were on the Magic Seas and another 21 on the Eternity C.

The two attacks, and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday targeting the rebels, raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S."

Background
----------

### Houthis within Yemen

The Houthi movement is an [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
\-backed [Zaydi](/wiki/Zaydism "Zaydism")
 [Shia Islamist](/wiki/Shia_Islamism "Shia Islamism")
 militant organization that exercises _de facto_ control over parts of [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
, though it is not the country's internationally recognized government; the [Houthi takeover in Yemen](/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen "Houthi takeover in Yemen")
 in 2014 resulted in the group's acquisition of the capital city of [Sanaa](/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa")
, but the anti-Houthi [Presidential Leadership Council](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
 remains recognized by the international community as Yemen's legitimate government.[\[98\]](#cite_note-106)
 After this conflict grew into an ongoing [civil war](/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)")
, millions of residents were internally displaced, and a Saudi-led coalition responded by imposing a [blockade](/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen "Blockade of Yemen")
 of Yemen. Anyone who can do that can easily deny the connection between what is happening in the Red Sea and Gaza."[\[201\]](#cite_note-209)

### Operation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition

While the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them.[\[202\]](#cite_note-210)
[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 region.[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 The operation, codenamed [Operation Prosperity Guardian](/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian "Operation Prosperity Guardian")
,[\[204\]](#cite_note-212)
 was formally launched on 23 December 2023.[\[174\]](#cite_note-Gronholt-pedersen-182)
 It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf")
 and [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")
 during the "[Tanker War](/wiki/Tanker_War "Tanker War")
" of the 1980s,[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 and the ongoing maritime security operations of [Combined Task Force 153](/wiki/Combined_Task_Force_153 "Combined Task Force 153")
, the US Navy-led task force based in [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain")
.[\[162\]](#cite_note-Wintour2023-170)
 The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat [Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa](/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia")
, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats.[\[205\]](#cite_note-213)

#### Independent naval patrols for maritime security

France, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the [French frigate _Languedoc_](/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc "French frigate Languedoc")
 intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate [_Virginio Fasan_](/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_(F_591) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")
 under the Secure Mediterranean operation.[\[16\]](#cite_note-itdec-20)
 India has also sent two [_Kolkata_\-class destroyers](/wiki/Kolkata-class_destroyer "Kolkata-class destroyer")
 to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea.[\[20\]](#cite_note-HT19dec-24)

### Pro-Palestinian protests

Main article: [Gaza war protests](/wiki/Gaza_war_protests "Gaza war protests")

In mid-January 2024, reports indicated that pro-Palestinian demonstrators in London voiced support for Houthi militants."

Content: "“The house was rocked, and the windows were shattered,” he told the AP by phone.

The Houthis have launched missiles and drones toward Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea for over 22 months, saying they are attacking in solidarity with Palestinians amid the war in Gaza.

Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, claimed the latest airstrikes won’t deter the rebels, and vowed to continue attacks on Israel.

“Our military operations supporting Gaza won’t stop, God willing, unless the aggression is stopped, and the siege is lifted,” he wrote on social media.

The Israeli strikes were the first to hit Yemen since a week ago, when Israel said it targeted energy infrastructure it believed was used by the rebels.

The latest strikes follow the Houthis’ claim of launching a newly equipped missile toward Israel on Friday, including targeting the country’s largest airport, Ben Gurion. [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/ "PBS News")

Israeli strikes hit Yemen’s capital, days after Houthi rebels fired cluster munitions at Israel
===============================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Aug 24, 2025 11:54 AM EDT

CAIRO (AP) — Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s capital on Sunday, just days after the Houthi rebels fired a missile toward Israel that its military described as the first cluster bomb the rebels had fired at it since 2023.

The Iranian-backed Houthis said the strikes hit multiple areas across Sanaa. The Houthi-run health ministry said that at least two people were killed and 35 others were wounded.

The rebels’ Al-Masirah satellite television reported a strike on an oil company, and video on social media showed a fireball erupting there.

Israel’s military said it struck the Asar and Hizaz power plants, calling them “a significant electricity supply facility for military activities,” along with a military site where the presidential palace is located.

Sanaa residents told The Associated Press they heard loud explosions close to a closed military academy and the presidential palace. The rebels stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in Gaza and later became the target of a weekslong airstrike campaign ordered by U.S. Israel’s military said it fragmented mid-air after several interception attempts.

An Israeli Air Force official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, called the projectile fired on Friday a new threat. It was a cluster munition, he said, meant to detonate into multiple explosives on impact.

The use of cluster bombs makes Israeli interception more difficult and represents additional technology provided to the Houthis by Iran, the official asserted.

The official said over 10 Israeli fighter jets carried out Sunday’s strikes.

Houthi attacks over the past two years have upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passes each year.

From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones."

For their part, the Houthis are eager to reach an agreement with Saudi Arabia to establish themselves as the dominant political and military force in Yemen. Therefore, while the Saudi-Houthi dialogue is a critical step toward peace, it is only one part of a much larger and more intricate puzzle that must be pieced together to achieve lasting stability in Yemen.

On April 1, 2022, the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Hans Grundberg, announced a [two-month truce](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/1/yemens-warring-parties-agree-to-two-month-truce-un-says)
 between the country’s warring parties. Communication channels between Saudi Arabia and the Houthi rebels remained open, leading to an April 2023 [visit](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/10/1168923083/saudi-officials-visit-yemens-capital-for-talks-with-rebels)
 by Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed Al-Jaber, to Sanaa. In response, the United States and its western allies [launched](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-coalition-strikes-in-houthi-controlled-areas-in-yemen/)
 Operation “Prosperity Guardian” in December 2023 to counter Houthi actions. Israel [retaliated](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/20/airstrikes-hit-yemens-hodeidah-port-after-israel-vows-revenge-for-houthi-attack)
 with an airstrike on the Yemeni port of Hodeidah, prompting the Houthis to vow revenge.

Amid these developments, tensions heightened further in July 2024 after the Central Bank of Yemen, now based in Aden, ordered Yemeni banks to [relocate](https://www.mofa-ye.org/Pages/26808/)
 their headquarters from Sanaa within 60 days and [revoked](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2547986/middle-east)
 the licenses of six banks headquartered there. The Houthis perceived this as a move orchestrated by Saudi Arabia and [threatened](https://www.newarab.com/news/houthis-threaten-riyadh-aerial-footage-key-airports)
 to strike Saudi airports and key facilities in retaliation, even releasing video footage of the threatened airports.

On July 23, 2024, an economic [de-escalation agreement](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5043196-de-escalation-agreement-between-yemen-govt-houthis-paves-way-economic-talks)
 was announced between Yemen’s internationally recognized government in Aden and the Houthi group, which involved ending measures against banks and an increase in the number of flights from Sanaa Airport. Media reports suggested that Saudi Arabia [urged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-26/saudi-arabia-strives-to-avoid-renewed-war-with-yemen-s-houthis)
 the Aden government to de-escalate and reverse the banking measures. Having proven their mettle in war and developed their military strength, the Houthis seek recognition as the primary and legitimate representative of the Yemeni people."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from the Atlantic Council, published on March 18, 2025, discusses the US approach toward the Houthis, mentioning that Donald Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 15, 2025, and that Russia has aided Houthi operations (<image:635>, <image:637>, <image:638>). An ABC News article from July 8, 2025, reports that Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea in July 2025, after ceasing attacks in late 2024 following US airstrikes. The article also mentions occasional missile attacks targeting Israel.

A Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions the 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and the 2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel, the 2024 Israeli attacks on Yemen, and the March–May 2025 United States attacks in Yemen. It also mentions that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. Instead, the Houthis continued attacks, including targeting ships and launching missiles. The evidence also shows that the US, under Trump, ordered airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2025. A ceasefire between the US and the Houthis was brokered on May 6, 2025. However, the Houthis resumed attacks in July 2025.

The claim is therefore demonstrably false.

Spigel Sohmer senior partner Neil Oberman has served Mayor Valérie Plante by bailiff regarding electronic signs normally used in construction areas that were used by pro-Palestinian activists to convey anti-Israel hate messages.

Oberman, who is also the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, is acting on behalf of Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi, who, amongst others, called attention to the road construction signs, which say "Free Palestine. The hate propaganda is a by-product of your inaction."

Oberman wrote that his client, Levi, "contends that your negligence has enabled the spread of hate and violence on the island of Montreal, which is targeted against the citizens of Montreal."

The letter demands that Plante:

• Launch a "full investigation into the hate propaganda and that the same be made public."

• "Issue a letter of apology to the residents of Hampstead."

• Reveal "what measures \[will be taken\] so that hate is not supported nor tolerated by the City of Montreal and/or the use of its assets to do the same."

• "Confirm that the City of Montreal will investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the hate propaganda without delay." Otherwise, "our client will take the appropriate steps in law to safeguard the interests of his residents."

Police are investigating the incident, credit for which was claimed by a group called Clash MTL. Oberman's letter, copied to Plante's Special Counsel Jimmy Zoubris and Montreal police chief Fady Dagher, says the electronic signs were used to call for violence and convey radical political messages.

The lawyer reminded Plante that this past February, he wrote to her on behalf of concerned citizens "regarding your administration's failure to act against the unlawful assemblies, aggression and violence that have infested the city of Montreal. Escalate Now" and "Globalize the Intifada."

"I refuse to stand by and watch my city descend into chaos and anarchy," Levi posted on X.The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs posted, "after 10 months of escalating anti-Jewish hate and glorification of violence, Montrealers deserve to feel safe and protected in their city. Montreal is denying responsibility, saying the signs belong to a private contractor. "Your inaction in this regard accomplished nothing other than to promote anarchy and the erosion of the rule of law in Montreal. Your inaction and incompetence have allowed anarchy to spread and damage the reputation and security of Montreal, Quebec and Canada."

Graphic assembled by The Maple staff.

The City of Montreal is facing legal action after its employees were caught on camera tearing down pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election.

The signs belonged to LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), which is legally [registered](https://www.elections.ca/WPAPPS/WPR/EN/TP?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a third-party campaign group in the upcoming LaSalle—Émard—Verdun by-election, taking place on September 16.

The incident is the third time since 2008 that the City of Montreal inappropriately removed election signs belonging to Palestine solidarity groups and pro-Palestine political parties, raising questions about why such signs are being targeted.

LEV4P sent a cease and desist letter to the City on August 2. He pointed out that the City was [ordered](https://thecjn.ca/news/bds-group-awarded-damages-for-election-poster-removal/?ref=readthemaple.com)
 to pay $12,860 in punitive damages in 2018 for a similar incident involving pro-Palestine signs displayed by registered groups back in 2015.

“There’s no more good faith argument when it’s the third time, and when you’ve had a judge severely criticize you for this,” said Johnson.

LEV4P raised and spent approximately $3,000 on the signs, and those torn down by City workers on camera represented only a fraction of those that were distributed throughout the riding — before they were taken down. 

The signs highlighted Canada’s complicity in Israel’s war on Gaza, which is being [examined](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a case of genocide at the International Court of Justice, as well as more generic slogans calling for a free Palestine.

After the City admitted removing some of the signs, it returned 95 signs out of a total of 450. Johnson said that his clients could not simply replace the signs before getting them back from the City since they would be in danger of exceeding third-party spending limits.

In his view, this means the damage has already been done to the democratic process.

“This new violation which the City of Montreal has committed is so serious, and the effect that it can have is a sort of chilling effect,” Johnson explained. 

“That’s the danger when public authorities intervene to limit freedom of speech: It can undermine people’s confidence in our democracy. “I don’t think that is a defence that will hold up in court.”

In an emailed statement sent in French and translated into English by The Maple using an online tool, the City of Montreal said it would not comment on the matter due to the possibility of legal action.

“The City confirms having received a copy of the formal notice from the Lasalle-Émard-Verdun organization for Palestine,” the City said. “To me, it is motivated by the message on our signs.”

Canada’s role in Israel’s war on Gaza has proven to be a potent issue in the upcoming by-election, which was triggered following the resignation of Liberal MP and justice minister David Lametti in January.

Last week, CBC News [reported](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-staffers-gaza-montreal-byelection-1.7306984?ref=readthemaple.com)
 that 52 Arab and Muslim staffers in the Liberal government signed a letter saying they would not participate in the by-election campaign due to Justin Trudeau’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

“We can no longer in good conscience campaign for a party that excludes us and our values,” CBC quoted the letter as reading.

The staffers’ demands included “explicitly condemning Israel for its numerous war crimes and for the genocidal rhetoric from members of the Israeli Cabinet,” recognizing the State of Palestine, and revoking all existing permits for arms exports to Israel, including those that are [shipped](https://www.readthemaple.com/u-s-names-quebec-contractor-in-newly-approved-arms-sale-to-israel/)

### **Repeated Incidents**

The first time the City [removed](https://canadiandimension.com/blog/view/westmount-on-warpath-against-communist-candidates-election-posters?ref=readthemaple.com)
 pro-Palestine election signs was in 2008, when municipal authorities removed signs belonging to the Communist Party of Canada candidate Bill Sloan in the Westmount neighbourhood.

Following that incident, municipal authorities signed an agreement with Elections Canada to not allow such an infringement to occur again, according to Johnson. 

The second incident occurred in 2015, when the Communist Party and a third-party group promoting Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel put up signs denouncing Israel’s human rights violations and occupation of Palestine.

As with the incident in this year’s by-election, in 2015 the City claimed the removals were good faith errors made due to the disturbing imagery on some of the signs, which depicted the body of a Palestinian boy killed by the Israeli military in Gaza.

The two groups took the City to court, which ruled that the City had intentionally violated the fundamental rights of the citizens who displayed the signs, according to Johnson. To his knowledge, none of the coalition’s signs were removed by the City of Montreal.

“Our clients are very justified in having some very serious questions about the motivation of the city in taking down these posters,” said Johnson."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image is likely from Montreal, Canada, and shows a traffic sign displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." The web search results indicate that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante has been involved in discussions and actions related to pro-Palestinian signs, including the removal of some signs. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Mayor Plante authorized the sign in the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image is from Montreal and displays the message. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not directly supported by the evidence.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:13>)
web_search("Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante Free Palestine")
image_search("Free Palestine sign Montreal")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Suburban published an article about Mayor Valérie Plante being served by bailiff regarding pro-Palestinian electronic signs that displayed messages like "Free Palestine. Escalate now" (<image:10100>). The signs were criticized for conveying anti-Israel messages and were brought to the attention of the authorities by Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi. The Maple reported on the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs, and that the city is facing legal action. The article also mentions that Jeremy Levi called on Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante to "take a stand and restore order in our city" regarding the signs (<image:13>). CTV News reported that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante held a news conference to comment on pro-Palestinian protests (<image:10102>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Globe and Mail reported on a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now" (<image:7473>). Another source shows a building in Montreal with a Palestine flag and the slogan "Palestine Libre" painted on the brick walls (<image:7474>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely from Montreal, Canada, and shows a traffic sign displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." The web search results indicate that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante has been involved in discussions and actions related to pro-Palestinian signs, including the removal of some signs. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Mayor Plante authorized the sign in the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image is from Montreal and displays the message. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not directly supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is from Montreal and shows a traffic sign with the message "Free Palestine. Escalate now." While the mayor of Montreal, Valérie Plante, has been involved in discussions and actions related to pro-Palestinian signs, there is no evidence that she authorized the specific sign in the image.

`false`

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Washington CNN  — 

During her [first official White House briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/media/karoline-leavitt-first-press-conference/index.html)
 as President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had prevented a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Trump’s team, [she said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-january-28-2025/)
, used the president’s [pause on foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-impact/index.html)
 to thwart a plan in which “there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”

Leavitt’s Tuesday comments made headlines around the world. And when CNN asked Leavitt and her colleagues for any evidence, another White House official instead pointed us to comments from the State Department — comments that, as we’ll discuss below, did not even repeat Leavitt’s claim of a planned $50 million Gaza condom expenditure, let alone prove the claim.

**In three previous years under Biden, USAID spent _no_ money on condoms in the entire Middle East**: A detailed [federal report published last year](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 said USAID did not provide or fund _any_ condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

The report, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-executive-orders-transgender-troops-dei-covid-us-politics-live?page=with:block-679977268f086189f840e07b#block-679977268f086189f840e07b)
 by The Guardian on Tuesday, said the only Middle East contraceptives provided or funded by USAID during that three-year period went to the country of Jordan in fiscal 2023. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.” She did not specify how much of the $102 million in funding was intended for contraception, let alone for condoms in particular.

In an email to reporters earlier Tuesday, Bruce said the entity that was supposed to get $102 million is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that [operates two field hospitals in Gaza](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/gaza/)
.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, International Medical Corps said that it has received about $68 million from the US Agency for International Development for Gaza operations since October 7, 2023, the day of Hamas’ major attack on Israel. And the president himself told an even more dramatic version of the story in a speech on Wednesday, saying that “we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

But there are at least five big reasons to be skeptical that the story is true.

**The White House offered no evidence for the story**: Leavitt provided no proof for her claim that there was ever a federal plan to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza. This was “a small order of injectables and progestin-only contraceptive pills” totaling about $46,000.

**Total worldwide USAID condom spending is far less than $50 million**: In the 2023 fiscal year, USAID provided or funded a global total of about $7.1 million worth of male condoms and about $1.1 million worth of female condoms, overwhelmingly to countries in Africa, according to the federal report.

In other words, Leavitt was essentially claiming Tuesday that the Biden administration had decided to provide more than six times the 2023 worldwide value of condoms to a single tiny territory that has [about 2.1 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html)
 and that is in a region that usually does not receive condoms from the US.

A former senior Biden official who worked on Gaza aid issues told CNN that Leavitt’s story about a $50 million condom expenditure for Gaza was “imaginary.” The former official said: “It’s a lie, they are making s\*\*\* up.”

**The State Department would not repeat Leavitt’s claim**: The White House official pointed to a series of social media posts from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who listed specific examples of how Trump’s aid pause had prevented what Bruce called unjustified spending that wouldn’t make the country “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

But Bruce did not mention $50 million for condoms in Gaza.

Instead, Bruce was vague about how much condom spending was supposedly stopped. While International Medical Corps has [publicly discussed](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story/youre-pregnant-in-gaza-what-happens-next/)
 its reproductive and sexual health services in Gaza, among various other services from cardiology to orthopedics, the organization said in the Wednesday statement that “no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

The organization said the US funding has paid for the two hospitals’ “lifesaving medical care” for roughly 33,000 civilians per month. Like Bruce’s Tuesday social media posts and email to reporters, this Wednesday statement did not repeat Leavitt’s claim that there was $50 million in planned funding for condoms in particular; it provided no dollar figure at all for condoms.

**Experts expressed doubt about Leavitt’s story — or simply called it wrong**: Experts on US aid to Gaza and global health aid were baffled by the claim that the US had been planning to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza.

“We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” said Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, an aid nonprofit that has partnered with USAID on a [five-year, $50 million health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
.

Fake said this Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms” and added: “Our whole program is $50 (million) and represents a significant portion of total US aid going to Gaza.”

[Matthew Kavanagh](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/experts/matthew-m-kavanagh/)
, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said that after doing some digging into Leavitt’s claim, “It seems clear to me there was no $50 million in condoms going to Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Fact check: $50 million for condoms in Gaza? [She wrote](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
: “Example 1: Condoms. Trump’s freeze, the organization said, halts US funding for hospital services like performing about 30 lifesaving surgeries per day, delivering about 20 babies per day, running an emergency room receiving up to 200 patients per day, and operating one of Gaza’s only neonatal intensive care units and only stabilization centers for severely malnourished children.

“If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,” the organization said.

A State Department official issued an additional statement to CNN on Wednesday that asserted that the funding Trump had stopped from going to the International Medical Corps “included” funds for family planning, emergency contraceptives and prevention of sexually transmitted infections."

The claim was first announced by White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt in her first press briefing, saying the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had found “that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.” However, the administration provided no evidence to support the assertion.

**WASHINGTON**

Billionaire Elon Musk backtracked Tuesday on his claim that the US had been intending to send $50 million worth of condoms to the Gaza Strip.

“First of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” Musk told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about fact-checking reports that million of dollars were actually earmarked towards the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in Gaza province of Mozambique.

“We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes," he said.

"I’m not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere. And that is really an enormous number of condoms," Musk continued.

"If it went to Mozambique instead of Gaza…okay, that's not as bad. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

,” Leavitt claimed. Trump repeats false claim that US sends condoms to Gaza
========================================================================

This article is more than 6 months old

Claim was first made in press conference, prompting Fox host to say condoms were also being used to bomb Israel

Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Donald Trump [boasted](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1884683756172435967)
 that his administration had “stopped $50m being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas”, doubling down on a claim first made by his press secretary which appears to be contradicted by the facts.

As the Guardian reported on Tuesday, [a comprehensive report](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 issued in September by the US Agency for International Development (USAid), not a penny of the $60.8m in contraceptive and condom shipments funded by the US in the past year went to [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.”

[skip past newsletter promotion](#EmailSignup-skip-link-11)

after newsletter promotion

Bruce [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check/index.html)
 the contractor that was supposed to get $102m is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that operates two field hospitals in Gaza. “That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So that’s what this pause is focused on: being good stewards of tax dollars.”

While Leavitt did not offer any evidence to support this claim, and did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the Guardian, the idea that the United States government planned to spend $50m to send condoms to Gaza quickly went viral, with an assist [from Musk](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884326482161590294)
 himself.

The Fox pundit Jesse Watters even [claimed](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1884367346011365561)
 that the condoms were being used by Hamas militants as balloons to float explosives into Israel.

A review of the available evidence, however, suggests that the claim is almost certainly not true.

For the financial year 2023, the most recent for which data is available, only about $7m worth of condoms were distributed globally by USAid, and the vast majority of family-planning funds, 89%, were spent on programs in Africa.

No USAid funding for family planning was budgeted for Gaza.

In a thread on Musk’s social-media platform X, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce [cited](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
, as “Example 1” of “unjustified and non-emergency spending” that had been blocked: “Condoms. But the International Medical Corps posted [a statement](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/press-release/international-medical-corps-operations-in-gaza/)
 on its website detailing its emergency work in Gaza with this clear denial: “No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

CNN also reported that experts on US aid to Gaza were baffled by the claim. “We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, a non-profit that has partnered with USAid on a [five-year, $50m health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
 told the broadcaster.

Fake added that the Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms”.

As Dan Evon of the non-profit News Literacy Project [pointed out](https://x.com/danieljevon/status/1884350732813455533)
 in a comment on the USAid funding for family planning in other parts of the world: “It’s also worth noting that this is not a Biden program. Trump repeats false claim that US sends condoms to Gaza&body=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-condoms-gaza?CMP=share_btn_url)

The claim is partially supported and partially refuted by the evidence. The Guardian reports that the claim originated from the White House press secretary, citing research from DOGE and OMB. However, the same article also mentions that USAID spent no money on condoms in Gaza. The evidence suggests that while the claim was made, it is not supported by USAID spending records.

(<image:1>) [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/)


## Elaboration
The claim is contradicted by the evidence. CNN fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it, with USAID having spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the previous three years. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim, stating the funds were intended for Mozambique, not Gaza. The Washington Post analysis by Glenn Kessler, however, states that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza.

The evidence presents conflicting information. While CNN and Musk's retraction cast doubt on the claim, the Washington Post analysis suggests the opposite.

More information is needed to determine the veracity of the claim. Specifically, the basis for the Washington Post's analysis and the specifics of the DOGE and OMB findings are required to resolve the contradiction.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/trump-condoms-gaza): 
Content: The Guardian reports that the claim originated from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing research from Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The article states that Doge and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. The Guardian also mentions that a comprehensive report issued by USAID shows that no money was spent on condoms in Gaza. The article was published on January 29, 2025. <image:10158>


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported and partially refuted by the evidence. The Guardian reports that the claim originated from the White House press secretary, citing research from DOGE and OMB. However, the same article also mentions that USAID spent no money on condoms in Gaza. The evidence suggests that while the claim was made, it is not supported by USAID spending records.

Addis Ababa, April 2, 2025 (ENA) --- Israel is committed to strengthening economic and social ties with Ethiopia, Ambassador Abraham Negussie said.

In an exclusive interview with ENA, the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie emphasized that the current relationship between Israel and Ethiopia is grounded in practicality and modernization, with both countries actively working to strengthen their bonds.

The ambassador noted Israel's remarkable economic transformation over the past 70 years, stating the country's transition from arid landscapes to fertile fields, a strong economy, and a unified society some among others. He expressed Israel's desire to share these valuable experiences with Ethiopia.

He emphasized that the Israel-Ethiopia partnership is built on mutual interests, benefiting both nations and their people, and is especially important given the region's volatility.

Pointing out Israel’s keen interest in collaborating with Ethiopia in sectors such as agriculture, health, mining, and innovative technologies, he observed that many Israelis are already working in these vital areas to support Ethiopia's development.

“This is why so many non-governmental organizations are coming to Ethiopia to assist in agriculture, health, mining, and technology,” the ambassador added.

Ambassador Abraham further stressed that this bilateral cooperation, rooted in shared interests, has the potential to introduce modern agricultural practices, health innovations, and digital ecosystems in Ethiopia.

These efforts could drive economic reform, positioning Ethiopia as a leading nation in Africa while also benefiting Israel from the progress, according to the Ambassador.

The ambassador also emphasized the significance of economic agreements, particularly in sectors like renewable energy, water management, and irrigation systems, noting Israel’s eagerness to implement its advanced irrigation techniques in Ethiopia.

He mentioned that he has observed modern agricultural practices across the nation including Amhara, Tigray, and Oromia. 

While acknowledging the progress made, the Ambassador also recognized the need for continued improvement and strengthening the systems.

During the reign of Emperor [Haile Selassie](/wiki/Haile_Selassie "Haile Selassie")
, Israeli advisers trained paratroops and counterinsurgency units belonging to the [Fifth Division](/w/index.php?title=Ethiopian_5_Division&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ethiopian 5 Division (page does not exist)")
 (also called the Nebelbal, 'Flame', Division).[\[6\]](#cite_note-stud-6)
 In December 1960, elements of the Ethiopian [army attempted a coup](/wiki/1960_Ethiopian_coup_attempt "1960 Ethiopian coup attempt")
 whilst the emperor was on a state visit in [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil "Brazil")
. Beginning in 1959, Israel prioritized the establishment of strong ties with Ethiopia, investing significant resources into this relationship. Even before formal diplomatic relations were established, Israel had already made substantial contributions to Ethiopia in areas such as training, knowledge-sharing, and infrastructure development.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

Throughout the 1960s, many of Israel’s senior military and security officials visited Ethiopia, underscoring the importance of the relationship. During a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister [Moshe Dayan](/wiki/Moshe_Dayan "Moshe Dayan")
, Haile Selassie asserted that the Somali nationalist aspiration for a [Greater Somalia](/wiki/Greater_Somalia "Greater Somalia")
 was driven by [Nasserite](/wiki/Nasserism "Nasserism")
 agitation and went so far as to express hope that Somalia itself should be annexed by Ethiopia.[\[13\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEErlich201475-13)
 High-ranking Israeli police officials helped establish special border police forces in the Ogaden.[\[14\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEErlich201480-14)

 (PLO) was training the Somali guerrillas.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)

Parallel to the conflicts in Eritrea and Ogaden, Israel was also accused of aiding the Ethiopian government in crushing the [Oromo](/wiki/Oromo_language "Oromo language")

In 1969 the Israeli government had proposed the formation of an anti-[Pan-Arab](/wiki/Pan-Arabism "Pan-Arabism")
 alliance consisting of the United States, Israel, Ethiopia, Iran and Turkey. At the summit the [Algerian](/wiki/Algeria "Algeria")
 president [Houari Boumediène](/wiki/Houari_Boumedi%C3%A8ne "Houari Boumediène")
 called on Ethiopia to break its relations with Israel. The Benghazi meeting condemned Ethiopian-Israeli cooperation, and pledged support for the ELF.[\[17\]](#cite_note-spen-17)
[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)

Ethiopian Prime Minister [Aklilu Habte-Wold](/wiki/Aklilu_Habte-Wold "Aklilu Habte-Wold")
 began seeking political support for breaking relations with Israel after the OAU summit. While Ethiopia had historically been significant to Islam, its ties with Israel were of particular concern to the Arab world, which deemed it crucial for those relations to end. He retreated to his room and refrained from appearing in public for several days.[\[21\]](#cite_note-21)

Even after Ethiopia broke diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973, Israeli military aid continued after the [Derg](/wiki/Derg "Derg")
 military junta came to power and included spare parts and ammunition for U.S.-made weapons and service for U.S.-made F-5 jet fighters.[\[6\]](#cite_note-stud-6)
 Israel also maintained a small group of military advisers in Addis Ababa.[\[6\]](#cite_note-stud-6)

During the [Ogaden War](/wiki/Ogaden_War "Ogaden War")
, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs [Moshe Dayan](/wiki/Moshe_Dayan "Moshe Dayan")
 publicly acknowledged that Israel had been providing security assistance and arms to Ethiopia. [Mengistu Haile Mariam](/wiki/Mengistu_Haile_Mariam "Mengistu Haile Mariam")
 expelled all Israelis so that he might preserve his relationship with radical Arab states such as [Libya](/wiki/Libya "Libya")
 and [South Yemen](/wiki/South_Yemen "South Yemen")
.[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-stud-6)
 Mengistu had sought Israeli support during the war even though the Soviets and Cubans were uncomfortable with their presence in Ethiopia.[\[23\]](#cite_note-23)

Although respectively Addis Ababa claimed it had terminated its military relationship with Israel, military cooperation continued."

Content: "The examples referenced within the definition of antisemitism include: 

*   Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. 
*   Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. 
*   Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. 
*   Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). 
*   Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. 
*   Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.   
    
*   Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.   
    
*   Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.   
    
*   Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.   
    
*   Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.   
    
*   Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

Defining Antisemitism

Working Definition Of Antisemitism

*   [IHRA and Roma genocide remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance)
    

On 26 May 2016, the IHRA Plenary adopted its [Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
, which declares: 

“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” 

The definition of antisemitism was originally drafted with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which worked with several prominent Jewish organizations to draft a comprehensive definition of antisemitism. However, in 2009 EUMC was replaced by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which decided that it would not provide a definition to any form of prejudice, including antisemitism. 

Explaining the decision, then-IHRA Chair, Romanian Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, [stated](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/AntiSemitism/Pages/The-IHRA-adopts-working-definition-of-antiemitism-2-June-2016.aspx)
, “All IHRA Member Countries share the concern that incidents of antisemitism are steadily rising and agree that the IHRA’s Member Countries and indeed the IHRA’s experts need political tools with which to fight this scourge. The IHRA’s 31 member countries -- 24 of which are EU member countries -- are committed to the Stockholm Declaration and thereby to fighting the evil of antisemitism through coordinated international political action.” 

The definition includes a list of eleven reference [examples](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
 to aid the identification of antisemitism. Universities, municipalities, religious groups and even sports clubs are among the bodies that have formally adopted the definition thus far. 

The UN Member States that have formally endorsed or adopted IHRA Working definition of antisemitism include:

!Ihra countries <image:10166>

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also been a strong advocate for adopting a universal definition of antisemitism, saying, “Such a definition can serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.”

#### Working Definition Of Holocaust Denial And Distortion](/en/working-definition-of-holocaust-denial-and-distortion)

[Next\
\
#### IHRA and Roma Genocide Remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance) Some critics of the definition have claimed that by including within its examples references to Israel, it unfairly labels detractors of Israeli policy as antisemites. Defenders of the definition argue that the wording leaves room for vigorous criticism of Israel’s government as it states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” and that it is a non-legally binding definition, intended to guide and educate without limiting debate or free speech."

**Antisemitic acts are criminal** when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

**Criminal acts are antisemitic** when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.

**Antisemitic discrimination** is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.

On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:

> **Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:**
> 
> **“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. <image:10168>

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why was the IHRA working definition of antisemitism developed?

The IHRA is the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues. Following the example of the working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion (2013), the IHRA’s experts set out to adopt a similar tool to help guide the organization’s work on combating antisemitism.

How did the IHRA adopt the working definition of antisemitism?

The experts in the IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial built international consensus around a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which was then adopted by the Plenary, the IHRA’s decision-making body made up of representatives from all IHRA Member Countries. This practical tool has also been formally adopted or endorsed\* by these groups, both at the national and organizational level.

*   [Special Rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/ActionPlanChanges-May2022.pdf)
     recommended that governments use the IHRA working definition of antisemitism as a non-legally binding educational and training tool and ensure it is incorporated, together with relevant human rights standards-based guidance on protecting freedom of opinion and expression, into training and educational materials for all public officials, such as police, prosecutors, and judges, government employees, educators, and national human rights institutions, and integrated into diversity inclusion programs.

### European Union

*   [Council](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2018/12/06/fight-against-antisemitism-council-declaration/)

     called on Member States that had not done so already to endorse the non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism employed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as a useful guidance tool in education and training, including for law enforcement authorities in their efforts to identify and investigate antisemitic attacks more efficiently and effectively.
*   Commission highlighted the working definition of antisemitism by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance as the benchmark for developing a victim-centered approach and urged for its adoption.

### Organization of American States

 According to [Neve Gordon](/wiki/Neve_Gordon "Neve Gordon")
, Facebook responded by saying its definition "draws on the spirit—and the text—of the IHRA" working definition but demonstrated reluctance to adopt the examples that relate to Israel, and critics of the IHRA-WDA also lobbied the company not to adopt it.[\[103\]](#cite_note-Gordon_2020-107)

#### Europe

In late 2016, [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia")
 blocked the [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe")
's adoption of the IHRA-WDA.[\[123\]](#cite_note-127)
 The European Parliament called for member states to adopt the IHRA-WDA on 1 June 2017[\[124\]](#cite_note-128)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-Factsheet-125)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-129)
 – although Lerman notes that this is without explicitly quoting the examples.[\[94\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELerman2018b-98)

##### United Kingdom

In March 2016, [Eric Pickles](/wiki/Eric_Pickles "Eric Pickles")
, then [Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Communities_and_Local_Government "Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government")
, recommended the EUMC working definition of antisemitism, as used by the UK's [College of Policing](/wiki/College_of_Policing "College of Policing")
.[\[126\]](#cite_note-130)
 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons [Home Affairs Select Committee](/wiki/Home_Affairs_Select_Committee "Home Affairs Select Committee")
 published a report on antisemitism in the UK, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the IHRA-WDA as "helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose", as well as some of the criticisms of the definition. [Pro-Israel](/wiki/Pro-Israel "Pro-Israel")
 organizations have been advocates for the worldwide legal adoption of the IHRA working definition.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Penslar_2022_pp._133–145-12)

It has been described as an example of a [persuasive definition](/wiki/Persuasive_definition "Persuasive definition")
, and as a "prime example of language being both the site of, and stake in, struggles for power".[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The examples relating to Israel have been criticised by academics, including legal scholars, who say that they are often used to [weaponize antisemitism](/wiki/Weaponization_of_antisemitism "Weaponization of antisemitism")
 in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. Marcus writes that the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism used by the EUMC was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness".[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-30)
 The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-154-31)

Following the EUMC report, the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe")
 (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post-[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights](/wiki/Office_for_Democratic_Institutions_and_Human_Rights "Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights")
 (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 According to Marcus, the EUMC scrapped this failed definition of antisemitism, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations.[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015160-33)

### 2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version

Israeli scholar [Dina Porat](/wiki/Dina_Porat "Dina Porat")
, then head of the [Stephen Roth Institute](/wiki/Stephen_Roth_Institute "Stephen Roth Institute")
 at [Tel Aviv University](/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University "Tel Aviv University")
, proposed the idea for a common definition of antisemitism during an NGO conference organized by the [American Jewish Committee](/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee "American Jewish Committee")
 (AJC).[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 [Kenneth S. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding.[\[34\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161-38)

EUMC publication
----------------

### Initial publication

At the suggestion of the AJC, the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 The consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [European Jewish Congress](/wiki/European_Jewish_Congress "European Jewish Congress")
, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.[\[22\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010a-26)
 The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 According to Michael Whine of the [Community Security Trust](/wiki/Community_Security_Trust "Community Security Trust")
, the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism "played an active role in formulating the Working Definition".[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010-40)

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")
 on its website that shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)
 Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".[\[8\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015166–167-9)
 Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership, and "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained".[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)

The stated purpose of the working definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism".[\[38\]](#cite_note-definition-42)
 It said:

> Antisemitism is a certain perception of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews")
> , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."[\[95\]](#cite_note-workdef-99)
 After "taking into account the overall context", the examples of what might constitute antisemitism include claims of [Jewish dual loyalty](/wiki/Antisemitic_tropes#Dual_loyalty "Antisemitic tropes")
,[\[96\]](#cite_note-100)
 and "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor".[\[97\]](#cite_note-101)

### Adoption

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism in the party, leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)
[\[147\]](#cite_note-Jewish_Chronicle-151)
 The UK Delegation to the IHRA said that modifying the IHRA-WDA or not including all 11 examples would mean it "is no longer the IHRA definition", would remove the consistency of having a single definition, and "undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist".[\[154\]](#cite_note-158)

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 unamended examples to the definition of antisemitism; the IHRA-WDA was subsequently added to the party's standing orders by a majority vote of 205 by the [Parliamentary Labour Party](/wiki/Parliamentary_Labour_Party "Parliamentary Labour Party")
.[\[145\]](#cite_note-SabSep18-149)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-159)
[\[156\]](#cite_note-160)

Later in the month, a report by the [Media Reform Coalition](/w/index.php?title=Media_Reform_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Reform Coalition (page does not exist)")
 examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. While the announcement was welcomed by Zionist advocacy groups including [AIJAC](/wiki/AIJAC "AIJAC")
 (the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council) and the [Zionist Federation of Australia](/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Australia "Zionist Federation of Australia")
, the [New Israel Fund](/wiki/New_Israel_Fund "New Israel Fund")
 Australia and Australia Palestine Advocacy Network expressed concerns that the IHRA definition could be used to silence criticism of Israeli policies and actions.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Australia_2021-114)

On 10 July 2025, the first report of Australia's [Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism](/wiki/List_of_combating_antisemitism_envoys#Australia "List of combating antisemitism envoys")
[\[171\]](#cite_note-175)
[\[172\]](#cite_note-176)
 urged adoption of the IHRA working definition and its examples throughout Australian government and society "as best practice for identifying antisemitism". The report was welcomed by some Jewish organizations but criticized by others.[\[173\]](#cite_note-177)
[\[174\]](#cite_note-178)
 It was criticized in several quarters for a chilling of free speech particularly as to Israeli government policies, and a [Trumpian](/wiki/Trumpism "Trumpism")
 threat to the independence of universities and arts organisations.[\[175\]](#cite_note-179)
[\[176\]](#cite_note-180)
[\[177\]](#cite_note-181)
[\[178\]](#cite_note-182)
 Kenneth Stern, the definition's lead drafter, said that it would be a "disaster" for Australia to adopt the proposal to deal with antisemitism mainly by restricting speech.[\[179\]](#cite_note-183)
 The federal government has said that it will respond to the report after receiving a report from the special envoy on islamophobia, due in August, and a final report on racism in universities from the [Australian Human Rights Commission](/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission")
, due in October.[\[180\]](#cite_note-184)

##### New Zealand

On 24 June 2022, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")
 formally became an observer of the IHRA.[\[181\]](#cite_note-185)
 The announcement was welcomed by the [New Zealand Jewish Council](/wiki/New_Zealand_Jewish_Council "New Zealand Jewish Council")
 and the [Holocaust Centre of New Zealand](/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_Centre_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holocaust Centre of New Zealand (page does not exist)")
 as a means of combating racism and antisemitism. In recent years, criticism of the definition has grown with critics arguing that it "primarily targets criticism of Israel and that it has been weaponized against Palestinian activists".[\[195\]](#cite_note-199)

In a statement published on 3 November 2022, 128 scholars, including leading Jewish academics at Israeli, European, United Kingdom and United States universities, said the definition has been "hijacked" and urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition due to its "divisive and polarising" effect.[\[196\]](#cite_note-200)
[\[197\]](#cite_note-201)
 As of 20 April 2023, 104 human and civil rights organisations, including [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
 and the ACLU, also urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition saying in a letter that "The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe."[\[198\]](#cite_note-202)
[\[199\]](#cite_note-203)

Criticism of the examples
-------------------------

### Academic

In March 2005, [Brian Klug](/wiki/Brian_Klug "Brian Klug")
 argued that the definition's examples proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [criticism of Israel](/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel")
, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.[\[200\]](#cite_note-204)

In December 2016, [David Feldman](/wiki/David_Feldman_(historian) "David Feldman (historian)")
 wrote: "I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He also said: "The text also carries dangers. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."[\[203\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlug2018b-207)

Antisemitism
============

Antisemitism, the world’s oldest hatred, is not only still felt around the world, but has been on the rise, as has the frequency of violent attacks.  

Similarly, our International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians (ICJP) forum of Jewish legislators, government ministers, and other elected officials aims to promote dialogue and collaboration between Jewish parliamentarians; to support the principles of democracy, the cause of human rights, and the rule of law; and to combat racism, antisemitism, xenophobia, terrorism, and Holocaust denial by those means available to legislators and government ministers.

**Getting your [Trinity Audio](//trinityaudio.ai)
 player ready...**

_**The following analysis was authored by the Antisemitism Research Center (ARC) by CAM:**_

On February 10th, U.S. Convinced that Jews, Zionists, or the Mossad assassinated President Kennedy, prominent antisemitic influencers such as Jake Shields, Lucas Gage, and Stew Peters framed her involvement as part of a broader Jewish conspiracy to conceal the truth.

Such claims, amplified by bots, quickly reached hundreds of millions internet users, according to a **[new data study](https://combatantisemitism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Manipulating-the-Narrative-Antisemitic-Discourse-and-Inauthentic-Engagement-Targeting-Congresswoman-Anna-Paulina-Luna.pdf)
** carried out by the Cyabra social media analytics firm and published by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), in another disturbing indication of the full extent of the prevalence of antisemitism online today.

**The Formula of Antisemitic Conspiracy Theories**

These individuals now see Luna’s task force as another example of Jewish control over historical narratives. For example, in a recent **[post](https://x.com/jakeshieldsajj/status/1889742996536524900?s=46&t=LMXebXbwXQ6y7VSq3G7x2w)
** on X, Shields shared a photo of Congresswoman Luna and Prime Minister Netanyahu during the latter’s July 2024 address to Congress, and wrote, “This is who is in charge of releasing the JFK files.”

Implicit is the claim that Congresswoman Luna cannot be trusted to lead efforts to declassify files related to the assassination of President Kennedy either because of subservience or fealty to Prime Minister Netanyahu — someone who, presumably, has a direct stake in maintaining the “secrets” of Jewish involvement in the assassination.

In addition, Shields implies that a Jew (or Zionist) always acts in the best interest of their fellow Jews or Zionists, or of Israel, at the expense of others. Invoking “[**dual loyalty**](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/conspiracy-myths/the-myth-of-dual-loyalty)
” portrays the accused as untrustworthy, and in the case of Congresswoman Luna, the purpose of the dual loyalty canard is to preemptively reject any findings she may release that do not assign blame to Jews or Israel for the assassination of President Kennedy.

Both the far-left and the far-right peddle the antisemitic conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is a “Zionist-occupied government,” or “ZOG,” and have invoked ZOG when criticizing Congresswoman Luna and her Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Far-right antisemitic influencer Stew Peters [**asked**](https://x.com/redpillsayian/status/1890234850696888707?s=12)
 rhetorically, “why should we trust a Jewish stripper \[Congresswoman Luna\] to tell us about the crimes of our occupied government.” Meanwhile, the seemingly far-left X account “AIPAC Tracker” **[posted](https://x.com/TrackAIPAC/status/1891914590776168587)
**, “6/7 of the members of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets are in the pocket of the Israel lobby.” Unified by their shared antisemitism in the form of alleging outsize “Zionist” control of the United States, the two ends of the political spectrum seemingly mirror each other, reflecting a phenomenon known as the “[**horseshoe theory**](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/3246)
.”

Not only is Congresswoman Luna allegedly controlled by Zionists, but she is compromised because she is, supposedly, secretly Jewish. These tactics serve to undermine her credibility and reinforce the longstanding antisemitic trope that Jews, or those aligned with them, manipulate governments to serve their interests.

**Instances of Antisemitism Online Targeting Congresswoman Luna:**

Labeling Congresswoman Luna as either a Jew or a Zionist serves the same end: to portray her as compromised and controlled by Jewish or Zionist puppet-masters. In a matter of days, a handful of antisemitic social media accounts can create a false narrative that receives millions of views.

Only by exposing the predictability of their conspiracy theories and their illogical nature can social media users, especially [**younger users**](https://x.com/davidshor/status/1888287606942625864?s=12)
, be inoculated from the societal disease that is antisemitism.

The comments came during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where Trump aired a long list of complaints about a wide range of issues, ranging from President Biden's new ban on offshore drilling, to his various legal cases, to the Panama Canal.

Negotiations between Hamas and Israel are ongoing in Qatar, with Hamas this week [naming 34 hostages](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/g-s1-41220/israel-hamas-hostage-negotiations)
 in Gaza — including two dual U.S. citizens — it would be willing to release in a ceasefire deal.

Steve Witcoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, joined Trump briefly and told reporters that "we're making a lot of progress" in trying to free hostages held by Hamas, and that he was "really hopeful that by the inaugural we'll have some good things to announce."

Trump would not elaborate on what he meant by his threat — first announced [on social media in early December](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113584730902816413)
 — that "all hell will break out" if a deal is not made.

"It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone," Trump said.

President-elect [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47)
 warned that if the hostages whom Hamas is still holding in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, “all hell will break out in the Middle East” – offering one more stark indication of how much the incoming president would prefer to avoid inheriting the Israel-Hamas war as he prepares to take office in less than two weeks.

“It will not be good for Hamas and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. [](#maincontent)

![U.S. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Tuesday, adding that “there should have never been” the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.

Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, struck an optimistic note about the state of negotiations to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would secure the release of the hostages, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress.”

“It’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,” Witkoff added. January 7, 2025.

U.S. January 7, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. CNN has previously reported that Biden administration officials are taking the lead in the talks, while their incoming Trump counterparts are being closely updated on developments.

But a senior Biden administration official struck a much more cautious tone following Trump and Witkoff’s comments, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.”

The official – who declined to comment further on the status of the talks – insisted that despite Witkoff appearing to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic, the talks are challenging. The first ceasefire – weeks after the October 7 attack – saw the release of dozens of hostages, but subsequent efforts to pause the fighting and secure the release of additional hostages have gone nowhere.

Witkoff told reporters he expected to travel back to Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday."

Content: "The assault was launched after Hamas fighters stormed Israeli territory in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israeli military strikes killed at least 24 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said, as the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory urged international donors to immediately provide fuel to run generators and maintain medical services.

One of those strikes killed four people in a house in Gaza City and six were killed in separate strikes across the enclave, medics said.

Later on Tuesday, an Israeli strike on a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip killed four children and eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia in the north, medics said.

Additionally, an Israeli strike on a car in Khan Younis killed two people, medics and civil emergency service officials said.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those strikes.

It said [240 Palestinians](/world/middle-east/israel-detains-medics-after-hospital-raid-health-officials-say-2024-12-28/)
 its forces had detained in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza last month had provided "substantial intelligence".

The military released footage of the interrogation of a purported Hamas militant who detailed how militants "operated from the hospital area" and transferred weapons to and from it.

Hamas and the Gaza health ministry deny any armed presence at the hospital.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hamas stood by its demand on Tuesday that Israel fully end its assault on Gaza under any deal to release hostages, and said U.S. 20 inauguration.

Officials from the Islamist group and Israel have been holding talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in the most intensive effort for months to reach a ceasefire [in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)

The outgoing U.S. administration has called for a final push for a deal before Joe Biden leaves office, and many in the region now view [Trump's inauguration](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/)
 as an unofficial deadline.

But with the clock ticking, both sides accuse the other of blocking a deal by adhering to conditions that torpedoed all previous peace efforts for more than a year.

Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw all its troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office did not comment.

In one notable step towards a deal, a Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday the group had [cleared a list](/world/middle-east/blinken-calls-push-get-gaza-truce-deal-over-finish-line-2025-01-06/)
 submitted by Israel of 34 hostages who could be freed in the initial phase of a truce, alongside Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

The list included female Israeli soldiers, plus elderly, female and minor-aged civilians. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

**\[1/3\]**A woman walks past posters of hostages kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, December 16, 2024. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are free.

"Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of the hostages," the director general of Israel's foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, told a briefing with reporters, saying Israel was fully committed to reaching a deal.

Hamas official Osama Hamdan, who held a news conference in Algiers, said Israel was to blame for undermining all efforts to reach a deal.

While he said he would not give details about the latest round of negotiations, he reiterated the Hamas conditions of "a complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded".

Commenting on Trump's threat that there would be "hell to pay" unless all hostages were freed before the inauguration, Hamdan said: "I think the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was rash to say there would be "hell to pay" unless they go free by his Jan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had so far received no confirmation about whether those on its list were still alive.

Content: "Except courage, courage is made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — André Fran (@andrefran) [October 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/andrefran/status/1716203264440467498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While it's entirely possible that Bourdain might have agreed with the words in the quote, we have so far been unable to find any credible record of him ever having made this exact statement.

Bourdain [died by suicide](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-asia-argento-last-texts-down-and-out-in-paradise-excerpt/)
 in June 2018 in France, reportedly [hanging himself](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-death-no-evidence-foul-play-violence-report/)
 in his hotel room. We'll also take a look back at the fact that Bourdain had visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for an episode of his CNN show, which resulted in several noteworthy comments and tweets he made in regard to Palestinians.

A Quote Misattributed
---------------------

The oldest version of the quote that we could find with Bourdain's name attached to it was from July 2021.

> “Today nearly everything is made in China-except for courage, it’s made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — Rama Al Malah (@MalahRama) [July 25, 2021](https://twitter.com/MalahRama/status/1419149132053221381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Meanwhile, we found similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, showing that his name had been misattributed with the quote.

> "Today nearly everything is made in China...except for courage- it's made in Palestine." [pic.twitter.com/zdnMsjEH4g](https://t.co/zdnMsjEH4g)
>

> Today almost everything is made in China!... [#psychicpowers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/psychicpowers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The episode included several key moments of narration from Bourdain that helped to shed light on what his thoughts _might_ be if he were still alive and asked about the "courage is made in Palestine" quote.

During the episode, upon entering a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, Bourdain referred to the territory as being "a prison":

!Anthony Bourdain was purported to have said the words today nearly everything is made in China except for courage which is made in Palestine. However, as we've noted below, Bourdain did have a record of making several remarks on the subject of Israel and Gaza, including comments and tweets specifically about Palestinians.

 Clifford May, the founder and president of FDD.

Khalidi told the [_New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)
, “I do not speak to the _Post_ (or the _Times_ for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late.” (The _Post_ noted it “did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.”

Dumisani Washington, founder and CEO of the Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DumisaniTemsgen/status/1862727604458938552)
 that Biden appearing with the book suggests that the president is not a friend of Jews and Israel.

“Elections matter,” [wrote](https://twitter.com/AdamMossoff/status/1862728873093263589)
 Adam Mossoff, a law professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Never forget the gaslighting by the Biden-Harris administration over the past year, and especially by Kamala Harris who periodically dropped her mask and did reveal her true beliefs.”

**‘The double pander continues’**

In a 2020 review of the work in question in _Jewish Review of Books_, the Israeli historian Benny Morris noted that Khalidi has downplayed his PLO connection in the past.

The book “turns out to be yet another somewhat turgid recitation of the traditional Palestinian narrative, its mantras being Western and Zionist guilt for everything that has befallen the Palestinians and a passionate, personal assertion of Palestinian innocence,” Morris [wrote](https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/7210/the-war-on-history/#)
. 

“Khalidi’s bottom line is that Zionism is a ‘colonialist’ enterprise, a doctrine enunciated in the Palestine National Charter of 1964,” he added. “It’s absolutely worthless.”

Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DanielPipes/status/1862849729689702594)
 that Biden said on Nov. 29, “Biden picks up _The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine_” by “former PLO spokesman and anti-Zionist fanatic Rashid Khalidi.”

“The double pander continues right up to Jan."

[President Biden](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden)
 on Friday picked up a copy of a book that described Israel as a colonial power in the face of Palestinian resistance despite his repeated support for the Jewish state. 

Biden was spotted by the press leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, the New York Post reported. 

"I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late," Khalidi told the Post of Biden holding his book. 

The newspaper noted it did not agree to any terms conditioning [Khalidi's response](https://www.foxnews.com/media)

In the book, Khalidi wrote about Israel's alleged discriminatory policies against Palestinians.

"Settler-colonial confrontations with indigenous peoples have only ended in one of three ways: with the elimination of full subjugation of the native population, as in North America; with the defeat and expulsion of the colonizer, as in Algeria, which is extremely rare; or with the abandonment of colonial supremacy, in the context of compromise and reconciliation, as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ireland," he wrote.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Khalidi and the White House.

The [book argues](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/hundred-years-war-on-palestine/)
 that "the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will."

Biden has repeatedly declared his support for Israel but has been criticized by Israeli supporters for putting conditions on U.S. Biden has also reportedly criticized his Israeli counterpart behind closed doors, the Post reported.

” by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi.

The book argues that “the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will.”

Khalidi, who is of Palestinian and Lebanese descent, refers to President-elect Donald Trump’s first administration as a “mouthpiece” for Israel and accuses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of leading “the most extreme government” in his country’s history.

The Arab Studies academic also slams what he describes as slanted press coverage in favor of Israel.

“I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is 4 years too late,” Khalidi told The Post, which did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.

It was not immediately clear if Biden purchased the book or if it was given to him while in the shop — after he and first son Hunter Biden, 54, dined with first daughter Ashley Biden and other family members at the nearby Brotherhood of Thieves restaurant ahead of the island’s annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.

Biden has repeatedly [referred to himself as a Zionist](https://nypost.com/2023/12/11/news/biden-warns-public-opinion-can-shift-on-israel-as-wh-accused-of-snubbing-hostage-families-from-hanukkah-event/)

” — with some even painting the moniker on the White House gates alongside red handprints.

 [!Author Rashid Khalidi is a Columbia University professor emeritus. The advantage that Israel has enjoyed in continuing its project rests on the fact that the basically colonial nature of the encounter in Palestine has not been visible to most Americans and many Europeans.”

 [!Biden poses for selfies during his stroll in Nantucket. <image:5227> 5](# "Open a slideshow of all 5 article images.")

Khalidi writes that the “popular resistance” among Palestinians “can be expected to continue to mount.”

The author praises the First Intifada by Palestinians against Israel, which left more than 2,000 dead after nearly six years of riots and rock-throwing between 1987 and 1993, ending in the Oslo Accords that granted limited self-rule to occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza.

“The First Intifada was an outstanding example of popular resistance against oppression and can be considered as being the first unmitigated victory for the Palestinians in the long colonial war that began in 1917,” the book says.

He has less positive words for the subsequent Second Intifada that’s better known for suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians, which resulted in a notorious security fence segregating Palestinian enclaves, writing that “the Second Intifada constituted a major setback for the Palestinian national movement.”

The Nantucket outing came just three days after Biden announced a US-brokered [cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel](https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/biden-announces-israel-hezbollah-cease-fire-plan-in-rose-garden-address/)

Biden has increasingly criticized Netanyahu in the past year over civilian casualties in Gaza and reportedly has used expletives to describe him behind closed doors.

Khalidi’s book knocks Trump for enacting a range of policies such as moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights from Syria. With this plan, the United States ceased to be ‘Israel’s lawyer,’ becoming instead the mouthpiece of the most extreme government in Israel’s history,” wrote Khalidi.

Israel ''did an illegal act by kidnapping us,'' says Greta Thunberg

Israel says it has deported Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, a day after the Gaza-bound aid boat she and 11 other people were on was intercepted by Israeli forces in the Mediterranean.

Thunberg departed Tel Aviv on Tuesday morning on a flight to France after she agreed to be deported, the Israeli foreign ministry said.

Upon arriving at an airport in Paris, Thunberg accused Israel of illegally kidnapping her and other activists on the boat while they were in international waters.

France said five of the six French citizens detained alongside her had refused to sign their deportation orders and would now be subject to judicial proceedings.

Thunberg arrives in Paris

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), the activist group operating the yacht The Madleen, has demanded the immediate release of everyone detained.

The vessel was intercepted early on Monday while the activists tried to deliver a "symbolic" amount of aid to Gaza in defiance of Israel's maritime blockade and highlight the humanitarian crisis there.

The Israeli foreign ministry dismissed it as a "selfie yacht", and announced in a post on X on Monday night that the passengers had been transferred to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport following the vessel's arrival at the port of Ashdod on Monday night.

"Those who refuse to sign deportation documents and leave Israel will be brought before a judicial authority, in accordance with Israeli law, to authorize their deportation," it said.

On Tuesday morning, the ministry said Thunberg had "just departed Israel on a flight to Sweden (via France)", and [posted a photo of her sitting on a plane](https://x.com/IsraelMFA/status/1932337642886021543)
.

Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport, Thunberg said Israel had committed "an illegal act by kidnapping us on international waters and against our will, bringing us to Israel, keeping us in the bottom of the boat, not letting us getting out and so on".

She added: "But that is not the real story here, the real story is that there is a genocide going on in Gaza, and a systematic starvation following the siege and blockade now, which is leading to food, medicine, water - that are desperately needed to get into Gaza - is prevented from doing so."

The Israeli foreign ministry has insisted the blockade was "consistent with international law", and that unauthorised attempts to breach it were "dangerous, unlawful, and undermine ongoing humanitarian efforts".

Asked why she was free while others were still detained, Thunberg said it was "a bit unclear". Their kidnapping is unlawful and a violation of international law," it added.

Israel's foreign ministry said the aid, which includes baby formula and medicine, would be transferred to Gaza "through real humanitarian channels".

The FFC said the Madleen was intercepted by the Israeli military inside international waters about 185km (115 miles) west of Gaza early on Monday.

According to the group, the vessel was surrounded by quadcopter drones, sprayed with a "white irritant substance", and had its communications jammed.

Video footage released by the group showed the passengers sitting down with their hands raised as Israeli forces boarded.

It also posted [a pre-recorded clip showing Thunberg saying](https://x.com/GazaFFlotilla/status/1931886800634818871)
: "If you see this video, we have been intercepted and kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupational forces or forces that support Israel."

"I urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible."

The foreign ministry later said all the passengers were "safe and unharmed", and posted a video showing troops handing them food and water.

! "I'm very worried about them," she said.

France's Foreign Minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, earlier wrote on X: "Our consul was able to see the six French nationals arrested by the Israeli authorities last night."

"One of them has agreed to leave voluntarily and should return today. It left the Italian city of Catania on 1 June and was intercepted by Israeli forces on 9 June, near the Ashdod port. <image:8620>

When the Madleen set sail from Italy on 1 June, the FFC said it was "carrying humanitarian aid and international human rights defenders in direct defiance of Israel's illegal and genocidal blockade". The Israeli foreign ministry called it a "gimmick", while Israel has rejected accusations of genocide.

On Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the maritime blockade was necessary to prevent the smuggling of weapons to Hamas.

Israel and Egypt imposed a land, sea and air blockade on Gaza when Hamas seized control of the territory in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections.

Israel stopped all deliveries of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March this year and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.

It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the group to release the hostages still held in Gaza, but the UN warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population were facing catastrophic levels of hunger because of the resulting shortages of food.

Three weeks ago, Israel launched an expanded offensive to take control of all areas of Gaza. It also partially eased the blockade, allowing in a "basic" amount of food.

Israel is now prioritising distribution through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which it backs along with the US. The UN and other aid groups are refusing to co-operate with the new system, saying it contravenes the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It is 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,927 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel deports Greta Thunberg after seizing of Gaza-bound ship
==============================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jun 10, 2025 1:52 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel deported activist Greta Thunberg on Tuesday, a day after the Gaza-bound ship she was on was seized by the Israeli military.

Speaking upon arrival in Paris en route to her home country of Sweden, Thunberg called for the release of the other activists who were detained aboard the Freedom Flotilla. The activists were held separately and some had trouble accessing lawyers, she added.

Asked why she agreed to deportation, she said, “Why would I want to stay in an Israeli prison more than necessary?”

Thunberg called on supporters to ask their governments “to demand not only humanitarian aid being let into Gaza but most importantly an end to the occupation and an end to the systemic oppression and violence that Palestinians are facing on an everyday basis.”

She said recognizing Palestine is “the very, very, very minimum” that governments can do to help.

Thunberg was one of 12 passengers on the Madleen. Israel rejects that charge, saying such ships intend to breach what it argues is a lawful naval blockade of Gaza.

Israel viewed the ship as a publicity stunt, calling it the “selfie yacht” with a “meager” amount of aid that amounted to less than a truckload.

Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. The trip was meant to protest Israeli restrictions on aid to Gaza’s population of over 2 million people after 20 months of war, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, the group behind the journey.

### Other activists face deportation

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said three activists, including Thunberg, had been deported along with a journalist. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters.

President Donald Trump called Thunberg “a young angry person” and recommended she take anger management classes.

“I think the world need a lot more young angry women,” Thunberg said Tuesday in response.

Thunberg said it appeared she was headed back to Sweden, hadn’t had access to a phone in a few days and wanted a shower. Israeli naval forces seized the boat without incident early Monday about 200 kilometers (125 miles) off Gaza.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, along with rights groups, said Israel’s actions in international waters were a violation of international law. It said it had encouraged some to do it so they could speak freely about their experiences.

Eight other passengers refused deportation and were in detention before their case is heard by Israeli authorities."

‘We did nothing wrong’: Greta Thunberg accuses Israel of kidnapping yacht crew
==============================================================================

This article is more than 2 months old

Swedish activist says ‘12 peaceful volunteers’ did not break laws during attempt to bring symbolic aid shipment to Gaza

Hours after being deported from Israel, [Greta Thunberg](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg)
 accused the country of kidnapping her and her fellow activists in international waters, adding that she had refused to sign a document stating that she had entered Israel illegally.

Speaking to reporters at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, the Swedish campaigner stressed that she and others on a [Gaza-bound ship](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/gaza-aid-boat-activists-greta-thunberg-israel-deportation)
 intercepted by Israel on Monday had simply been attempting to bring much-needed aid to the war-torn territory.

“We were 12 peaceful volunteers sailing on a civilian ship carrying humanitarian aid on international waters,” Thunberg said. We did nothing wrong.”

The UK-flagged Madleen vessel was [seized by Israeli authorities](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/gaza-aid-boat-madleen-israel-greta-thunberg-freedom-flotilla-coalition)
 on Monday about 125 miles (200km) off the coast of Gaza, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organised the voyage. It is a pirate attack in international waters,” he told reporters after arriving in Barcelona.

Amnesty International also weighed in, with the organisation’s secretary general noting that the interception of the Madleen in international waters “violates international law”. Israel’s military declined to comment.

In 2010, [nine activists were killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israel-kills-activists-flotilla-gaza)
 when Israeli commandos raided a small fleet of ships trying to ferry supplies, including building materials, to Gaza.

Thunberg said she hadn’t been able to say goodbye to the rest of the crew, and that it was “unclear” why she had been deported while other crew members remained detained.

Adalah, a legal rights group in Israel representing several of the crew members, said eight other passengers had refused deportation and were being held in detention as they waited for their cases to be heard by Israeli authorities

The crew had previously been disparaged by Israeli officials, with the foreign ministry labelling the vessel as the “selfie yacht” when it announced its seizure.

On Tuesday, officials shared photos of Thunberg, a climate activist who has [long shunned air travel](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/26/greta-thunberg-train-journey-through-europe-flygskam-no-fly)
, being boarded on to a flight to France.

Speaking after her arrival in Paris, Thunberg said the Gaza-bound ship had been a response to what she described as the “systematic starvation of over 2 million people and the full-blown, livestream genocide”.

While aid was critically needed in Gaza, the voyage had also been driven by a broader aim, she said. That’s the thing we need the most of.”

.

Thunberg, 22, said on Tuesday that the conditions the crew had faced were “absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now”, but said she was “very worried” about her fellow crew members and called for their immediate release.

“I was very clear in my testimony that we were kidnapped on international waters and brought against our own will into [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
,” she said. Some remain in Israel, where they will face deportation hearings.

The ship had been attempting to bring a symbolic shipment of aid to Gaza, which has been pushed [to the brink of famine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/food-security-experts-warn-gaza-critical-risk-famine-israeli-blockade)

 while trying to collect food from the handful of sites run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are secured by armed guards and under the protection of the Israeli military. “This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing.”

The stance was echoed by Sergio Toribio, a fellow crew member who was deported to Spain on Tuesday. In a statement, Agnès Callamard added: “The crew were unarmed activists and human rights defenders on a humanitarian mission, they must be released immediately and unconditionally.”

Since Israel imposed a naval blockade on Gaza in 2007, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition have made several attempts to carry aid to Gaza.

In May, one of their Gaza-bound ships [was damaged](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/02/gaza-humanitarian-aid-ship-bombed-drones-waters-off-malta)
 in international waters off Malta, with crew members issuing an SOS after what they described as an attack by Israeli drones. “Also to send solidarity and say that we see you, we see what is happening and we cannot accept just witnessing all this and doing nothing.”

Thunberg, who said it appeared she was now heading back to Sweden, also hit back at Donald Trump after she was asked about his characterisation of her as an “angry person” and suggestion that she should take anger management classes.

“I think the world needs many more young angry women, to be honest,” said Thunberg."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments. Specifically, a video from December 2024 shows her saying, "And f--- Israel!" Additionally, in June 2025, she was deported by Israel after being intercepted on a Gaza-bound aid boat. However, the evidence does not include an image of Thunberg holding a sign that says "Fuck Israel." Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

### After the Boomtown Rats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: After the Boomtown Rats")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg/250px-Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)

Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[5\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-5)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)

### Fathers' rights

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fathers' rights")\
\]

From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to [Father's Rights](/wiki/Father%27s_Rights "Father's Rights")
 campaigners; it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[130\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-130)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-Hand-131)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

After passengers on a recent Air Canada flight discovered that Israel had been removed from the in-flight interactive map and relabeled as the Palestinian Territories, the Canadian flag carrier says that the change is the result of a “display issue.”

“Air Canada has been made aware of a display issue with the interactive map on the IFE systems of its B737 aircraft,” it says in response to an image posted on X of the altered flight map.

“The issue has affected other carriers using the same system and we are working with the third-party provider on a remedy,” it adds.

Last September, passengers noticed a similar change had been made to the interactive maps aboard a JetBlue flight. The airline similarly said that the map had been provided by a third party company, and decided “after a careful review” to switch to a new map vendor.

![a plane flying over a map](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jetblue-Palestinian-map-9sep24.png)

JetBlue has been forced to make changes to its inflight maps and has dumped its current vendor of the popular passenger amenity after Jewish customers noticed that the State of Israel had been obliterated by a much larger place label describing the entire country as the ‘Palestinian Territories.’

Although JetBlue doesn’t even fly anywhere near Israel, JetBlue’s inflight map still has global coverage, and at least one passenger discovered the apparent snub to Israel.

The mistake then quickly went viral and JetBlue responded by launching a review into its third-party inflight map vendor. Always keeping an ear close to the ground, Matt's industry insights, analysis and news coverage is frequently relied upon by some of the biggest names in journalism.

In the meantime, JetBlue said it would find a new map vendor to ensure that inflight maps reflected the place naming convention recommended by the US government.

“We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue,” a spokesperson for the airline told an Israeli media outlet on Sunday.

The statement from the airline continued: “After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. When he went to fly home with JetBlue, however, he discovered that JetBlue had canceled his ticket.

In the wake of the controversy, JetBlue [accelerated its ongoing uniform review](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/05/11/jetblue-bans-flight-attendants-from-wearing-free-palestine-flag-pins-after-altercation-with-jewish-passenger/)
 and quickly decided that customer-facing staff can only wear pin badges for countries or territories that the airline currently serves.

Several months after JetBlue’s pin badge review, Delta Air Lines also decided to ban staffers from wearing Palestine badges after accusations of antisemitism when a flight attendant was spotted wearing one of the badges.

It was initially reported that the flight attendant was breaking Delta’s uniform policy but it quickly transpired that the crew member wasn’t doing anything wrong.

Delta has, however, [now banned flight attendants from wearing Palestine pin badges](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/07/12/delta-air-changes-uniform-policy-in-the-wake-of-palestine-flag-pin-furore-that-has-left-airline-on-back-foot/)
 – a decision that angered the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) which is currently trying to unionize Delta’s crew members.

Last month, however, United Airlines [decided not intervene](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/08/29/united-airlines-refuses-to-back-down-in-decision-to-allow-flight-attendants-to-wear-palestine-flag-pins-despite-accusations-of-antisemitism/)
 when some passengers complained about seeing flight attendants wearing Palestine pin badges.

In a statement, the airline said its long-standing policy of allowing employees to wear flag pins that either designate a language they speak or which represent “pride in a place to which they may have a special connection” would remain in force.

That means that Palestine pin badges continue to be an option for United flight attendants to wear.

! We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows.”

In May, JetBlue said it would ban flight attendants and other customer-facing staff from wearing ‘Free Palestine’ pin badges after a Jewish customer accused the airline of antisemitism following a run-in with a crew member who was wearing the controversial pin badge.

Paul Faust, 54, was flying with JetBlue on a flight from Fort Lauderdale when he noticed a flight attendant wearing a ‘Free Palestine’ pin badge and decided to approach one of her colleagues to explain that Jewish passengers could find the badge offensive.

Faust says he thought the matter was over after expressing his opinion, but upon landing, he discovered that the airline had called the cops on him.

When Faust deboarded, the cops hadn’t yet arrived so he didn’t wait around but thought the matter was over. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. <image:5310>

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

Biden laid out a three-phase [ceasefire proposal](/world/middle-east/whats-new-israel-ceasefire-proposal-biden-announced-2024-05-31/)

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/world/middle-east/obituary-tough-talking-haniyeh-was-seen-more-moderate-face-hamas-2024-07-31/)

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

Former President Donald J. election, we find ourselves teetering on the verge of fascism yet again — in large part because Vice President Kamala Harris has refused to distance herself from President Joe Biden’s disastrous, unconditional support for Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians.

Four years ago, I was working as an organizer in Arizona for the Biden campaign. Biden was not my choice in the primary, but I felt like we were making a necessary compromise: Biden, a moderate Democrat, would stave off a second term under Donald Trump. The success of the [Uncommitted movement](https://www.972mag.com/uncommitted-movement-democratic-party-palestine/)
 in Democratic primaries across the country made it clear that voters wanted Harris to break with Biden, and we believed we could pressure her campaign to come out in favor of an immediate ceasefire and stopping weapons transfers to Israel as long as they continued to violate US laws.

Instead, Harris has merely expressed slightly more empathy for Palestinian suffering, while showing no indication that she will compel Israel to end its war if she assumes the presidency. I spent 20 years of my life in Jewish schools and synagogues learning about the Holocaust; when I see these images from Gaza, the resemblance is impossible to ignore.

### **Trump’s promised crackdown — from the U.S. But there remains a large gap between winning people’s hearts and translating that popular sentiment into a change in policy — and that gap seems increasingly insurmountable. 

In the weeks leading up to this election, I have grappled with the sad truth that neither Harris nor Trump care about the Palestinian people, but one of them will be president in January. [Queer and trans people](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/heres-how-project-2025-could-decimate-lgbtq-rights)
 would face an assault on healthcare, legal protections, and marriage rights.

President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris debate for the first time during the presidential election campaign at The National Constitution Center on September 10, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After earning the Democratic Party nomination following President Joe Biden's decision to leave the race, Harris faced off with Trump in what may be the only debate of the 2024 race for the White House. “If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist within two years from now.”

The line of attack is not new for Trump, who told a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in a speech last week that "Israel is gone” if Harris wins the presidency. Israel will be gone."

Harris responded by saying Trump was trying to “divide and distract” from reality. 

“I have, my entire career and life, supported Israel and the Israeli people,” she said. 

"What we know is that this war must end," Harris said when pressed for her plan."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (<image:4075>). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/).

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (<image:4080>, <image:4081>, <image:4081>). The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. The article was updated on August 22, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248). NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (<image:4093>, <image:4092>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention the specific reason Trump gave Netanyahu for stopping the deal. The Newsweek article mentions allegations that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is not fully supported. While there is evidence of a phone call and discussion about the ceasefire, there is conflicting information about the specific reasons Trump gave Netanyahu.

[Caitlin Yilek](https://www.cbsnews.com/team/caitlin-yilek/)

Caitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C. Biden's answer to the nuclear site question, Trump said, should have been "hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later." 

Here are the positions Harris and Trump have taken on Israel and Iran. 

Israel-Gaza war
---------------

Harris has touted the Biden administration's efforts to broker a cease-fire deal between [Israel and Hamas](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-war-timeline-major-events-since-october-7-2023/)
 as the Gaza war hits the 1-year mark. During the 2020 campaign, Harris, who was running in a crowded Democratic presidential primary, [said](https://www.cfr.org/article/presidential-candidates-iran-nuclear-deal#chapter-title-0-9)
 she would seek to rejoin the Iran nuclear agreement, "so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance."

Trump has been highly critical of the Obama-era deal, formerly known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and removed the U.S. She previously worked for the Washington Examiner and The Hill, and was a member of the 2022 Paul Miller Washington Reporting Fellowship with the National Press Foundation.

 on Israel in early October to avenge the killing of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian officials, Vice President Kamala Harris already had to navigate a divide in the Democratic Party over the U.S. President Biden said last week he does not support a potential attack on Iran's nuclear sites by Israel. 

Former President Donald Trump blames the growing conflict on what he says is the weak leadership of Mr. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve." 

Harris has not laid out a plan for a two-state solution. 

Earlier this year she called on the Israeli government to do more to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Biden's decision in May to withhold a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs from Israel amid concerns that they'd be used in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians were sheltering after fleeing their homes.

The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. The article was updated on August 22, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248). NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (<image:4093>, <image:4092>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention the specific reason Trump gave Netanyahu for stopping the deal. The Newsweek article mentions allegations that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is not fully supported. While there is evidence of a phone call and discussion about the ceasefire, there is conflicting information about the specific reasons Trump gave Netanyahu.

He may not be in office, but Donald Trump has been speaking with the powers that be about Israel’s war on Gaza—but it’s not in an effort to end the genocide.

Instead, Trump has allegedly been talking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a cease-fire deal, fearing that doing so could help Vice President Kamala Harris win in November, according to PBS.

“The reporting is that former President Trump is on the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel, urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed that would help the Harris campaign,” said PBS’s Judy Woodruff Monday night.

Donald Trump, asked for the millionth time, still won’t commit to accepting election results as legitimate if he loses. Netanyahu’s office and Trump both [separately](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)

“I did encourage him to get this over with. But he also criticized cease-fire demands.

 indicated that the fringe political candidate spent more than he brought into the campaign in July, with more than half of his donations coming out of the pocket of his running mate [Nicole Shanahan](https://newrepublic.com/article/180135/rfk-jr-nicole-shanahan-running-mate-young-rich-worries-dems)
, a Silicon Valley lawyer and investor.

But shortly after the dire news broke, Shanahan revealed precisely why the conspiracy theorist has remained on the ballot so long, despite his [abysmal](https://elections2024.thehill.com/national/harris-trump-rfk-general/)
 polling.

“I’ve got to keep focusing on what matters the most outside of party lines. That could translate into a stronger third party in the next election cycle, thanks to public funds that could provide up to $13.5 million dollars to the fledgling political group.

“That means that we could position for a real third-party election in 2028, where we don’t have to go around and spend tens of millions of dollars on ballot access, which means that we can spend all of that time and money campaigning,” Shanahan said.

But there’s an entirely different outlook for the Kennedy campaign should they decide to pull out—and, according to Shanahan, it would all be for the benefit of one candidate.

“There’s two options that we’re looking at, and one is staying in, forming that new party, but we run the risk of a Kamala Harris and Walz presidency because we draw votes from Trump,” she said. Totally makes sense!

### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (<image:4075>). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/).

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (<image:4080>, <image:4081>, <image:4081>). The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign."

## Actions
```
web_search("Donald Trump Benjamin Netanyahu phone call August 14 2024 Gaza ceasefire")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (<image:4075>). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/).

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (<image:4080>, <image:4081>, <image:4081>). The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. The article was updated on August 22, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248). NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (<image:4093>, <image:4092>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention the specific reason Trump gave Netanyahu for stopping the deal. The Newsweek article mentions allegations that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is not fully supported. While there is evidence of a phone call and discussion about the ceasefire, there is conflicting information about the specific reasons Trump gave Netanyahu.

One article from 972mag.com discusses the US elections and the stance of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ([Source](https://www.972mag.com/harris-trump-palestine-us-elections/)). Al-Monitor reports that Trump said Kamala Harris "hates" Israel as she calls for an end to the Gaza war ([Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/09/trump-says-kamala-harris-hates-israel-she-calls-end-gaza-war/)). CBS News discusses the positions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the Israel-Gaza war ([Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-iran-israel-gaza-positions/)).

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire): 
Content: The New Republic reports that Donald Trump allegedly spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a ceasefire deal, fearing it would help Kamala Harris win in November. PBS reported that Trump was urging Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. Both Netanyahu's office and Trump denied the report. The article was published on August 20, 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that Trump and Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign is based on allegations. Both Trump and Netanyahu denied the report.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Jordan.

The claim states the image shows Gaza. The geolocation data does not confirm this. The claim also states the image was taken in December 2024. The evidence does not confirm this.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

From [Source](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/19/extermination-and-acts-genocide/israel-deliberately-depriving-palestinians-gaza): 
Content: "Based on the average daily death rates per-10,000-people at those levels of food insecurity, the healthcare providers estimated that more than 60,000 people in Gaza had died from malnutrition between October 2023 and June 2024, in addition to the tens of thousands directly killed in the hostilities.[\[106\]](#_ftn106)

“Even if the war stops, the level of destruction and damage to water and sanitation infrastructure will mean that humanitarian efforts will not be able to respond in a timely manner to save lives,” said Lama Abdul Samad, a WASH technical advisor on Oxfam’s Global Humanitarian Team.[\[107\]](#_ftn107)
 “That means that people may continue to suffer from a lack of water and food, and may become gravely sick due to a lack of sanitation and spread of diseases.”[\[108\]](#_ftn108)

Destruction of Health Infrastructure, Housing, Agriculture, and Forced Displacement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The impacts of Israeli forces’ destruction and damage to the water and sanitation infrastructure have been exacerbated by widespread destruction and damage during the hostilities to other elements critical for sustaining life and realizing human rights in Gaza, including healthcare facilities, housing, and agriculture.[\[109\]](#_ftn109)

In December, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors Without Borders) stated that Israeli authorities’ attacks on healthcare had led, by December 2023, to the “complete collapse … of the healthcare system in Gaza.”[\[110\]](#_ftn110)
 The destruction of Gaza’s healthcare infrastructure has left hundreds of thousands of people with water-borne illnesses, dehydration, and other water- and sanitation-related health problems without adequate access to health care.

Israeli forces have also apparently destroyed agricultural products and land, including razing orchards, fields, and greenhouses, according to Human Rights Watch’s analysis of satellite imagery. As of December 30, 2023, The Wall Street Journal had already reported that as many as 80 percent of the buildings in northern Gaza had been damaged or destroyed in the hostilities, as well as half of the buildings across all of Gaza, based on analysis of satellite data.[\[111\]](#_ftn111)

Until significant reconstruction can take place, the widespread destruction to critical infrastructure, housing, and agricultural land will have severe consequences on people’s abilities to access water and to maintain basic sanitation.

Israeli forces have also impacted people’s lack of access to water through the repeated displacement of the population, including 1 million people who were displaced in May 2024 as part of Israel’s incursion into Rafah, without providing or facilitating access to water in the areas where they were told to evacuate.[\[112\]](#_ftn112)
 Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention requires that parties to a conflict adhere to humanitarian standards when evacuating a population, including carrying out removals in “satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition.”[\[113\]](#_ftn113)
 On May 18, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini stated, “\[t\]he areas that people are fleeing to now do not have safe water supplies or sanitation facilities.”[\[114\]](#_ftn114)

The third set of provisional measures by the ICJ found that “Israel has not provided sufficient information concerning … the availability in the al-Mawasi area \[where civilians from Rafah were ordered to evacuate\] of water, sanitation, food, medicine and shelter.”[\[115\]](#_ftn115)

An employee of the CMWU told Human Rights Watch on May 30, 2024, “\[u\]nfortunately the situation is only getting more terrible. “A small amount \[of fuel\] to operate some of the \[undestroyed and undamaged\] wells in northern Gaza has entered,” he said.[\[239\]](#_ftn239)
 But he added that this was minimal compared to what was needed.[\[240\]](#_ftn240)
 “We’re talking about a lack of fuel which also impacts a lack of water,” he said.[\[241\]](#_ftn241)

On July 7, OCHA reported that “\[d\]ue to the lack of fuel, water production has drastically decreased, driving down public water distribution by 38 percent since early July.”[\[242\]](#_ftn242)

A doctor working for Gaza’s Ministry of Health stated that since the start of hostilities, these wells, which draw from groundwater largely unfit for human consumption, had become “primary sources of water” for people sheltering in and near hospitals.[\[243\]](#_ftn243)
 “All of this water is contaminated,” he said.[\[244\]](#_ftn244)

A journalist in southern Gaza told Human Rights Watch that he and his family, as well as the 80 displaced people sheltering with them, were getting water from “salty wells.”[\[245\]](#_ftn245)
 “The water is polluted, and people are getting sick, many people are suffering,” he said.[\[246\]](#_ftn246)

Compounding concerns about the salinity of well water, in December and January Israeli forces pumped seawater into tunnels beneath Gaza that the Israeli authorities said Hamas was using for military operations.[\[247\]](#_ftn247)
 Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as other environmental experts, have stated that flooding tunnels with seawater could have a catastrophic impact on Gaza’s water by causing seawater to seep into Gaza’s aquifer, and even render Gaza uninhabitable.[\[248\]](#_ftn248)
 In a report issued in June 2024, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) stated that “\[Gaza’s\] \[w\]ater supplies have also been contaminated by practices and military actions including the construction, flooding and destruction of the tunnel system.”[\[249\]](#_ftn249)

Inoperable Wastewater Facilities and Sewage Pumping Stations
------------------------------------------------------------

Gaza has six wastewater treatment plants and 65 sewage pumping stations.

By October 15, all of the wastewater treatment plants and most of the sewage pumping stations were forced to shut down due to the lack of fuel and electricity, which led to the overflow of sewage into the environment, including into the sea and soil, impacting the groundwater.[\[250\]](#_ftn250)

Wastewater treatment is both critical for replenishing the groundwater supply with fresh water, and for ensuring that sewage and untreated wastewater are not entering the environment—which can lead to the spread of diseases.

On January 11, OCHA stated that “repeated denials of fuel delivery to water and sanitation facilities, have deprived people of access to clean water, escalating the risk of sewage overflows and rapidly intensifying the spread of communicable diseases.”[\[251\]](#_ftn251)

On February 9, OCHA reported that flooding around Zeitoun sewage pumping station, which was damaged by Israeli attacks, posed “a potential crisis” of sewage overflow in the area around the station.[\[252\]](#_ftn252)
 “This is further compounded by fuel shortage, which impedes the operation of sewage stations,” OCHA added in the statement.[\[253\]](#_ftn253)

On April 29, OCHA reported that the CMWU had informed them that the wastewater treatment plant in Rafah was overflowing with sewage due to the lack of electricity and fuel to operate the facility.[\[254\]](#_ftn254)

On July 4, the Emergency Committee of Khan Younis Municipality in southern Gaza stated that the restrictions on fuel imports had caused the “complete crippling of services to the municipality,” including sewage pumping stations and water wells.[\[255\]](#_ftn255)

  
 

III. These elements include large craters consistent with the use of air-dropped munitions, the razing of solar panels fields by bulldozers, and the complete destruction of buildings.

The exact coordinates of all of Gaza’s WASH infrastructure, including the CMWU warehouse and headquarters, had all been shared with Israeli authorities by an international humanitarian agency prior to the start of the hostilities, according to employees of the CMWU.[\[262\]](#_ftn262)
 One employee explained that the aim of sharing the coordinates was to “protect the facilities from targeting \[by Israeli forces\] during conflicts.”[\[263\]](#_ftn263)
 Several facilities, including the CMWU’s warehouse, had been confirmed by Israeli forces to UNICEF and the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), based in Ramallah, as being deconflicted after the start of hostilities in order to ensure that Israeli forces were aware of facilities that provide essential services to civilians in Gaza and could avoid damaging them.[\[264\]](#_ftn264)
 Despite these measures, Israeli forces still attacked the CMWU’s central warehouse on January 21 and 22, 2024, damaging and destroying vast amounts of critical WASH materials.

An Oxfam analysis found that a significant portion of the infrastructure that Oxfam and its WASH partners installed or rehabilitated from 2017 to 2023 has been damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks since October 7, 2023, rendering much of it inoperable.[\[265\]](#_ftn265)
 The locations of this infrastructure were deconflicted, or shared with relevant authorities to “avoid potential hazards” for humanitarian aid provision, through the appropriate channels in order to ensure that the Israeli government was aware of and could avoid damaging facilities that provide essential services to civilians in Gaza.[\[266\]](#_ftn266)

A separate Oxfam report found that as of February 24, Israeli forces had damaged or destroyed 12 water and sanitation projects that had been built by Oxfam and Oxfam’s partners, despite all having been deconflicted with the Israeli military in December.[\[267\]](#_ftn267)
 In the absence of valid military targets, these attacks would be unlawfully indiscriminate if not deliberate.

Israeli forces’ use of explosive weapons with wide area affects in populated areas of Gaza raises significant concerns of indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war. New traces of razing by bulldozers on the perimeter of the plant also appeared by that date, including on parts of the solar panel field that had previously been razed and which had then been cleared of debris.

Israeli forces, having ordered the area evacuated, had advanced west of the area to the outskirts of al-Bureij refugee camp itself by December 27, according to maps based on information published by the Israeli authorities.[\[273\]](#_ftn273)

The wastewater treatment plant, which opened in 2021 and was intended to serve one million people, had taken 20 years to plan and build due to “lengthy consultations with the Israeli authorities” as well as challenges to import restrictions, the German government development bank KfW reported.[\[274\]](#_ftn274)
 Germany invested 85 million euros into the facility.

### North Gaza Wastewater Treatment Plant

The North Gaza wastewater treatment plant also showed similar patterns of damage and destruction. On December 8, 2023, Human Rights Watch contacted the Israeli army for comment on the alleged razing of agricultural land in northern Gaza, but did not receive a response.

UNOSAT found that as of July 28, 2024, about 65 percent of all cropland in Gaza had been damaged.[\[546\]](#_ftn546)
 The destruction of agricultural lands not only exacerbates current food shortages, but will also have devastating long-term consequences for food production in Gaza.

Forced Displacement
-------------------

According to the UN, 1.9 million people were displaced in Gaza as of November 2024 out of a remaining population of 2.1 million people.[\[547\]](#_ftn547)
 During the nearly 15 months of hostilities, the Israeli military has repeatedly ordered Palestinians to move to areas where civilian infrastructure was either non-existent, such as the al-Mawasi “safe zone” in previously uninhabited areas near the seashore, or where previous bombardment and fighting had extensively damaged and destroyed civilian buildings and infrastructure, leaving the displaced with utterly inadequate access to water, food, medical care, and shelter.

In May 2024, Israeli authorities ordered Palestinians in Rafah to evacuate to al-Mawasi, a Palestinian Bedouin town on the southern coast of the Gaza Strip. Would you like to read this page in another language?

Summary
=======

Since October 2023, Israeli authorities have deliberately obstructed Palestinians’ access to the adequate amount of water required for survival in the Gaza Strip.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a person needs between 50 and 100 liters of water per day in order to ensure that their “most basic needs are met.”[\[1\]](#_ftn1)
 In protracted emergency situations, the minimum amount of water required is 15 liters of water per person per day for drinking and washing.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)
 Yet, between October 2023 and September 2024, Israeli authorities’ actions have deprived the majority of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza of access to even that bare minimum amount of water, which has contributed to death and widespread disease.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)
 For many in Gaza, much or all of the water they have had access to is not suitable for drinking.

“If we can't find drinkable water, we drink the sea water,” one father displaced to a school in Rafah told Human Rights Watch in December 2023.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)
 “It happened to me many times when I had to drink the sea water. These show extensive damage and destruction to water and sanitation infrastructure, including the apparently deliberate, systematic razing of the solar panels powering four of Gaza’s six wastewater treatment plants by Israeli ground forces, as well as Israeli soldiers filming themselves demolishing a key water reservoir.[\[8\]](#_ftn8)

Israeli authorities did not reply to letters sent on June 10 and November 29, 2024, requesting information regarding specific attacks on water and sanitation infrastructure that Human Rights Watch documented.

Israeli authorities made clear their intention to deprive the population of Gaza of necessities after October 7, 2023. On October 9, 2023, they cut off water being piped into Gaza from Israel, which accounted for about 12 percent of Gaza’s total water supply and more than half of its drinking water.[\[18\]](#_ftn18)

While Israeli authorities resumed piping some water into Gaza from Israel at the end of October 2023, as of September 2024, they have continued to restrict the amount of water entering through the pipelines.[\[19\]](#_ftn19)
 The water from the pipelines has been insufficient to offset the decrease in water production caused by Israeli authorities’ cutting off of electricity supply and blocking and restricting of fuel imports, and by the damage or destruction of water infrastructure.

Israeli authorities also cut off the electricity that Israel supplies to Gaza, plunging the strip into darkness and impairing the operability of nearly all of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure necessary for the delivery of goods and services essential to life, including hospitals.[\[20\]](#_ftn20)

On October 12, 2023, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that “most residents in the Gaza Strip no longer have access to drinking water from service providers or domestic water through pipelines.”[\[21\]](#_ftn21)

Israeli authorities also initially blocked completely, and later severely restricted, the entry of fuel into Gaza. In January 2024, the World Bank and Ipsos, a market research firm, estimated that nearly 60 percent of Gaza’s water and sanitation infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed by the hostilities.[\[64\]](#_ftn64)
 By August 2024, they reported that the percentage of WASH infrastructure that had been destroyed or damaged had risen to 84.6 percent.[\[65\]](#_ftn65)
 While it was not possible to determine the party responsible for the damage or destruction from these reports, the devastating impact on WASH infrastructure during the hostilities increases the likelihood of civilian harm in the deliberate cases of Israeli forces’ destruction of WASH infrastructure that Human Rights Watch documented.

OCHA reported on July 24 that the “water situation \[in Gaza\] was \[continuing\] to deteriorate.”[\[66\]](#_ftn66)
 Between July 24 and July 27, 2024, an Israeli soldier posted a video of himself and other soldiers laying explosives to destroy an important water reservoir serving Rafah in the south."

RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinians in Gaza are confronting [an apocalyptic landscape of devastation](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-damage-reconstruction-d120f8a0dc8b728c0d8332046a524a92)
 after a ceasefire paused more than 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas.

Across the tiny coastal enclave, where built-up refugee camps are interspersed between cities, drone footage captured by The Associated Press shows mounds of rubble stretching [as far as the eye can see](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-destruction-satellite-photos-90093bca75d28af6193c21b9d1b5eaed)
 — remnants of the longest and deadliest war between Israel and Hamas in their blood-ridden history.

      ![An aerial photograph taken by a drone shows displaced Palestinians returning to Rafah, a day after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect, Gaza Strip, Monday, Jan. including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, view the vast destruction as part of a broader pattern of extermination and genocide directed at Palestinians in Gaza, a charge Israel denies. Secondary blasts from Hamas explosives inside these buildings could worsen the damage.

The way Israel has repeatedly returned to areas it said were under its control, only to have militants overrun it again, has exacerbated the destruction, Savill said.

In the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, residents returned to find their homes reduced to rubble. He denied Israel had cleared civilian areas indiscriminately.

The destruction, like the civilian death toll in Gaza, has raised accusations that Israel committed war crimes, which it denies.  [![AP Logo](https://assets.apnews.com/19/66/bc546486408c8595f01753a9fbeb/ap-logo-176-by-208.svg)](/)

Account claiming Mossad links denies Iran's Quds Force chief is Israeli spy

Mossad Farsi social media page rejects claims that Esmail Qaani was compromised, as IRGC commander reappears in Tehran after reports of his death; speculation had swirled since Nasrallah’s assassination and Israeli strikes on Iran

IRGC Quds Force chief Esmail Qaani

(Photo: AFP)

Qaani appeared in public this week in Tehran, where Iranian officials held what they described as “victory celebrations” following the ceasefire. The account, whose affiliation with Israel’s intelligence services has not been confirmed or denied, has previously offered online telemedicine services to Iranians while criticizing the regime's prioritization of elite security interests over civilian needs.

The latest post followed a message on X by a user claiming to be Qaani himself, in which he rejected allegations of espionage. In [state media images](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe)
, the 62-year-old commander was seen in civilian clothing and a black baseball cap, speaking casually with civilians—his first appearance since reports during the war claimed he had been killed.

During the height of the conflict, The New York Times reported that Qaani may have been assassinated in an Israeli strike targeting senior IRGC figures. Following that operation, rumors circulated that [Qaani had been placed under interrogation by Iranian authorities](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syffl6hyyg)
 due to suspected Israeli infiltration of Hezbollah."

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources indicate that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, after a ceasefire, and that a social media account linked to Mossad denied rumors of ties to him. This suggests he did not flee Iran in April 2025 and is not confirmed safe in Israel.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Israel did bomb military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. The image search results confirm this, with Al Jazeera reporting on the event. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim does not provide strong evidence to support the claim. The image search results do not include the image from the claim.

The claim states that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots. This specific detail cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially supported. The bombing did occur, but the specific details about the destruction of the last remaining army depots cannot be confirmed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>). Al Jazeera reports that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel did bomb military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. The image search results confirm this, with Al Jazeera reporting on the event. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim does not provide strong evidence to support the claim. The image search results do not include the image from the claim.

The claim states that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots. This specific detail cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially supported. The bombing did occur, but the specific details about the destruction of the last remaining army depots cannot be confirmed.

The claim states that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots. This specific detail cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially supported. The bombing did occur, but the specific details about the destruction of the last remaining army depots cannot be confirmed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the Israeli invasion of Syria, which began in December 2024, including airstrikes and ground incursions, primarily in southern Syria and Damascus. The article mentions the involvement of various Israeli military units and the reactions of involved parties. The Syrian Archive published an article on July 18, 2025, about Israeli attacks on Syria from February to May 2025, including data on the distribution of incidents by month, governorate, and type of impact site.

## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that Israel conducted airstrikes in Syria, including the Damascus area, during February 2025. The Wikipedia article and the Syrian Archive provide additional context, such as the Israeli invasion starting in December 2024 and the distribution of attacks.

However, the evidence still does not confirm the claim that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots.

The claim is partially supported.

Israel destroys weapons depot, causes massive explosion in Syria's Dayr al-Zawr: Reports
========================================================================================

Tuesday, 04 February 2025 6:38 AM  **\[ Last Update: Wednesday, 05 February 2025 6:31 AM \]**

[](https://preview.presstv.ir/ptv///iran/20250204/syria.mp4)
[](https://www.presstv.ir/default/Embeded/742153)

This video grab shows the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike against a weapons depot on the outskirts of the city of Dayr al-Zawr, eastern Syria, early on February 4, 2025.

**Israeli military aircraft reportedly carry out an airstrike against military installations inside Syria, in the latest such acts of aggression since militant factions, led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, toppled the government of Bashar al-Assad in early December last year.**

An Israeli aerial attack targeted and destroyed a weapons depot near the city of Dayr al-Zawr, located 450 kilometers (279 miles) northeast of the capital Damascus, before daybreak on Tuesday, local media outlets reported.

The attack leveled the depot and caused massive explosions heard from long distances, the reports added.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli regime or the military on the airstrike.

Following the collapse of the Syrian government, the Israeli military has been launching airstrikes against military installations, facilities, and arsenals belonging to Syria's now-defunct army.

The occupying regime's attacks have drawn widespread condemnation for violating Syria’s sovereignty and devastating assets belonging to the Arab nation.

In the wake of the fall of Assad, Israel, which has occupied the Syrian Golan Heights since 1967, also invaded a UN-patrolled buffer zone in southwestern Syria, taking over the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, known as Jabal al-Shaykh in Arabic, as well as a number of Syrian towns and villages.

Israel has also come under censure over termination of the 1974 ceasefire agreement with Syria, and exploiting the chaos in the Arab nation in the wake of Assad’s downfall to make a land grab.

The buffer zone in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights was created by the United Nations after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.  A UN force of about 1,100 troops had patrolled the area since then.

Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, said last December that the presence of Israeli soldiers, however long it lasts, violates the deal that established the buffer zone.

That agreement “needs to be respected, and occupation is occupation, whether it lasts a week, a month or a year, it remains occupation,” Dujarric pointed out.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:41>)
image_search("Israel bombing Damascus February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'Taiwan': 0.06, 'Ghana': 0.05, 'Ukraine': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.05, 'Nigeria': 0.04, 'Sri Lanka': 0.04, 'India': 0.03, 'Israel': 0.03}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (<image:7270>). Al Jazeera reports that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (<image:7271>). The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (<image:7272>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel did bomb military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. The image search results confirm this, with Al Jazeera reporting on the event. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim does not provide strong evidence to support the claim. The image search results do not include the image from the claim.

The claim states that the bombing destroyed the last remaining army depots. This specific detail cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially supported. The bombing did occur, but the specific details about the destruction of the last remaining army depots cannot be confirmed.

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")

While largely symbolic, the action by Spain’s second-largest city adds to mounting criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Spain will continue to raise its voice, stronger than ever, to end the massacre the world is witnessing today,” Sánchez posted on X earlier this week.

Barcelona Cuts Ties With Israeli Government Over Gaza War

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to sever official ties with the Israeli government and suspend its 1998 friendship agreement with Tel Aviv. The move comes during Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, which has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the Spanish government.

The motion was backed by the governing Socialist party and supported by far-left and pro-independence factions. It calls for cutting all institutional relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored. In recent months, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has repeatedly accused Israel of violating international law and using disproportionate force, warning that its military campaign risks destabilizing the region.

“A year after recognizing Palestine as a state, the pain in Gaza is unbearable."

In late May, Collboni’s Socialist-led council voted to cut “all institutional ties with the current Israeli government until human rights in Gaza are respected,” reversing his own September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties, which had been severed by his predecessor Ada Colau.

The council’s move included economic steps to block cooperation with companies linked to Israel, as identified by the UN for alleged illegal operations in territories harming Palestinian rights, economy, society and culture. It also directed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged Barcelona’s port to deny docking to ships carrying arms to Israel.

Barcelona mayor cancels trip to Israel amid entry ban
=====================================================

22 August 2025 16:42

**Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni on August 22, two months after his city council cut all institutional ties with the Israeli government and ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.**

Collboni, who had planned to visit Yad Vashem and the Palestinian Authority, cancelled his trip following the refusal, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3q42skex)
** Israeli media.

His entry request through the ETA system, which pre-screens travellers from visa-exempt countries, was rejected due to his anti-Israel statements. It also instructed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged the city’s port to deny docking to ships transporting arms to Israel.

The move mirrors Spain’s position among 21 nations condemning Israel’s E1 plan in Ma’ale Adumim, which disrupts Palestinian territorial continuity between Ramallah and Bethlehem and has been described as a potential “death knell” for a Palestinian state.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image could be from February 2023, when Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag. However, the claim states the image is from September 2024. The evidence also mentions that in September 2024, Barcelona reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible, but the evidence does not confirm the image's date.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information to confirm the image's date and the context of the event.

The image shows FC Barcelona's president with Israeli representatives holding an Israeli flag. The event could have taken place in February 2023, but the claim states it happened in September 2024.

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing alleged violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, called for an end to all official relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with the liberal coastal city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organizer Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

“The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable,” Barcelona’s Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

It was not the first time Barcelona had moved to suspend ties with Israel.

In 2023, then-mayor Ada Colau took similar steps, which were later reversed when Collboni won local elections.

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain’s second-largest city — a top tourist destination and home to one of the world’s best-known football clubs — adds to a growing list of critics of Israel amid the devastating war in Gaza.

Barcelona’s move came a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel’s military operations in Gaza amid the war sparked by the Hamas terror group’s devastating attack on October 7, 2023.

UEFA said its disciplinary judges also fined Barcelona $11,000 and ordered a new probationary sanction for a repeat offence in the next year. That will activate another ticket sales ban for one away game in a European competition.

The defeat at Monaco was the only blip in Barcelona’s season with victories recorded in all seven of their Spanish top-flight matches."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)) and i24NEWS ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)) reported that FC Barcelona's president Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag by Israeli diplomats in February 2023 (<image:1>, <image:10638>). The event occurred after Barcelona ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.

FC Barcelona's website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel)) reported that Joan Laporta met with the president of Israel Isaac Herzog on July 18, 2021 (<image:10640>, <image:10639>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Media Line published an article on May 31, 2025, discussing Barcelona's decision to cut ties with the Israeli government due to the ongoing war in Gaza, and mentions a pro-Palestine march in Barcelona in February 2024 (<image:10647>, <image:10648>). Ynet News discusses the Barcelona mayor's visit to Israel being denied due to his anti-Israel stance and the city council's decision to sever ties with the Israeli government, reversing a September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties (<image:10650>).

Caliber.Az reported on August 22, 2025, that Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni due to his anti-Israel statements, and that in September 2024, Collboni's council reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image could be from February 2023, when Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag. However, the claim states the image is from September 2024. The evidence also mentions that in September 2024, Barcelona reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible, but the evidence does not confirm the image's date.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information to confirm the image's date and the context of the event.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Turkey. The image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically mentioning the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence points to the image being related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim is therefore false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

The evidence confirms an Israeli attack on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

Since the evidence does not directly link the individuals in the image to the attack, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the identities of the children and their involvement in the incident. `not enough information`

### Support Countercurrents

Countercurrents is answerable only to our readers. At least 16 people were killed in this latest massacre at a UN school that was previously announced as a safe area by the Israeli military.

https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1809622090565251139

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background.

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza, which killed at least 16 people (<image:10757>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:10758>). The UNRWA website does not contain any relevant information.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

 fired two missiles at Al-Sardi, a [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 school in the [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
. Israel had previously been criticized during the offensive for the offensive itself and airstrikes conducted by Israel, such as the [Tel Al-Sultan attack](/w/index.php?title=Tel_Al-Sultan_attack&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tel Al-Sultan attack (page does not exist)")
, in which 45–50 Palestinian civilians were killed in an area designated a "safe zone" for civilians in the [Gaza Strip](/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:5-11)
 UNRWA said 6,000 Palestinian refugees were sheltering in the school at the time of the attack.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Reuters2-12)
 Since the start of the war, more than 180 UN agency buildings have been hit and more than 450 displaced people have been killed in those facilities.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

Attack
------

On 6 June 2024, at approximately 2 am,[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)

 Israeli forces targeted the classrooms on the highest floor of the Al-Sardi school in the Nuseirat refugee camp with two missiles in an airstrike.[\[2\]](#cite_note-bbc4-2)
 The strike was carried after the army declared new ground assaults and airstrikes on several refugee camps in central Gaza.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera1-16)
 The munition used in the attack was of the same variety employed in the Tel al-Sultan attack, namely a [GBU-39](/wiki/GBU-39_Small_Diameter_Bomb "GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb")
.[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)

Casualties
