### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/bombing): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains images related to explosions and bombings. ![image 10087](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537046-888768.jpg), ![image 10088](media/2025-08-30_06-57-1756537047-173492.jpg), <image:10089>, <image:10090>, <image:10091>, <image:10092>, <image:10093>, <image:10094>, <image:10095>, <image:10096>, <image:10097>, <image:10098>, <image:10099>, <image:10100>, <image:10101>, <image:10102>, <image:10103>, <image:10104>, <image:10105>, <image:10106>, <image:10107>, <image:10108>, <image:10109>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was taken in Palestine or Israel. The image was taken by Anadolu Agency. The search results do not support the claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The search results show images of bombings in Gaza and Ukraine.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The date and location are not consistent with the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely from Palestine or Israel, and the search results do not support the claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The image was taken by Anadolu Agency.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not of the U.S. bombarding Yemen. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image, likely taken in Palestine or Israel, was captured by the Anadolu Agency and does not depict the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The search results reveal images of bombings in Gaza and Ukraine, contradicting the claim's context of the U.S. bombing Yemen on December 22, 2024.
