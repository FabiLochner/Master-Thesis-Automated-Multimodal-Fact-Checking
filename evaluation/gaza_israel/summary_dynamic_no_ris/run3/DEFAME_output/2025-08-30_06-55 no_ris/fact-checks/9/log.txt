The claim '<image:9> This image shows an Israeli missile attack on Iran in the early hours of October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there were indeed Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, as reported by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024), CNN, and Al Jazeera, the image in the claim cannot be confirmed as depicting an Israeli missile attack. The geolocate action suggests the image was likely taken in China or Malaysia.

So, the overall veracity is: false
