## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ynetnews.com published an article on June 24, 2025, stating that a social media account claiming to represent the Mossad denied that Esmail Qaani is an Israeli asset. The article mentions that Qaani appeared in Tehran after a ceasefire, and includes an image of Qaani. The article also references a previous report in The New York Times about Qaani's possible assassination. ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sytrh21hxe](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sytrh21hxe))

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 30, 2025, about an X account linked to Mossad denying rumors of ties to Esmail Qaani. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504)) Anadolu Agency reported on June 25, 2025, that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran, contradicting earlier reports of his death. ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018)) ![image 10484](media/2025-08-30_07-16-1756538197-079123.jpg) ![image 1](media/0.jpg) <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force since January 2020, was reportedly seen at a rally in Tehran on June 25, 2025, according to The Jerusalem Post (<image:k> - [https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-858902)). However, The New York Times reported that Qaani was killed during an Israeli strike in Iran, citing an Iranian source.

Concerns about Qaani's whereabouts emerged in early October 2024, as noted in his Wikipedia article (<image:k> - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)).


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Multiple sources indicate that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, after a ceasefire, and that a social media account linked to Mossad denied rumors of ties to him. This suggests he did not flee Iran in April 2025 and is not confirmed safe in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel. The sources also include denials from accounts linked to Mossad.
