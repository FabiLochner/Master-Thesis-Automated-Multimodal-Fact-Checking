### Evidence from `image_search`
Haaretz published an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-01-19/ty-article/.premium/detailed-building-plan-for-netanyahus-seaside-villa-were-available-online/00000185-c4f6-d279-a9b7-ccf770210000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2023-01-19/ty-article/.premium/detailed-building-plan-for-netanyahus-seaside-villa-were-available-online/00000185-c4f6-d279-a9b7-ccf770210000)). Siasat.com contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://www.siasat.com/hezbollah-drone-flies-over-films-netanyahus-residence-report-3080894/](https://www.siasat.com/hezbollah-drone-flies-over-films-netanyahus-residence-report-3080894/)). The Aviationist published an article about an alleged drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house ([https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/19/netanyahus-house-attacked-by-drone/](https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/19/netanyahus-house-attacked-by-drone/)).

The search results include images of Benjamin Netanyahu's house (![image 10644](media/2025-08-30_07-26-1756538804-136788.jpg), ![image 10645](media/2025-08-30_07-26-1756538804-316736.jpg), ![image 10646](media/2025-08-30_07-26-1756538805-388445.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. The "geolocate" action indicates that Israel is a possible location. The web search confirms that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. The image search also provides images of Netanyahu's house. However, the exact date of the image and whether it was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 cannot be confirmed with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house is supported by the evidence. However, the claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not confirmed by the evidence. The drone attack occurred in October 2024. Therefore, the claim is partially false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by multiple sources ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), [https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk)). However, the claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence, as the drone attack occurred in October 2024.
