The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (![image 2136](media/2025-07-20_11-01-1753009311-406752.jpg)). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (![image 2128](media/2025-07-20_11-01-1753009292-769516.jpg)) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (![image 2130](media/2025-07-20_11-01-1753009295-515858.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.
