### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost, according to shopisrael.com ([https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X)). Marca.com ([https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2023/10/11/6526c4cc22601d2d748b45da.html](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2023/10/11/6526c4cc22601d2d748b45da.html)) reports that Johnson expressed heartbreak and outrage at the acts of Hamas.

Variety ([https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)) mentions that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has expressed support for Israel amid the conflict. <image:0>, ![image 2699](media/2025-07-20_11-27-1753010831-407396.jpg), ![image 2700](media/2025-07-20_11-27-1753010866-160819.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

## Elaboration
The image search results show that the image in the claim is a fabricated image. Myth Detector fact-checked a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson, which included an image of him with the Israeli flag.

Therefore, the claim is false.

The image in the claim is a fabricated image. Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel, but the image of him with the Israeli flag and a sign is not authentic.

`false`
