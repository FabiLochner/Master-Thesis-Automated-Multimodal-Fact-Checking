Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost, according to shopisrael.com ([https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X)).

Variety ([https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/)) mentions that Johnson, along with other Hollywood stars, has expressed support for Israel amid the conflict. <image:0>, <image:2699>, <image:2700>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the image search results show that there are fake images of Dwayne Johnson. The evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim's veracity. More information is needed to confirm the image's authenticity.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

The China Daily published an image of a dog attacking an elderly woman (<image:7844>). Al Jazeera published a video on June 26, 2024, showing an elderly Palestinian woman (<image:7845>). Al-Haq provides an image of a dog attacking a woman (<image:7846>).

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).

From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp):

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

**GAZA CITY, Palestine**

A 70-year-old Palestinian woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, still grapples with the trauma of being viciously attacked by an Israeli army dog in her small home In Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, located in the northern Gaza Strip. 

While lying in bed after her night prayers, she was suddenly attacked by an Israeli army dog, which stormed into her room and bit deeply into her arm.

This incident occurred during a 20-day attack by the Israeli military on the camp from May 12 to May 31.

Recounting her ordeal to Anadolu, the elderly woman said: "As I was drifting off to sleep, the dog wearing a camera on its back entered the room and attacked me. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

The sources are: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm), [https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman), and [https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.

Your email address will not be published. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

From [Source](https://explora.mu/photos/940-brown-dog-with-a-head-lamp): 
Content: The search result shows a brown dog with a headlamp. <image:10782>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images and a video related to dogs attacking elderly Palestinian women. The Al Jazeera video was published on June 26, 2024. The image search also found an image of a dog with a headlamp.

The claim states that the image is authentic and depicts an Israeli army dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in June 2024. While the evidence confirms that such attacks have occurred, there is no evidence to confirm the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search did not return the same image.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information.
