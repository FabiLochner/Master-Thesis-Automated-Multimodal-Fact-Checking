## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike is false, according to an AOL fact-check published on December 12, 2024, which states there is no evidence to support the claim and no media outlets have reported his death (![image 9359](media/2025-08-30_00-44-1756514675-797503.jpg)). Inshorts also reported on December 9, 2024, that Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed by Hezbollah in a November drone attack, with the false claim circulating online after a ceasefire announcement (![image 9402](media/2025-08-30_00-44-1756514691-440752.jpg), ![image 9404](media/2025-08-30_00-44-1756514692-366115.jpg), ![image 9406](media/2025-08-30_00-44-1756514692-598968.jpg)).

The search results also mention Tomer Bar, Commander of the Israeli Air Force, and the killing of journalists in Gaza.


### Evidence from `web_search`
Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024, which was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities.

CUFI discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar. (![image 9442](media/2025-08-30_00-45-1756514729-478189.jpg)) [Source](https://cufi.org/issue/this-is-how-the-hezbollah-uav-evaded-detection-with-fatal-results/)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Fact-checks from AOL and Inshorts confirm that Major General Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed in a drone attack. While Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted his residence, this does not confirm the claim's veracity.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including AOL and Inshorts, have fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike is false. Fact-checks from sources like AOL and Inshorts state that there is no evidence to support the claim, and Tomer Bar is alive.
