The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-of-blood-protesters-stage-mock-funeral-for-slain-hostages-demand-deal/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-of-blood-protesters-stage-mock-funeral-for-slain-hostages-demand-deal/)) and Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages](https://www.euronews.com/2024/09/05/protesters-march-in-tel-aviv-with-makeshift-coffins-to-demand-release-of-gaza-hostages)) report on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where demonstrators carried mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages. ![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-466872.jpg), ![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-848473.jpg), ![image 4537](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911061-234441.jpg), ![image 4538](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911062-238270.jpg), ![image 4539](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911063-664037.jpg), and ![image 49](media/80.jpg).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rjzi00tqqkl): 
Content: Ynetnews.com published an image of a protest. ![image 9851](media/2025-08-30_01-14-1756516465-370978.jpg)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.98, 'Palestine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0, 'Bermuda': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Israel, as confirmed by the geolocation data. The web search results indicate that the mock coffins were used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, to demand the release of hostages. Therefore, the claim that the image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, to demand the release of hostages, not coffins of dead Israeli soldiers. The claim misrepresents the context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
