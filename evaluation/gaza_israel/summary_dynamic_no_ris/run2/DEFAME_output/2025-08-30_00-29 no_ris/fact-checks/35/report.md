## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader)) and The Washington Post ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/)) both report that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)) also discusses the airstrikes.

The Washington Post article also mentions concerns about retaliation. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 1367](media/2025-07-20_10-24-1753007097-231567.jpg), ![image 1368](media/2025-07-20_10-24-1753007097-540907.jpg), ![image 1369](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007100-190928.jpg), ![image 1371](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007102-432363.jpg), ![image 1372](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007102-908676.jpg), ![image 1373](media/2025-07-20_10-25-1753007103-413285.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the remains of a ring and a piece of paper (![image 24](media/35.jpg)). One source states that the photo is old and does not belong to Hassan Nasrallah, and that the image was posted on January 5, 2024, while the source is from September 30, 2024. Another source includes a picture of Nasrallah wearing a ring.

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the evidence confirms that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024, the image of the ring's remains is not related to Nasrallah. Multiple sources state that the image is old and does not belong to Nasrallah.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024. However, the image of the ring's remains is not related to Nasrallah. Multiple sources state that the image is old and does not belong to Nasrallah. Therefore, the claim is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While news sources such as [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader) and The Washington Post confirm that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024, the image of the ring's remains is not related to Nasrallah. Multiple sources, including [Kashif](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/09/29/the-ring-photo-is-old-and-does-not-belong-to-hassan-nasrallah/), state that the image is old and does not belong to Nasrallah.
