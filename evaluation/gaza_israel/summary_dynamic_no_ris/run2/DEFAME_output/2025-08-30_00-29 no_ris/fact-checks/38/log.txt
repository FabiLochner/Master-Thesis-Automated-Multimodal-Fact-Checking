The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the web search confirms the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, the image geolocation suggests a different location than Tehran, Iran, where the assassination occurred. The image search results show other images of buildings damaged by missile strikes, but the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the assassination.

So, the overall veracity is: false
