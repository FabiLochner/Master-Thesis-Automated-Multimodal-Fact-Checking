## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The United Nations published a press release on November 20, 2024, regarding a Security Council meeting where the resolution failed to pass due to a US veto.

The provided sources do not mention the US reinstituting the draft.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focus on the US vetoing a UN resolution regarding a ceasefire in Gaza.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results discuss the US vetoing a UN resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war but do not mention the US reinstituting the draft.

The claim is not supported by the provided evidence. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results, including articles from the UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216)), Security Council Report, and a UN press release, focus on the US's actions regarding a UN resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, specifically a veto. However, none of the provided sources mention the US reinstituting the draft.
