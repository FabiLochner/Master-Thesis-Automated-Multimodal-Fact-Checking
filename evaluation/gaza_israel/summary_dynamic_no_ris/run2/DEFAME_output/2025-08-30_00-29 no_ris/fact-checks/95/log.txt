Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/myanmar-earthquake-death-toll-monsoon-rain-forecast-mandalay-sagaing):

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/man-rescued-from-rubble-five-days-after-myanmar-earthquake/article69404754.ece): 
Content: The Hindu published an article on April 2, 2025, about a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar. The article includes a photograph of an earthquake survivor being treated by medical personnel <image:9948>. The article also mentions a man rescued from the rubble five days after the earthquake. The article states that the earthquake also caused the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok.

The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image likely depicts a scene in Turkey, not Gaza, and is unrelated to an Israeli bombing, as suggested by the geolocation data and search results. The claim is further contradicted by the fact that the image is not related to the events described in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
