The article includes images of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles (<image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>). The article was published on June 19, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

The Associated Press article also supports the claim by mentioning high interception rates, although it does not provide specific numbers for the October 1, 2024 attack.
