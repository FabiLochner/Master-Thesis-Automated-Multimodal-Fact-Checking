## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force, is the subject of reports. One source mentions reports of Qaani being killed in Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, but these were not confirmed, and a video from June 24, 2025, showed him in Tehran (<image:k>). Another source reports Qaani appeared in Tehran during celebrations, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination (<image:0>). A third source reports on a post denying rumors of ties to Esmail Qaani (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani), [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018), and [https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504).


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Reports indicate that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, which is after the alleged April 2025 date of him fleeing to Israel. There is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel.


## Final Judgement
The search results show conflicting information about Esmail Qaani's whereabouts. While there were reports of his death and appearances in Tehran, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including reports of Qaani appearing in Tehran in June 2025, contradicts the assertion that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel. There is no evidence to support the claim.
