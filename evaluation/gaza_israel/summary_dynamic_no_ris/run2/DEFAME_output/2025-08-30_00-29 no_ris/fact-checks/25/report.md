## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While Keir Starmer has commented on the situation in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and stating that Israel is exterminating Palestinians, none of the provided articles mention a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer has made statements about the situation in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and criticizing Israel's actions. However, none of the provided evidence mentions a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel.

`false`
