Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/video/hezbollah-attack-on-israel-today-benjamin-netanyahu-on-bus-explosions-in-israel-mass-attack-905564): 
Content: The search result from NDTV, published on February 21, 2025, discusses a Hezbollah attack on Israel and mentions Benjamin Netanyahu. The article does not contain any images of Netanyahu's office.

The claim '<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
