The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the search results confirm the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like NPR and Al Jazeera, they do not contain the image of tents engulfed in flames.
