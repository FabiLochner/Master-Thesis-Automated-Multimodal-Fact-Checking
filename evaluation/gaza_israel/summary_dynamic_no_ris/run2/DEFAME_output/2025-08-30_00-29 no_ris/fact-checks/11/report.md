## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on October 14, 2024, discussing a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base, which resulted in the death of four soldiers and injuries to over 60 others. The article also includes a statement from IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi (<image:k>). The Yahoo News article, published on October 18, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack, stating that Halevi was not killed and made a public appearance a day after the claim was shared (![image 9229](media/2025-08-30_00-34-1756514080-484877.jpg)).

The Times of Israel reports that on October 13, 2024, a Hezbollah drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, which the Prime Minister’s Office described as an attempted assassination. The article mentions that IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi defended the IDF’s response to the attack (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated is false. The Yahoo News article explicitly states that Halevi was not killed and made a public appearance after the claim was shared. Additionally, the Times of Israel reported that Halevi defended the IDF's response to a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including Yahoo News and The Times of Israel, contradict the claim by reporting that Herzi Halevi was not assassinated and was, in fact, present and active after the alleged attack.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack is false. A Yahoo News article explicitly states that Halevi was not killed and made a public appearance after the claim was shared. Furthermore, The Times of Israel reported Halevi's involvement in defending the IDF's response to a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024.
