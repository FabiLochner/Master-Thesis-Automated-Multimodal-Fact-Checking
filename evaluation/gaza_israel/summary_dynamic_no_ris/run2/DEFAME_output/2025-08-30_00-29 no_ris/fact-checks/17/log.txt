Useful result: From [Source](https://gcaptain.com/u-s-flagged-containership-targeted-by-flying-object-in-gulf-of-aden/): 
Content: The search result from gCaptain.com reports that a U.S.-flagged containership, the _Maersk Sentosa_, was targeted by a "flying object" in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024. The vessel and crew are safe. The UKMTO reported the incident. Maersk confirmed the attack. The Houthis claimed responsibility. <image:961> shows a tanker.

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported by evidence. Multiple sources, including The Columbian ([Source](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/)) and gCaptain.com, confirm that a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility. However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, nor does it confirm the exact location of the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
