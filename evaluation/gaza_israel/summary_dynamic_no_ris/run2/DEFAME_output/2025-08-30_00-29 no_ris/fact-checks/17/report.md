## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. The attack was carried out by Yemen's Houthi rebels. The Columbian reports the attack occurred on July 9, 2024, while Reuters reports the attack occurred on July 19, 2024. The evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson.

The evidence does not provide information about the exact location of the attack within the Gulf of Aden, nor does it confirm the statement about the attack being at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, nor does it confirm the exact location of the attack.

Since the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but lacks confirmation of the statement from the Maersk spokesperson, the most appropriate decision is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported by evidence. Multiple sources, including The Columbian ([Source](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/)) and gCaptain.com, confirm that a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024, with the Houthis claiming responsibility. However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, nor does it confirm the exact location of the attack.
