Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

“Israel was also pursuing \[a\] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added.

Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”

Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”

Wood said Iran has to comply with existing Security Council resolutions or face additional measures.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it is closely monitoring the rapidly developing regional situation, and expressing deep concern over the ongoing escalation and its implications for security and stability in the region, in a statement posted by the Emirati state news agency WAM on Wednesday.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in the past day, following the killing by Israel of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.

@Amnesty International

Responding to a **Forbidden Stories-led** [investigation](https://forbiddenstories.org/actualites_posts/israel-maneuvered-to-prevent-disclosure-of-state-secrets-amid-whatsapp-vs-nso-lawsuit/)
, supported by the Amnesty International’s Security Lab, on the government of Israel’s attempts to sway WhatsApp’s ongoing US [lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6532395-WhatsApp-complaint.html)
 against [spyware firm NSO Group](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/search/nso%20group/)
, Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of the [Security Lab](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/)
 at Amnesty International, said:  

“These revelations raise critical concerns about Israel’s regulatory oversight and the impartiality of its investigations into the spyware maker.  

“Israel has a duty to ensure Israeli companies do not cause or contribute to human rights violations anywhere in the world. As part of court procedures, [NSO Group was facing a potential discovery process](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/03/us-spyware-ruling-a-welcome-step-towards-accountability-for-those-targeted-with-nso-spyware/)
, a pretrial procedure whereby information, such as internal documents, can be requested to be produced in court. 

The Forbidden Stories-led consortium story reveals how Israeli authorities took steps to seize NSO Group documents in efforts to protect them from discovery in a US court during this pretrial procedure and sought to censor information related to WhatsApp’s lawsuit against NSO Group. 

Apparently, Israel’s government feared this process could have led to the disclosure of sensitive information about NSO Group and the activities of NSO Group’s customers. 

The investigation draws on leaked files published online and reviewed by Forbidden Stories and their media partners, as well as additional documents and sources. These documents suggest that not only are they failing to do this but are actively trying to shield NSO Group from accountability for its role in severe human rights violations. 

“Such revelations call into question Israel’s commitment to impartially regulate NSO Group and casts doubt on its ability to provide justice, truth and reparation to those affected by Pegasus spyware.  

“It further confirms the difficulty in seeing Israel as an independent adjudicator capable of meaningfully exercising its responsibilities to control the highly invasive spyware industry, which poses serious human rights risks, or of offering redress to victims of spyware through its own courts.”

NSO Group, an Israeli private company, has been under scrutiny for its surveillance technology products, particularly the highly invasive [Pegasus](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/case-study-the-pegasus-project/)
 spyware, which is used by governments globally to target human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers, and politicians, among others. This may be the final option for victims, who seldom have avenues for effective remedy in jurisdictions which abuse or export spyware tools. 

In 2021, Amnesty International and Forbidden Stories revealed how NSO Group’s [spyware was used to facilitate human rights violations around the world](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/case-study-the-pegasus-project/)
 targeting potentially tens of thousands of phone numbers, including those of heads of state, activists and journalists – among them the family of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 

**Background:**   
------------------

WhatsApp sued NSO Group in California’s 9th District Court in October 2019 for allegedly abusing its platform to hack the phones of 1,400 people around the world. Technical indicators in other files from the leak, including PDFs and Microsoft Word documents cited by Forbidden Stories in their piece, were reviewed and do not show obvious signs of having been tampered with. 

Amnesty International and seven other civil society groups filed an [Amicus brief](https://www.accessnow.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-22-AccessNow-Amicus-Brief13845453.1.pdf)
 related to WhatsApp’s case against NSO Group in December 2020 asking a California District Court not to grant NSO Group immunity from prosecution for harms suffered by those targeted with spyware. 

The matter is still before the court."

Similar spy tools – which allow remote access to mobile devices without the victim’s knowledge – have been discovered on the phones of journalists, activists, and at least 50 US officials, raising concerns about the unchecked proliferation of spyware technology.

 to spy on activists, journalists, and even heads of state.

Paragon, which was co-founded by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, was reportedly sold to a US private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, for $900m in 2024.

The company’s website advertises “ethically based tools, teams, and insights to disrupt intractable threats”.

Natalia Krapiva, senior tech-legal counsel at the advocacy group Access Now, said Paragon had the reputation of being a more responsible spyware company, “but WhatsApp’s recent revelations suggest otherwise”.

“This is not just a question of some bad apples — these types of abuses \[are\] a feature of the commercial spyware industry,” she told Reuters.

Reuters said that AE did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

The official declined to say who, specifically, was targeted but confirmed that WhatsApp is referring targets to the Canadian internet watchdog group Citizen Lab.

He declined to say how WhatsApp ascertained that Paragon was responsible for the breach. He said law enforcement and industry partners had been informed, but would not go into detail.

In a statement, WhatsApp said the company “will continue to protect people’s ability to communicate privately”.

WhatsApp also told the United Kingdom’s Guardian newspaper that it had “high confidence” the users in question had been targeted and “possibly compromised”.

Paragon declined to comment.

Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton told Reuters that the discovery of Paragon spyware targeting WhatsApp users “is a reminder that mercenary spyware continues to proliferate and as it does, so we continue to see familiar patterns of problematic use”.

Revealed: Israeli military creating ChatGPT-like tool using vast collection of Palestinian surveillance data
============================================================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

The powerful new AI model is designed to analyze intercepted communications – but experts say such systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes

Israel’s military surveillance agency has used a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian communications to build a powerful artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT that it hopes will transform its spying capabilities, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal.

The joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found Unit 8200 trained the AI model to understand spoken Arabic using large volumes of telephone conversations and text messages, obtained through its extensive surveillance of the occupied territories.

According to sources familiar with the project, the unit began building the model to create a sophisticated chatbot-like tool capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring and providing insights into the massive volumes of surveillance data it collects.

The elite eavesdropping agency, comparable in its capabilities with the US National Security Agency (NSA), accelerated its development of the system after the start of the war in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 in October 2023. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”

Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.

The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.

Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.

Initially, Israeli military intelligence struggled to build a model on this scale. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.

 their own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.

But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.

One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.

Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.

Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining \[an\] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.

Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.

Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.

In February, the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108)
 AI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls.

The efforts to build the large language model (LLM) – a deep learning system that generates human-like text – were partially revealed in a little-noticed public talk by a former military intelligence technologist who said he oversaw the project.

“We tried to create the largest dataset possible \[and\] collect all the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic,” the former official, Chaked Roger Joseph Sayedoff, told an audience at a military AI conference in Tel Aviv last year."

([https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/israels-attempt-to-sway-whatsapp-case-casts-doubt-on-its-ability-to-deal-with-nso-spyware-cases/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/israels-attempt-to-sway-whatsapp-case-casts-doubt-on-its-ability-to-deal-with-nso-spyware-cases/)) and ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/31/whatsapp-says-its-users-targeted-by-israeli-spyware-company-paragon](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/31/whatsapp-says-its-users-targeted-by-israeli-spyware-company-paragon)).

The Guardian discusses the Israeli military's use of AI to analyze intercepted communications, mentioning Unit 8200 and its development of a ChatGPT-like tool, as well as the use of surveillance data (<image:9895>, <image:9896>). ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance))


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel has used spyware and AI for surveillance, including the use of Pegasus spyware and a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze intercepted communications. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024. While the evidence suggests the capability and potential use of such methods, there is no direct confirmation.

The Amnesty International and Al Jazeera articles discuss the use of spyware on WhatsApp users, including journalists and civil society members, but do not mention Haniyeh. The CNN article confirms that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

Your Message Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel has used spyware and AI for surveillance, including the use of Pegasus spyware and a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze intercepted communications. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024. While the evidence suggests the capability and potential use of such methods, there is no direct confirmation.

The Amnesty International and Al Jazeera articles discuss the use of spyware on WhatsApp users, including journalists and civil society members, but do not mention Haniyeh. The CNN article confirms that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel has used spyware and AI for surveillance, including the use of Pegasus spyware and a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze intercepted communications. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024. While the evidence suggests the capability and potential use of such methods, there is no direct confirmation.

The Amnesty International and Al Jazeera articles discuss the use of spyware on WhatsApp users, including journalists and civil society members, but do not mention Haniyeh. The CNN article confirms that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Has Israel issued such warnings before?
---------------------------------------

During the current war, Israel has so far dropped pamphlets to alert Lebanese border communities of an impending bombing campaign.

But it has in the past also been accused of hacking Lebanese telecommunications networks.

In 2018, Amal Mudallali, Lebanon’s permanent representative to the United Nations, [accused](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n18/437/18/pdf/n1843718.pdf)
 Israel of hacking mobile lines and sending recorded messages to civilians in Kafr Kila village, warning them of imminent explosions amid [tensions](/features/2018/12/22/lebanons-border-tense-as-israel-excavates-hezbollah-tunnels)
 between Hezbollah and Israel that year.

“This constitutes a new and extremely serious attack on the security and safety of the citizens of Lebanon, whereby Israel is violating the dignity and privacy of individuals and making a direct threat against their lives,” Mudallali wrote in a letter to the UN Security Council, asking for condemnation of Israel’s “hostile” behaviour.

Israel is also known for its [strong](/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-pagers-explode-has-israel-carried-out-such-attacks-before)
 capabilities in breaking into electronic devices using malware.

Pegasus, one type of such malware, was developed by the Israeli company NSO Group and has been used by multiple countries [to spy](/news/2022/2/8/what-you-need-to-know-about-israeli-spyware-pegasus)
 on their citizens, according to a 2021 investigation by Amnesty International, Forbidden Stories and a host of media houses.

Illegal data gathering in Lebanon likely dates back to 2007, when Mossad spy networks’ focus on communications systems were first uncovered in Lebanon, Magnier said. 7 Hamas attack,” Ori Goldberg, an Israeli academic, wrote in the publication New Lines Magazine.

Is Lebanon’s data privacy framework weak?
-----------------------------------------

As powerful as Israel’s technological capabilities are, weaknesses in Lebanon’s data security structures haven’t helped its citizens either, experts and privacy rights groups say.

At times, Lebanese state actors have themselves contributed to data breaches.

Lebanese embassies reportedly exposed the personal data of thousands of Lebanese citizens in the diaspora who had registered to vote in the run-up to the 2018 general election, [according](https://privacyinternational.org/state-privacy/1081/state-privacy-lebanon)
 to the monitoring website Privacy International.

In the same year, the Lebanese security intelligence agency was found to have run several hacking campaigns since 2012, stealing thousands of gigabytes of data from users of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to researchers from the mobile security firm Look Up and the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation. ![Israel strikes wide swaths of southern Lebanon](/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AFP__20240923__36GY82V__v2__Preview__LebanonIsraelPalestinianConflict-1727086401.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Israeli military officials have warned residents in southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut to evacuate villages and neighbourhoods, sparking worries of a bombing campaign exploding into a full-blown war — and concerns that Israel had hacked into its northern neighbour’s telecommunications networks.

The bombing began within hours of Monday’s warnings, and more than 270 people have been killed in attacks across Lebanon’s south and east.

And later in the evening, Israel announced that it had also bombed parts of Beirut.

As fears of a war escalate, the warnings, experts say, are in themselves also a reminder of Israel’s technological superiority over Lebanon. The messages were all the same, he said.

One message seen by Al Jazeera was delivered at about 8:20am \[05:30 GMT\] and read: “If you are in a building with Hezbollah weapons, stay away from the village until further notice.”

Radio broadcasts were also hacked to deliver the messages, Al Jazeera correspondents reported on Monday.

“We ask residents of Lebanese villages to pay attention to the message and warning published by the \[Israeli military\] and heed them,” Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a video statement posted on the X platform early on Monday.

Ibrahim from Al Jazeera said the areas people were asked to evacuate have already witnessed high levels of displacement since October 8, the day Israel and Lebanon began trading fire.

“These are communities that have seen more than 100,000 people leave in the 11 months of war,” he said. … Is it because of data leaks or because Israel has hacked into Lebanon’s telecoms infrastructure?” Ibrahim said.

Are these more than warnings?
-----------------------------

Israel says its army sends warnings before bombings to minimise civilian casualties. In other cases in Gaza, fleeing civilians have been attacked by Israeli forces.

The warnings can come in the form of text messages, phone calls or dropped leaflets. While Israel didn’t claim responsibility, most experts concluded it was behind those explosions.

While experts believe Israel planted explosives in those devices months before they were detonated, the ability to send targeted warnings to individuals in specific parts of Lebanon suggests that Israel has access to real-time information about Lebanese civilians — not just its supposed enemies in Hezbollah.

That’s not surprising, said Elijah Magnier, a risk and conflict analyst.

Magnier, who closely watches Israel’s conflicts in the Middle East, told Al Jazeera that Israel had hacked Lebanese networks way before October 8.

“They have access to landlines, car plate numbers, mobile phones — to the point that they are able to communicate to anyone in the south of Lebanon exactly as they are able to do in the West Bank or Gaza,” he said.

Sophisticated spyware technology and equipment means that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency can map exactly who lives where, what phone numbers they have and who frequents their homes, Magnier said.

Spies, he added, can collect thousands of IP addresses in towns and cities just by driving on the streets with their equipment. Those revelations came in the wake of the July 2006 war between Lebanon and Israel, which caused 1,191 to 1,300 Lebanese casualties and another 165 Israeli fatalities. Since then, more communication network spies have been discovered.

“Israel enjoys complete intelligence superiority over its regional enemies — even if it missed the Oct. While the 1999 Telecommunications Act protects people against surveillance and tapping (except in criminal investigations), a 2013 directive also requires internet service providers, cafes and other internet-enabled stores to keep user data for at least a year.

This month, Lebanese publications reported increasing cases of attempted WhatsApp hacking, with people receiving messages to click on suspicious codes and links and then receiving alerts that their WhatsApp had been opened on another device."

([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp))

A CNN article reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Amnesty International discusses Israel's attempts to protect NSO Group from accountability in a lawsuit related to WhatsApp, mentioning the use of Pegasus spyware (<image:9894>). Al Jazeera reports that WhatsApp said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions targeted 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society, and that Paragon was sold to a US private equity firm in 2024.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel has used spyware and AI for surveillance, including the use of Pegasus spyware and a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze intercepted communications. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024. While the evidence suggests the capability and potential use of such methods, there is no direct confirmation.

The Amnesty International and Al Jazeera articles discuss the use of spyware on WhatsApp users, including journalists and civil society members, but do not mention Haniyeh. The CNN article confirms that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3

The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:63>)
web_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida Al-Nuseirat refugee camp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image <image:63>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

The UNRWA Media Advisor Adnan Abu Hasna told Al Jazeera he estimated that the number of displaced people sheltering at the school stood at 2000 however this figure was far too low according to other experts on the ground.

Director of Logistics at Civil Defense told Al Jazeera that the number of families at the school was 1,200 with around 7000 people.

 since the strikes were carried out at a time when children go out to play in the yards at the school to escape the heat of the classrooms.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:63>)
web_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida Al-Nuseirat refugee camp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image <image:63>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/global-outcry-over-israels-targeting-of-palestinian-children): 
Content: "This is not the first time we have been targeted by the Israeli authorities.

“Previously they would attack through proxy, pro-Israel organisations trying to slander us and undermine our reputation with our partners and donors but that never worked,” Abu Eqtaish told Al Jazeera.

Manal Tamimi, an activist from another family of Nabi Saleh’s Tamimi clan, said children in the village were regularly targeted and some of this targeting was to punish their parents for their political activism.

Manal’s husband Bilal has been regularly assaulted by Israeli soldiers for documenting their abuses during previous clashes with Palestinian youths in the village.

Several years ago, Manal was shot in the leg with live ammunition at the beginning of one demonstration.

“I was warned on my Facebook page prior to the protest that my blood would be spilled that day and at the beginning of the protest I was shot in the leg with a .22 bullet, which caused the bone to break,” she told Al Jazeera.

Her son Osama was previously imprisoned for nine months for allegedly taking part in protests.

However, it was the arrest and detention of her son Samer several years ago, when he was 11 years old, that really stressed the family.

“Samer and two other boys of the same age were arrested from Nabi Saleh and another village,” said Manal.

“The soldiers had come into the village, despite everything being quiet and they snatched two of the boys when they were near the supermarket and put them into a military jeep.

“I and several other women tried to physically stop the jeep but we couldn’t.

“We then went to the military checkpoint at the entrance of the village and shouted at the soldiers to tell us where the boys were but they wouldn’t.

“My husband and I were extremely worried as we didn’t know where he was or whether he’d been injured.”

Blindfolds and handcuffs
------------------------

Samer recalled his frightening experience.

“I was blindfolded and handcuffed and taken to a military base where we were all made to sit on the floor for six hours and questioned,” Samer told Al Jazeera.

During this time, none of the boys was given any food or water, and neither were their blindfolds or handcuffs removed.

Samer was also shown a video by the soldiers of his mother protesting at the checkpoint to frighten him. The boys were eventually released later that night following intervention by Palestinian officials.

“But now my son has a file and he is not allowed to cross through Israeli checkpoints even though he is only 15,” said Manal.

Manal said about 85 children from the village had been arrested over the years, 10 of them under 15. “More than 500 villagers had also been wounded, and five people were killed.”

She said soldiers in the village made life hard for the children by erecting regular checkpoints and stopping children from going to school, in addition to the beatings and arrests.

‘Willful killings’
------------------

On July 28, Muhammad Abu Sara, 11, [died from a gunshot](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_and_kill_11_year_old_palestinian_boy_in_hebron)
 wound to the chest after Israeli soldiers fired 13 rounds at his father’s car in the Palestinian village of Beit Ummar in the southern West Bank.

Again, there were no clashes in the village that day.

The Israeli soldiers said the vehicle failed to stop when ordered to do so. But Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP) said that under international law, intentional lethal force was only justified in circumstances where a direct threat to life or of serious injury was present.

“However, investigations and evidence collected by DCIP regularly suggest that Israeli forces use lethal force against Palestinian children in circumstances that may amount to extrajudicial or willful killings,” said DCIP.

On Tuesday, a 15-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli live fire in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian health ministry said Imad Khaled Saleh Hashash died after sustaining a gunshot wound to the head.

The deaths of the three boys were among 12 children killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank this year, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

Another 67 children were killed in Gaza during Israel’s attack in May.

According to DCIP, seven children were killed in Gaza and the West Bank in 2020.

‘Rights of children’
--------------------

This spike in the number of child fatalities, and a raid on the DCIP offices in Al Bireh by Israeli security forces at the end of July, led human rights experts from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to call on the Israeli government to “immediately return confidential documents and office equipment that its military seized from the offices of the DCIP”.

“We are deeply concerned by the Israeli military’s interference with the human rights work of a well-known and well-regarded NGO,” said the experts.

Computers, hard drives, binders and other materials were taken from DCIP’s offices during the nighttime raid.

“The indispensable work of Palestinian, Israeli and international civil society organisations has provided a measure of much-needed accountability in documenting and scrutinising the dispiriting human rights trends in the occupied Palestinian territory,” OHCHR said.

DCIP provided critical and reliable reporting on the patterns of arrests, maimings, and killings of Palestinian children by the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza, the organisation added.

“All civilian lives under occupation are protected under international law. ![Palestine air strike 16 july 2014](/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a04f5e23c755494ab522d6d44b31f181_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

**Nabi Saleh, Occupied West Bank** – “Mama, mama where is Muhammad?” an agitated Omar Tamimi, 3, repeatedly asked his mother.

Trying hard not to break down in front of her children, Bara’a Tamimi, from the village of Nabi Saleh, near Ramallah, tried to comfort her son before breaking down and weeping.

 three times with live ammunition.

“We rushed him to hospital but he died less than an hour after he was shot. They couldn’t save him,” Bara’a told Al Jazeera.

There were no clashes in the village that day on July 23, but Israeli soldiers had been coming into the village on an almost daily basis and provoking the locals, shooting tear gas canisters into homes and swearing at the villagers.

Nabi Saleh is home to about 600 people, mostly from the Tamimi clan, and has a history of activism, which included regular Friday protests in the past.

“Muhammad was in the backyard when the soldiers shot tear gas into our home, forcing me to take the other young children into the inner rooms of the home for their safety,” said Bara’a as she recalled the events leading up to Muhammad’s killing.

“A verbal confrontation then ensued between Muhammad and the soldiers before he later went out to look for one of his brothers who has cancer in one of his eyes and can’t see properly. This is particularly true for the rights of children,” the OHCHR experts said.

Mayar and Bilal are two children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida. They were though attached to each other always playing together and having fun at home while enjoying the love of their parents. 

All those who knew Mayar said she was a smart girl as she excelled in her school subjects and was dreaming of becoming a journalist just like her father but the Israeli hideous bombardment ended her dream by killing her along with her brother Bilal and their mother in October 2023. 

Their father who has been covering the Israeli aggression on Gaza as many other journalists was left alone to continue his job with grief and pain for his great loss and concern over losing more of his family members. 

Since October 7 Israel has been waging a heinous genocide in Gaza Strip via air ground and sea attacks resulting in more than 40000 martyrs wounded and missing people. 

“We Are Not Numbers” is a series that reviews part of the available stories of some Palestinian martyrs who have fallen in the Israeli aggression on Gaza.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since October 7 and the besieged enclave faces dire shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

On Saturday, dozens of Palestinians, [including five journalists](/news/2024/7/6/five-journalists-killed-as-israel-steps-up-bombardment-across-gaza)

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said hundreds of Palestinian families had sought shelter at the school after they were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza.

The families “chose the middle area \[of the Gaza Strip\] because Israeli forces said the middle area is a safe zone”, Khoudary said.

“Everyone in the Gaza Strip believes that they are not safe, wherever they go.”

Last month, an Israeli attack on an UN-linked school – also in Nuseirat refugee camp – [killed at least 40 people](/news/2024/6/6/israel-bombs-unrwa-school-in-gaza-kills-32-displaced-palestinians)
 and injured dozens more, according to local authorities.

Musab, a 17-year-old survivor of the early June bombing of the UNRWA Nuseirat Boys’ Preparatory School, told the UN agency that his father was killed after “missiles rained down” on the family.

“Concrete slabs fell on us, and suddenly, we found ourselves surrounded by the dead and injured. All of my family members were either injured or killed,” [Musab said](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/no-shelter-war-bombing-block-2-unrwa-nuseirat-school)
 in testimony shared by UNRWA.

“We were sleeping, and at two in the morning, missiles rained down on us. A young boy could be seen sifting through pools of blood on the ground.

Footage shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir el-Balah and verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency also showed children and young people being rushed from ambulances.

They included a girl with a bandaged arm, another with a bloodied face and a boy bandage across his head. They pulled us from under the rubble, and all we saw were shrapnel, debris, and dust. How will we live?”

Gaza: Deaths and devastation during hostage rescue operation show ‘seismic trauma’ of ongoing war
=================================================================================================

9 June 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The scenes of devastation witnessed in the aftermath of Israel’s military operation to release hostages from the Nuseirat refugee camp proves that each day the war continues “it only grows more horrific” the UN’s [top humanitarian official](https://www.unocha.org/our-leadership/martin-griffiths)
 said on Sunday.

According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 270 people including children and other non-combatants were killed during intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp on Saturday, in the middle area of the war-torn enclave. More than 40 of the hostages are believed to have died so far with more than 110 reportedly remaining.

**Healthcare ‘hanging by a thread’**
------------------------------------

“Seeing bloodied patients being treated on hospital floors, **we are reminded that healthcare in Gaza is hanging by a thread**.”

Video from Al-Aqsa Hospital in the aftermath of the fighting and bombardment shows numerous casualties lying on the floor while the director of Al-Adwa Hospital in Nuseirat reported that no morgue is available at the hospital to house the bodies of the dead.

Negotiations continue for a comprehensive ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas but a United States-led proposal presented on 31 May has not been accepted by either side.

Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said [in a post on X](https://twitter.com/UNReliefChief/status/1799628590323003821)
 that the Nuseirat camp “is **the epicentre of the seismic trauma that civilians in Gaza continue to suffer**.”

> [](https://twitter.com/UN_News_Centre/statuses/1799899971514220726)

“Seeing shrouded bodies on the ground, we are reminded that **nowhere is safe** in Gaza”, he continued.

Saturday's carnage followed on from [an Israeli attack on a UN school](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/06/1150721)
 building-turned shelter in the same area on Thursday, which left dozens dead. This collective agony can and must end now.”

The emergency relief chief added that seeing the video footage from the scene of shrouded bodies in Nuseirat camp was a reminder that nowhere is safe in the enclave, where Israel has carried out a nine months long offensive since the Hamas-led terror attacks of 7 October.

Palestinian militants took over 250 hostage in southern Israel that day, massacring some 1,200 people. All of them must be released.”

[In a tweet](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1799463765634941127)
 on Saturday following news of the hostages being freed, UN chief António Guterres said he had sent messages to the relatives of Noa Argamani and Shalomi Ziv - some of whose family members he had received at the UN last week - to express his relief.

“**I renew my appeal for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and for an end to this war**”, said the Secretary-General.

Mr. Local officials reported that 37 people were killed in the school building attack, including 14 children.

**Scores of hostages still held**
---------------------------------

The Humanitarian Affairs chief said that even as the four hostages were reunited with their families in Israel thanks to the military operation “scores are still being held captive. Griffiths asserted that “all civilians must be protected."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:63>)
web_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida Al-Nuseirat refugee camp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image <image:63>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.
