Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/footage-shows-hezbollah-drone-from-lebanon-being-shot-down-by-iaf-helicopter-south-of-haifa/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that an Israeli Air Force attack helicopter shot down a Hezbollah drone in the Binyamina area, south of Haifa. The article includes footage of the event.

The claim '<image:6> This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image is associated with the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon in November 2024, as confirmed by multiple sources, including a [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-deal-gaza-war-11-27-24-intl-hnk) that includes the image and reports on the ceasefire on November 27, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the helicopter was shot down.

So, the overall veracity is: false
