## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Sky News shows an image of a burning tank (![image 9603](media/2025-08-30_01-00-1756515634-186631.jpg)). The website vpk.name also shows an image of a burning tank (![image 9604](media/2025-08-30_01-00-1756515634-670212.jpg)).

The source kashif.ps discusses an old photo being circulated as showing the destruction of an Israeli military tank (![image 9605](media/2025-08-30_01-00-1756515635-544988.jpg)).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Pakistan': 0.11, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Israel': 0.1, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Mexico': 0.06, 'Colombia': 0.05, 'Chile': 0.04, 'Sweden': 0.03, 'Argentina': 0.02, 'Denmark': 0.02}

## Elaboration
The image search results show other images of burning tanks, but they do not confirm the details of the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image could have been taken in Palestine or Israel, but this is not definitive. The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

The claim mentions an ambush by Hamas fighters near Jabalia camp in northern Gaza in October 2024. The evidence does not contain any information about the date, location, or the actors involved in the event.

To verify the claim, information about the specific event, including the date, location, and the parties involved, is needed.
