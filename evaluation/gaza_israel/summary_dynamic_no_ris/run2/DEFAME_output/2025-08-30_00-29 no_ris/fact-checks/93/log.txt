The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the image was likely taken in Israel, and a Houthi attack occurred in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts people fleeing the airport due to the attack. The initial evidence confirmed the attack ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), but subsequent searches did not provide a direct link between the attack and the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
