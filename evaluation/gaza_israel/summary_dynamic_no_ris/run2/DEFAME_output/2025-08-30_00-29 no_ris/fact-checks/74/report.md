### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216). The attack was part of the ongoing Israeli–Lebanese conflict and was claimed by Hezbollah. Netanyahu and his wife were not present, and there were no injuries.

The attack was described as an assassination attempt. The drone hit a structure in the area, causing damage to a bedroom window. <image:i>, ![image 5540](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913514-658764.jpg), ![image 5541](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913515-076396.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o)) reported on a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024, stating that Netanyahu and his wife were not at home and no one was injured. The Israeli military said three drones were launched from Lebanon, with one hitting a building in Caesarea. Netanyahu said the attack was an attempt by Hezbollah to assassinate him and his wife. ![image 9749](media/2025-08-30_01-11-1756516270-294263.jpg)

CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk)) reported on a drone strike on October 22, 2024, that damaged Benjamin Netanyahu's beach house in Caesarea, Israel. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack. The article mentions that Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time and no one was injured. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that no one was injured. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.


## Final Judgement
The drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel. While the attack did occur, and was claimed by Hezbollah, the evidence from multiple sources confirms that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and no one was injured. The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is demonstrably false.

`false`
