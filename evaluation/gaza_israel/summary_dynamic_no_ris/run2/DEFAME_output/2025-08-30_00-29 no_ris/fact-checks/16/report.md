## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-812636): 
Content: The search result from JPost.com states that viral images of Israeli Olympians advocating to 'Bring them home' are not from the Olympics. The article includes an image of the athletes. ![image 14](media/16.jpg) The article was published on July 31, 2024, and updated on August 7, 2024.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" in a pool because they were not allowed to wear their yellow "Bring Them Home" pins at the Olympic games. However, the image is not from the 2024 Olympics.

The sources include an image of synchronized swimmers in a pool from [Ynetnews.com](https://www.ynetnews.com/culture/article/skmg5e5ma) and an article about the image of the Israeli Olympic team from [THV11](https://www.thv11.com/article/news/verify/olympics-verify/image-israeli-swimmers-bring-them-home-not-from-paris-2024-olympics/536-5f25fcff-c857-495b-8eba-3d6c5fb46ce9). The New York Times also published an article about synchronized swimming at the Olympics. ![image 5919](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-064484.jpg) ![image 5920](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-610559.jpg) ![image 5921](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495996-987880.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image of the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" is not from the 2024 Olympics. The evidence from both web and image searches confirms this. The image was shared online, and the articles from JPost.com and THV11.com explicitly state that the image is not from the Olympics.


## Final Judgement
The image of the Israeli Olympic team spelling out "Bring Them Home" is not from the 2024 Olympics. Multiple sources confirm that the image is not from the Olympics, and the claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`
