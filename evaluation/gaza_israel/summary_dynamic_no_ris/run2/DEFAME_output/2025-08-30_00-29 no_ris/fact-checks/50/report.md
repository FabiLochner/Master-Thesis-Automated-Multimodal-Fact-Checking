```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and Harvard University ([Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)) discuss DNA testing in Israel within the context of the Israeli Law of Return, specifically regarding the determination of Jewish identity for immigration. A 1998 article from Nature.com ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)) mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is relevant to Israeli law, particularly concerning Jewish identity and immigration.
2.  A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel existed.
3.  The evidence does not explicitly state that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim's veracity cannot be determined with the provided evidence. More information is needed to ascertain whether DNA testing is illegal in Israel.


## Actions
```
web_search("DNA testing restrictions Israel")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
1.  The existing evidence focuses on the use of DNA testing in the context of immigration and potential restrictions on genetic information.
2.  The search for additional information about restrictions did not yield any new evidence.
3.  The evidence does not confirm or deny the legality of DNA testing in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim's veracity cannot be determined.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/): 
Content: PZ-Law.co.il discusses repatriation to Israel via DNA tests to prove Jewishness for immigration purposes. The article states that DNA tests can be used if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. It also mentions that DNA test results from other laboratories might not be recognized.


## Elaboration
1.  The new evidence from PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)) indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel for immigration purposes, specifically to prove Jewishness.
2.  The article suggests that DNA tests are permissible under certain conditions, such as having relatives who are Israeli citizens.
3.  The evidence implies that DNA testing is not universally illegal in Israel, as it is used in specific contexts.

**Conclusion**: The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that DNA tests are used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes, implying they are not universally illegal. The PZ-Law.co.il article indicates that DNA tests can be used to prove Jewishness for immigration if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. This contradicts the claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)) indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel for immigration purposes, specifically to prove Jewishness, suggesting that DNA testing is not universally illegal.
