Useful result: From [Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/): 
Content: PZ-Law.co.il discusses repatriation to Israel via DNA tests to prove Jewishness for immigration purposes. The article states that DNA tests can be used if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. It also mentions that DNA test results from other laboratories might not be recognized.

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)) indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel for immigration purposes, specifically to prove Jewishness, suggesting that DNA testing is not universally illegal.

So, the overall veracity is: false
