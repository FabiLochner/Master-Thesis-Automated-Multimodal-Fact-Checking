## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image ![image 63](media/96.jpg)

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

Countercurrents.org ([https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/)) reports that Mayar Haidar (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024. The Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/global-outcry-over-israels-targeting-of-palestinian-children](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/global-outcry-over-israels-targeting-of-palestinian-children)) discusses the targeting of Palestinian children by Israeli forces, but does not mention the children in the claim.

Palinfo ([https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/)) reports that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed along with their mother in October 2023 by Israeli airstrikes. ![image 63](media/96.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 6, 2024, Al Jazeera reported that an Israeli attack on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat refugee camp killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured over 75. The attack occurred at al-Jaouni school. The Israeli army stated they struck "several terrorists" in the area. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

A UN News article published on June 9, 2024, discusses an Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where over 270 people, including children, were killed. The article also mentions an Israeli attack on a UN school-turned shelter in the same area on June 6, 2024, which resulted in the deaths of dozens, including 14 children.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Countercurrents.org ([https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/)) reports that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)) also reports an Israeli attack on a UN-run school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, which resulted in casualties. However, Palinfo ([https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/)) reports that the children were killed in October 2023.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but there are conflicting reports regarding the date of the children's deaths.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel on July 6, 2024, is supported by some sources, such as Countercurrents.org and Al Jazeera, which report an Israeli attack on a UN school in the Nuseirat refugee camp on that date. However, Palinfo reports that the children were killed in October 2023.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel on July 6, 2024, is partially supported by evidence. While some sources, like Countercurrents.org ([https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)), support the claim, other sources, such as Palinfo, report the children were killed in October 2023.
