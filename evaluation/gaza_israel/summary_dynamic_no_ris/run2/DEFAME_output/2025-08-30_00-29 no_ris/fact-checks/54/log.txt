Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832): 
Content: Newsweek reports that the State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" from Israel for U.S. citizens and lawful residents.

The article was published on Saturday and mentions the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/): 
Content: CBS News reports that the U.S. State Department has begun assisted departure flights from Israel. The article mentions charter flights from Tel Aviv organized by non-profits and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The U.S. State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. The article also mentions that Birthright Israel evacuated approximately 1,500 program participants.

The claim 'As the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalate in October, 2024, the U.S. government is offering Americans loans to pay for flights out of Lebanon while they have been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year 'on US taxpayers' dime.' is false.
Justification: The U.S. government is providing emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon amid escalating conflict, as well as charter flights for U.S. citizens and lawful residents to leave Israel since October 2023, with repayment expected for the latter, according to sources like [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/). The claim that the U.S. is flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
