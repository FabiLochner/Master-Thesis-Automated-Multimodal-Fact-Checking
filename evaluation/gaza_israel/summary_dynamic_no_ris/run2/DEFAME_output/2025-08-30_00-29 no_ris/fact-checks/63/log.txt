Useful result: From [Source](https://cedmohub.eu/image-of-child-trapped-under-rubble-predates-gaza-war-and-shows-signs-of-ai/): 
Content: The AFP article from November 29, 2023, debunks an image of a child trapped under rubble, claiming it predates the Gaza war and shows signs of AI generation. The image was shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the Gaza war. <image:8856>, <image:8860>, <image:8857>, <image:8858>.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the evidence confirms that children have been found under rubble in Gaza, and the image's geolocation points to Palestine, the specific image and its context cannot be verified. The search results did not return the image, and the claim's details remain unconfirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
