Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82): 
Content: The Associated Press published a fact check stating that there is no evidence to support the claim that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas. The article mentions that the Trump administration and Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, made similar claims. The article refers to a grant from USAID to the International Medical Corps (IMC) worth $102.2 million to provide medical and trauma services in Gaza. Officials said the funding included contraceptives, but the IMC stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms. <image:i> The article also mentions that USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece.

Useful result: From [Source](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/doge-halts-50-million-payment-for-condoms-in-gaza-white-house-says-hamas-israel-trump-administration-government-efficiency-karoline-leavitt): 
Content: The White House announced that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza." The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called it a waste of taxpayer money. DOGE head Elon Musk remarked that the expense was the "tip of the iceberg." The article was published on January 28th, 2025, by The National News Desk. <image:973>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/): 
Content: The Washington Post, written by Glenn Kessler, reports that the White House claimed that $50 million in aid for Gaza via the International Medical Corps was suspended, including "family planning programming including emergency contraception." <image:i> The article mentions that the State Department launched a five-year, $50 million program to improve health care in Gaza. The article also mentions that the White House official declined to say how much money in these contracts related to family planning.

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While the White House stated that a $50 million payment was halted, the Associated Press fact-check found no evidence that the funds were specifically designated for condoms in Gaza ([https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82](https://apnews.com/article/gaza-condoms-fact-check-trump-50-million-26884cac6c7097d7316ca50ca4145a82)).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
