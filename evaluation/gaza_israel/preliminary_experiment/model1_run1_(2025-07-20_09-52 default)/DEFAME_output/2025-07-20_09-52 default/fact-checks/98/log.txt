Useful result: From [Source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/htcity/cinema/gal-gadot-madonna-dwayne-johnson-justin-bieber-celebrities-come-out-to-support-israel-amid-ongoing-conflict-101697024471665.html): 
Content: The Hindustan Times published an article on October 13, 2023, discussing celebrities who have shown support for Israel amid the conflict. The article mentions Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot, and Gigi Hadid, among others. Dwayne Johnson posted a note condemning terrorism. The article does not include the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag.

The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is not enough information.
Justification: The available evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel, as reported by sources like [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/) and [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/htcity/cinema/gal-gadot-madonna-dwayne-johnson-justin-bieber-celebrities-come-out-to-support-israel-amid-ongoing-conflict-101697024471665.html). However, none of the provided sources mention or show the specific image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
