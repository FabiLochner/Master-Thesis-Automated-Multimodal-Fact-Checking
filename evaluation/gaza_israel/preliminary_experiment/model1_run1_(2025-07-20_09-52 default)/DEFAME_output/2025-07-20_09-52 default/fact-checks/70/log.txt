Israel said that the coalition whose defensive efforts were codenamed Iron Shield destroyed 99 percent of the incoming weapons. The Economist noted that the attack appeared to be an attempt to "overwhelm Israel's missile-defence systems by force of numbers," but it "failed almost completely," as "most of the missiles were intercepted and destroyed in mid-air."
