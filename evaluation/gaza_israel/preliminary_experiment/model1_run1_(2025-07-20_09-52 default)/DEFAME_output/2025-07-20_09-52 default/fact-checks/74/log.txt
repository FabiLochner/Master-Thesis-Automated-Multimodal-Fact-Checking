The claim 'Netanyahu’s son Yair was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024 that targeted the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea, Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, in Caesarea, Israel, multiple sources ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)) state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The provided evidence does not support the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
