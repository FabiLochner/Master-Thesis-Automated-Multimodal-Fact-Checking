## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Al-Monitor article, published on January 16, 2025, discusses the destruction in Gaza, stating that by December 1, 2024, nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged. The UN News article, published on March 1, 2025, discusses the destruction in Gaza after 16 months of conflict and mentions that UNDP started removing rubble from Gaza in December 2024. The UN article also includes a UN damage and needs assessment report from February 2025, which states that over 60% of homes and 65% of roads have been destroyed. The United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) released an updated assessment of the damage inflicted on buildings in the Gaza Strip, based on satellite imagery collected on February 29, 2024, revealing that 35% of all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been damaged.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates significant destruction in Gaza by December 2024. The Al-Monitor article states that nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged by December 1, 2024. The UN News article mentions that UNDP started removing rubble from Gaza in December 2024. The UNOSAT assessment from February 29, 2024, revealed that 35% of all buildings in the Gaza Strip have been damaged.

The claim that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024 is not entirely accurate. While the evidence confirms widespread destruction, it does not support the assertion that Gaza was "completely destroyed." The Al-Monitor article indicates that nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged, not 100%.

Therefore, the claim is partially inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts significant destruction in Gaza, which aligns with the evidence of widespread damage by December 2024. However, the claim that Gaza was "completely destroyed" is an overstatement, as the evidence indicates that nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged, not 100%. Therefore, the claim is misleading because it exaggerates the extent of the destruction. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts significant destruction in Gaza, which aligns with the evidence of widespread damage by December 2024, as reported by [Al-Monitor](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/01/gazas-destruction-numbers) and the [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160661). However, the claim that Gaza was "completely destroyed" is an overstatement, as the evidence indicates that nearly 69% of buildings were destroyed or damaged, not 100%.
