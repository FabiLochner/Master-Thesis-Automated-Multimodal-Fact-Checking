Content: The search result from syriadirect.org contains an image of Israeli military forces. <image:2103>

The claim '<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be fully verified. While there is evidence of Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
