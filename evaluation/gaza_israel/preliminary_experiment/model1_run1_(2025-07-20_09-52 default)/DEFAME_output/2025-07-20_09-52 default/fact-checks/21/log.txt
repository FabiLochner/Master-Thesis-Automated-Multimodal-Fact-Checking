The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there is evidence that Trump halted UNRWA funding, the provided sources do not confirm that he signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, as stated in the claim. Sources like [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100) and [The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-stops-us-involvement-with-un-rights-body-extends-unrwa-funding-halt/article69181701.ece) suggest the action occurred around February 2025, and a [Brookings article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/in-one-move-trump-eliminated-us-funding-for-unrwa-and-the-us-role-as-mideast-peacemaker/) from 2018 discusses a similar action.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
