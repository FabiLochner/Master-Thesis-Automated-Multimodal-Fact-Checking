Useful result: From [Source](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market): Found exact image on website with title: Anti-Semitism in France: How Fast Is the Tide Rising? | Vanity Fair

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html): Found exact image on website with title: Anti-Semitism Rises in Europe Amid Israel-Gaza Conflict
Content: The New York Times published an article titled "Anti-Semitism Rises in Europe Amid Israel-Gaza Conflict". The article discusses a rise in anti-Semitic incidents across Europe, including Germany and France, following the start of the Gaza conflict. The article mentions that more Jews have begun leaving France in recent months due to anti-Semitism. The article was published on August 2, 2014. <image:20>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The image depicts a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as confirmed by a reverse image search, which contradicts the claim that it shows a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory. The presence of a swastika in the image is also noted in multiple sources, including the New York Times and Vanity Fair ([https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html), [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
