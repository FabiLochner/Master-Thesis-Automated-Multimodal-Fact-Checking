Useful result: From [Source](https://hausatv.com/amurka-ta-kai-hare-hare-a-yankunan-kasa-yemen/): Found exact image on website with title: Amurka Ta Kai Hare-hare A Yankunan Kasa Yemen – HAUSATV
Content: The Hausa TV website published an article on April 11, 2025, reporting that U.S. warplanes carried out multiple attacks on various areas of Yemen, including the city of Sana'a. <image:5> is included in the article. The article states that the attacks were in response to Yemen's attacks on Israel.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While the U.S. did strike targets in Yemen on December 21, 2024, as reported by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-takes-down-drones-over-red-sea/), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific event. The image's source is Getty Images, credited to Anadolu, but the search results do not explicitly link the image to the U.S. strikes on December 22, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
