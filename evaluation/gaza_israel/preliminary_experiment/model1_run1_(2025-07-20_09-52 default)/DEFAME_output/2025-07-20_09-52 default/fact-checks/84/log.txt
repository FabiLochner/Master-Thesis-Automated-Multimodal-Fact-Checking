Useful result: From [Source](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7): Found exact image on website with title: MISSING CONTEXT: This image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ...
Content: The image is from 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.” <image:53>
The article was published on August 28, 2024, by PesaCheck.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/): Found exact image on website with title: Prime Minister's Residence - The Times of Israel
Content: The Times of Israel published an article about the Prime Minister's Residence. The article includes several images, including one of the Prime Minister's private residence in Caesarea. <image:53> is not included in the article. The article mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024.

The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024, as claimed. The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020, and the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
