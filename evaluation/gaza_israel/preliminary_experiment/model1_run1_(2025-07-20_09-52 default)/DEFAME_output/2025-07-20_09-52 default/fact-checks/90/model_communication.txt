Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

The first phase of the war, he [writes](https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1710796924092129517)
 on X, involves “destroying most of the enemy forces” that have infiltrated into Israel and have killed civilians and soldiers.

Israel has also begun an offensive into Gaza “and it will continue without hesitation and without respite – until the goals are achieved.”

“We will restore security to the citizens of Israel and we will win,” he writes.

A senior Biden administration official says on a call with reporters that the US “will treat Hamas for what they are. They are an international terrorist organization.”

Washington’s focus is currently on “ensuring that the Israelis have what they need to respond appropriately,” says the official.

The White House official says the US is ready “to offer all appropriate means of support to the people and government of Israel.”

“Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.”

“We remain deeply aligned,” said the official, adding that Israel’s response is likely to continue “for some time.

The official says that that US will continue to “work with parties throughout the region” to make sure the fighting doesn’t spread from Gaza.

The official also speaks about the potential of a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, saying that it is “premature to say the impact” that the war will have on those efforts.

“That process has a ways to travel,” says the official, adding that “terrorist groups like Hamas will not derail any such outcome.”

In a statement to Hamas’s Al-Aqsa TV, the terror group’s military spokesman Abu Ubaida claims that the number of hostages taken into Gaza is “many times greater than what Netanyahu thinks,” and that they are being held in various locations throughout the coastal strip.

The spokesman also urges Israel not to make “miscalculations,” adding that “whatever happens to the people of the Gaza Strip, will happen to \[the hostages\].”

Israel is now facing a deep crisis after witnessing the heroism of Hamas militants, Abu Ubaida says, adding that Israeli soldiers fell before them “like locusts.”

He vows that Hamas will continue the ongoing operation on all fronts.

He tells Channel 12 that the troops killed several terrorists and rescued his son and grandchildren.

His son, Amir, a journalist for Haaretz, posts on the social media platform X that his “heroic” father came from Tel Aviv, “led the troops” to the family’s home and “helped kill the terrorists.”

Amir also praises his daughters for staying quiet in the house for hours before they were rescued. “We are praying for the neighbors who are missing and injured.”

Eleven Nepalese agricultural students have been injured, two of them seriously, in the Hamas attack on southern Israel, according to a statement by the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Nepal’s ambassador to Israel tells CNN that when the attack began, the students were working on a farm in the area. They hid in a bomb shelter but that building was taken over by Hamas.

Separate unconfirmed reports in the Hindustani Times and India Today state that some Nepalese students are also among those who have been taken hostage by Hamas.

Germany and France move to reinforce security around Jewish temples, schools and monuments after the surprise attack by Hamas against Israel.

Germany tightens police protection of Jewish and Israeli institutions, as some supporters of the Palestinians took to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the attack.

France is focusing on Jewish temples and schools in cities across the country, as one Jewish leader expresses concern at the possibility the conflict might be imported there.

“In Berlin, police protection has been immediately stepped up,” Germany’s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser tells Bild newspaper. “The federal government and the regions are closely coordinating their actions.”

Germany’s authorities are also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere,” she adds.

In France, security had already been stepped up at synagogues in Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Strasbourg because of the holiday period being observed since late September.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin sends an urgent message to prefects running the country’s regions asking them to reinforce surveillance even further.

“At a time when terrorist attacks from Gaza are hitting Israel, I ask you to immediately step up vigilance, security and protection of Jewish community sites in France,” he writes in a message seen by AFP.

He called for a “visible and systematic static presence,” and the use of soldiers from France’s Operation Sentinelle, a special force deployed across the country since the 2015 terror attacks. The interior ministry will review the security situation at a special meeting tomorrow.

By [Gianluca Pacchiani](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/gianluca-pacchiani/ "Gianluca Pacchiani")

Hussam Badran, a member of the political bureau of Hamas, says the terror group’s onslaught is only in its early stages.

Badran says the attack, called the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” by the terror group, comes after careful preparation aimed at catching Israel by surprise.

The terror leader says this battle is different from all previous rounds of conflict, and calls on Arab mediators to convey to Israel that it must “leave our occupied lands.”

He adds that Hamas does not expect them to be mediators but rather supporters of its position.

Like a number of Hamas leaders who have issued statements today, Badran claims the attack is motivated by Israeli control over the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

The mosque, the third holiest site for Muslims, sits atop the Temple Mount, the holiest site for Jews as the location of the biblical temples. Israel has long maintained a delicate status quo at the site, in which Jews are allowed to visit during limited hours, but not pray. Terror groups have repeatedly used baseless claims of Israeli intentions to take over the mosque as a pretext for violence.

Badran also blames Israeli policies in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinian prisoners for the attack, adding that “we are the owners of this land, and this occupation will not last forever.”

The surprise onslaught against Israel has killed at least 250 Israelis, including many civilians, and injured over 1,000. An unspecified number of Israelis, living and dead, are held hostage by terrorists in Gaza.

Irish deputy premier and foreign affairs minister Micheal Martin condemns the attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens, and says it is “vital that the voice of moderation comes to the fore.”

Martin says he could “see tensions rising” during a recent trip to the region, and that the scale of today’s attack is “quite shocking.”

“We believe a two-state solution remains the only sensible and rational solution to this issue and it needs political momentum behind it,” he says.

“My sense is that the hardliners are growing in influence, and that’s why I believe the need to have moderate voices in the center is key,” he says.

“So what we need really is a political peace process to get on track in a serious way. That will mean I think, international intervention as well to facilitate that, but it’s a very, very complex and difficult situation and there will be many consequences to today’s attack.”

The decision applies to Israel’s magistrates, district and labor courts, as well as the Supreme Court and the rabbinical courts.

Hearings scheduled for parole committees on Sunday will be postponed to a later date.

The statement condemns “the recent unprovoked and continuous attacks by Israel on Palestinian towns, cities, and refugee camps” as well as “the inhumane siege imposed on the nearly 2 million inhabitants of Gaza,” which the organization says is “an implied declaration of open war on the Palestinians which oblige them to be in constant self-defense.”

The organization calls on the US government “to exert pressure on the occupation regime to immediately cease these atrocities” and criticizes any Arab and Muslim nations that have normalized relations with Israel.

According to the US State Department, Blinken calls “on all leadership in the region to condemn” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and also urges the PA to “enhance steps to restore calm and stability in the West Bank.”

Today in Ramallah, Abbas chaired an emergency leadership meeting of the Palestinian Authority, and according to the official news agency Wafa, “gave instructions to provide protection for the Palestinian people, stressing the right of the Palestinian people to defend themselves against the terrorism of settlers and the occupation forces.”

Abbas also “gave directions to provide all that is necessary to bolster the resilience and steadfastness of the Palestinian people in facing the crimes committed by the Israeli occupation and settler gangs.”

Netanyahu says the army is currently clearing Hamas terrorists from everywhere they infiltrated, going house to house, “restoring control to our hands.”

He sends love and condolences to all the bereaved families that lost loved ones “brutally murdered in cold blood.” He prays for the recovery of the injured.

And he warns Hamas that Israel will hold it responsible for the hostages it has taken. “Israel will avenge anyone who is harmed,” he says, “in so much as a hair on their head.”

He says Israel stands in solidarity with residents of the south, who stood firm and fought bravely.

He praises the security forces, calling them the latest in the long history of Israel’s war heroes.

“You are fighting now for all of our homes, for all of our futures,” he says.

“We are all with you, we all love you, we all salute you.”

He praises the members of the emergency services, and says their spirit will help overcome our enemies.

He says he spoke with President Biden and other world leaders from France, Britain and beyond, thanks Biden for his “unreserved support,” and says he secured international backing for “freedom of action” for Israel.

Netanyahu says all Israelis “are in this together. It will take time. It will be hard. We have challenging days ahead of us.”

But he promises that “with God’s help, with our combined strength, and with our belief in an eternal Israel, we will win.”

In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vows to use “all the power” of the IDF to destroy Hamas’s capabilities, and tells Gaza’s residents to “get out now.”

Calling today’s events something “never before seen in Israel,” he vows to ensure “it will never happen again.”

He begins by saying Hamas “invaded Israeli territory this morning,” and started a “cruel and evil war,” targeting innocent civilians young and old.

“We will win this war, but the price will be unbearably heavy,” he says.

“Hamas wants to murder us all,” Netanyahu says, “murdering children and mothers in their homes, in their beds.

“It is an enemy that kidnaps elderly people, children, young girls,” an enemy “that massacres and slaughters our civilians, our children, who simply wanted to enjoy the festival.”

“What happened today has never been seen before in Israel and I will ensure it never happens again. The entire government supports this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its power to destroy Hamas’s capabilities,” he says. “We will fight them to the bitter end and avenge this black day they plotted for Israel and its people.”

Israel will target Hamas everywhere — turning the places it “hides and operates” into “cities of ruin.”

He tells the “residents of Gaza” to “get out now because we will operate everywhere and with full force.”

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 250, Hebrew-language media reports say, citing medical officials.

The toll is expected to continue to rise.

At least 1,450 have been wounded, many seriously.

Dozens of civilians as well as IDF soldiers are believed to have been abducted and brought into Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

US President Joe Biden backs Israel’s right to self defense, warns other parties in the region against joining the attack against the Jewish state, and says he is in contact with leaders around the region.

“Today the people of Israel are under attack orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas. In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere, the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back, we’ll make sure that they’ll have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves,” Biden says in a broadcast, while flanked by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“The world has seen appalling images of thousands of rockets in a space of hours raining down on Israeli cities… Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel, killing not only Israeli soldiers but Israeli civilians in the streets, in their homes, innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas, just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It’s unconscionable.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop. There’s never justification for terrorist attacks and my administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

“This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.”

“It’s also a terrible tragedy on a human level, hurting innocent people, seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It’s heartbreaking.”

Biden says he has spoken to the king of Jordan and members of Congress, and told his national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts for military, diplomatic and intelligence cooperation to “make sure Israel has what it needs.”

Biden has directed his team to be in constant contact with leaders around the region, including in Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian Authority, Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Oman, the UAE and Europe.

He says he will remain in close contact with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he spoke to earlier today.

“Let there be no mistake, the United States stands with the State of Israel,” Biden says.

Magen David Adom names the senior paramedic and ambulance driver who was killed this morning as Aharon Haimov.

He died after being shot in an MDA ambulance by Palestinian terrorists as he was on his way to treat victims in his hometown of Ofakim as the coordinated attack on Israel by Hamas from Gaza unfolded.

Haimov was a 25-year-old married father of two. He also leaves behind parents, siblings and an extended family.

Haimov began his career with MDA as a post-high school volunteer. He later joined the organization in a professional capacity as an emergency medicine paramedic and ambulance driver.

In a statement, MDA says that Haimov always performed his duties in an exemplary way and was the first to respond to emergency events.

“He was a person who put the good of others and the value of life ahead of everything else — including today, on this tragic morning,” says MDA director-general Eli Bin.

By [Luke Tress](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/luke-tress/ "Luke Tress")

The UN Human Rights Council official tasked with investigating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict refrains from condemning Palestinian terrorists after they launch a devastating surprise attack on Israeli civilians and soldiers.

UN special rapporteur for the Palestinians Francesca Albanese says, “I unequivocally condemn attacks on civilians. Whoever launches them.”

“Today’s violence must be put into context. Almost six decades of hostile military rule over an entire civilian population… are in themselves an aggression,” Albanese says. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005.

Albanese has a history of antisemitism and tends to place sole blame for the conflict on Israel, which she views as a “colonial” entity.

The US, Israel and other authorities have demanded her removal due to her bias, but the UN has not taken any action against her.

Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, also hedges in his condemnation of terror.

“I am extremely alarmed by the rapidly escalating events in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. The number of civilian casualties on both sides is reportedly already in the hundreds,” he says. “Violence is never the answer. I appeal to all sides to stop the fighting immediately and protect civilians everywhere and at all times.”

The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, condemns the terror attacks.

“I am shocked and appalled at reports this morning that hundreds, possibly thousands, of indiscriminate rockets have been fired by Palestinian armed groups towards Israel, and that at least 22 Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured,” Türk says.

More recent figures indicate at least 200 Israelis have been killed, over 1,400 wounded, and others taken hostage.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tor Wennesland, the UN’s special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, both issue condemnations of the terror attacks.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, hasn’t been heard from since 8:11 a.m. this morning, when he sent two messages to his parents: “I love you” and “I’m sorry.”

At the time, Goldberg-Polin’s parents, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, didn’t understand the cryptic meaning of the message.

They’d last seen Hersh at 11 p.m. the previous night, after he attended Simhat Torah holiday services with them at their local Jerusalem synagogue and then joined them for dinner with family friends.

“He had a backpack and left at around 11 to join his friend,” said Polin, who didn’t know anything specific about his son’s plans.

The family is religiously observant and doesn’t usually use phones on Shabbat, but after Polin came home early from synagogue Saturday morning, the two reached out to a good friend of their son’s who confirmed that Goldberg-Polin was at an all-night “nature party” near Kibbutz Re’im.

The community is close to the Gaza Strip, in an area where Hamas terrorists attacked civilians, including at the party.

Within several hours, photos of handwritten lists began circulating on social media with the names of party attendees and the locations where some had escaped to, Polin says.

“One list said Yishuv Saad, and his name was on that list, and then it was on the Ofakim list,” Polin says. “But he wasn’t at any of those places.”

Friends were at the couple’s home all day, calling and checking with people they knew in each location, but Goldberg-Polin and his friend haven’t been found anywhere. They called hospitals in the south, including Soroka and Barzilay, without any success.

The Jerusalem police are involved, Polin says, and are taking responsibility for reporting the two missing young men to all police units. Pictures of Polin-Goldberg and his friend are also being circulated on social media.

“They think there’s still a bunch of people hiding in the area,” Polin says, adding that the mother of his son’s friend is inclined to drive down south to look for them, but he advises against it, having heard that roads are closed. “Every time we hear information, we turn over everything we can to find out anything. There’s very little we can actually do.”

The Israel Defense Forces says it struck another two high-rise towers in the Gaza Strip, used by Hamas.

The “Palestine” building was used by a number of Hamas units, including intelligence, weapon production, and offices of senior members, the IDF says.

Another office building served as the headquarters of Hamas’s general security, the IDF says.

Earlier today, the IDF hit two other multistory buildings in the Gaza Strip that the military says housed Hamas assets.

Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri (YouTube screenshot)

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of Hamas, calls the terror group’s onslaught against Israel an “open battle” aimed at achieving the liberation of the Palestinian people and their holy places, following the perceived “desecration” of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem — known as the Al-Aqsa compound to Muslims — by Jewish worshipers over the holiday of Sukkot.

Al-Arouri alleges plans by Israel to impose an unspecified “new reality” at the flashpoint site after the holiday. Hamas has repeatedly accused Israel of seeking to alter the sensitive status quo at the holy site as a pretext for violence.

Al-Arouri adds that Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails are “about to be freed,” anticipating the liberation of security prisoners in exchange for dozens of Israeli hostages the group has reportedly taken, including both civilians and soldiers.

Al-Arouri says some of the Israeli hostages are “senior officers.” He falsely says Hamas does not kill or harm civilians, claiming that there are videos showing how the terror group treats civilians “humanely.” Hamas terrorists slaughtered civilians in southern Israel today, took others captive, and fired hundreds of rockets at civilian population centers.

“We have a plan for all stages of this conflict,” al-Arouri says, “both in case of an Israeli request for a ceasefire, and in case of a continuing escalation of the violence. We are prepared for all options.” He adds that an Israeli ground invasion would be the “best scenario” for Hamas.

Al-Arouri also expresses his “hope and trust” that Palestinians outside Gaza will join the fight “to defend Al-Aqsa,” especially terror groups in the West Bank. Al-Arouri is considered the de facto leader of Hamas in the West Bank.

“We entered this battle not just for a few hours. We entered it knowing that there will be consequences, and we have no choice but to fight it to achieve our high goals,” he says.

He adds that Hamas is in communication with international and regional parties, and implies that it has received offers for mediation. He also accuses the US of providing financial and military aid to Ukraine but neglecting Palestinians.

Al-Arouri touches on the possible participation of Hezbollah in the attack on Israel, saying Israel is right to fear violence on the Lebanese front in the north, claiming that Israel occupies part of Lebanon’s territory.

Yair Lapid (L), Benny Gantz (C) and Benjamin Netanyahu (R) (Flash90)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proposes that opposition parties Yesh Atid and National Unity enter an emergency government following Hamas’s devastating surprise attack Saturday morning.

Netanyahu makes the offer during a meeting with Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid and National Unity party leader Benny Gantz held earlier today, saying such a government would be the same in format as the Levi Eshkol government then-opposition leader Menachem Begin joined before the Six Day War in 1967.

Gantz says he is considering entering such a government for the duration of the war but insists that government would “deal with security challenges alone” and in a manner that would allow “substantive partnership and influence over decision-making in relevant forums” for his party.

The National Unity party leader tells Netanyahu that regardless, the current government will receive full backing “for any responsible and determined security action.”

Lapid said earlier this evening that he would join “a reduced, professional, emergency government” and says it would be impossible to manage a war with “the extreme and dysfunctional composition of the current cabinet,” essentially calling on the prime minister to remove the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties from the government in order for him to bring his Yesh Atid party into the coalition.

The death toll from the Hamas terror group’s massive attack on Israel rises to more than 200, Hebrew-language media reports say.

The toll is expected to rise higher.

At least 1,100 have been wounded, many seriously.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points and overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Thousands of rockets have been fired at the south and center of the country, killing a number of people.

The Hamas rocket barrage on central Israel a short while ago has wounded at least nine civilians, medics say.

The Magen David Adom ambulance service said in Rishon Lezion, medics treated two men aged 28 who were seriously hurt.

In Yavne, a 73-year-old woman was seriously hurt and a 77-year-old man was lightly hurt, MDA says.

In Bat Yam, a 24-year-old man was moderately hurt, MDA says.

In Tel Aviv, four people were wounded, including one in moderate condition, MDA adds.

The victims are being taken to hospitals in the area.

Hamas claimed to have launched 150 rockets from the Gaza Strip at Tel Aviv in the barrage.

A coalition of organizations behind the anti-judicial overhaul protests announce a general aid effort for residents of Israeli communities near the Gaza border, including hosting for citizens fleeing the fighting, transportation services, equipment logistics, assistance from mental health professionals, and more.

“At this difficult hour for our brothers and sisters in the south and the entire Jewish nation, the protest organizations are putting their complete organizational infrastructure and logistical capabilities toward the aid and support of the residents in the line of fire,” the organizations say in a social media notice.

The organizations also call for a freeze on all protest activities until further notice and said that while the “gigantic failure” of the security establishment in regards to the surprise Hamas attack must be addressed, “at this time all efforts must be directed toward aid of the southern residents, IDF soldiers and security forces.”

The White House slams a Republican “disinformation” campaign blaming the Biden administration for today’s Hamas attack on Israel.

Prominent Republican lawmakers as well as former president Donald Trump have claimed the US deal to release hostages from Iran gave Tehran access to funds that it is using to support Hamas.

“Not a single cent from these funds has been spent, and when it is spent, it can only be spent on things like food and medicine for the Iranian people,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“These funds have absolutely nothing to do with the horrific attacks today and this is not the time to spread disinformation,” she adds.

Hundreds of Hamas gunmen infiltrated into Israel this morning, crossing at multiple points, overwhelming what the IDF considered to be the highly sophisticated border fence.

Thirteen hours after the start of the attacks, there are reported to still be 22 “active” areas in southern Israel, where gunmen are still active or feared to be in the field.

Hamas claims to have abducted dozens of Israelis to Gaza; the IDF has confirmed that soldiers and civilians have been taken hostage, but has not specified a number.

Energy Minister Israel Katz signs an order instructing the Israel Electric Corporation to cut the supply of electricity to Gaza.

“It’s not going to be how it was,” Katz says in a statement.

Gaza largely relies on Israel and fuel imports for its power.

Turkey’s Foreign Ministry declines to condemn Hamas or say the word “terrorism,” saying only that they “are deeply concerned about the violence and tension occurred \[sic\] in Israel and Palestine today.”

“We attach high importance to the restoration of calm in the region as soon as possible, and strongly condemn the loss of civilian lives. We underline that acts of violence and associated escalations will not benefit anyone, and call on the parties to act with restraint and avoid impulsive steps.”

Ankara also urges “the parties” to work toward a two-state solution.

Magen David Adom thanks the Israeli public for its huge response to the call for blood donations for treating war victims at Israel’s hospitals. Thousands of units of blood were donated at the many MDA donation sites around the country.

As of 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, MDA says it has enough blood supply for the time being and has asked people to hold off on donating until tomorrow or later in the week.

At Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv alone, 650 individuals showed up to donate blood. Overwhelmed by the turnout, Ichilov announced that it had closed its blood donation station until further notice.

The Israel Defense Forces has regained control of the Re’im military base in southern Israel, which houses the Gaza Division, from Hamas terrorists, according to Hebrew-language media reports.

Earlier, the IDF said it was fighting Hamas terrorists at 22 different locations in southern Israel.

The military has been sweeping the towns where the terrorists infiltrated, reaching civilians who have been holed up for more than 12 hours.

Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan sends a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Sérgio França Danese, the Brazilian diplomat who holds the Security Council presidency this month, calling on the Security Council to immediately condemn Hamas.

“It is now time for the international community including the Security Council to unequivocally condemn the appalling terror attacks carried out by Hamas and all terrorist organizations against the civilians of Israel,” Erdan writes.

“Israel expects and demands the solidarity and support of all those in the international community who oppose this barbaric terrorism and the targeting of innocent men, women and children for slaughter. It will not tolerate moral equivalence between those defending against this terrorism and those perpetrating it. There can be no option other than zero tolerance for Hamas’ war crimes and genocidal agenda.”

Erdan also places blame on Iran for, in his words, funding and directing Hamas.

“The State of Israel will act in any way necessary to protect its citizens and sovereignty from the ongoing terrorist attacks originating from the Gaza Strip and carried out by Hamas and other terrorist organizations,” he writes. “We will not stand idly by as Israelis are attacked and killed.”

The Israel Defense Forces claims to have killed hundreds of Palestinian terrorists in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip in the last few hours.

Among the counter-attacks is a drone strike against two terrorists attempting to breach the security barrier near the disused Karni crossing; nine terrorists killed during clashes with troops in the town of Nirim; and four terrorists targeted by a fighter jet at the Erez Crossing.

Other terror squads were killed by troops in the southern towns of Sufa, Kfar Aza, and Kerem Shalom, the IDF says.

The IDF also carried out several drone strikes against terrorists in the area.

The military publishes footage showing one of the strikes near the southern town of Be’eri.

Four terrorists are still holding two Israelis hostage in an apartment in Ofakim, some 12 miles (20 kilometers) from the Gaza border.

The incident has been playing out all day, since several carloads of terrorists drove into the city, Channel 12 reports.

When rocket alarms sounded, and residents of the city descended into bomb shelters, the gunmen opened fire on them, killing several people. Many terrorists have been killed in the hours since.

Four terrorists went up into an apartment in the city, where two Israelis remained, and they have been holding them hostage ever since.

Security forces have made several attempts to find a way to break in and rescue them, but to no avail thus far.

Magen David Adom’s Shai Kadosh says two people he knows were killed in the city during the day and that he and his colleagues have been treating casualties all day.

In light of the high number of injuries due to the war, the Health Ministry announces that all ambulatory and elective medical services will be canceled on Sunday at hospitals within 80 km of the Gaza border. Well-baby clinics will also be closed within that area.

Some hospitals in the center of the country, including Hadassah in Jerusalem and Meir in Kfar Saba, have also announced that they will only accept patients in need of urgent medical care.

Hospitals throughout the country will continue to provide critical and timely care, such as oncological and hematological treatments, dialysis, in vitro fertilization treatment, and emergency cardiological procedures.

If patients are scheduled for a hospital procedure or clinic visit on Monday, they should double-check with the hospital whether they should come in or not.

The Meuhedet health maintenance organization has asked its members to seek service from their primary physicians via hybrid (online) medicine appointments as much as possible.

All medical system employees have been ordered to cancel plans to travel outside the country, and all medical staff currently outside Israel have been asked to return.

The European Union “condemns in the strongest possible terms” the Hamas attacks on Israel, and stressed Israel’s right to self defense.

“The EU calls for an immediate cessation of these senseless attacks and violence,” says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in a statement issued on behalf of all 27 member states, “which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people’s aspirations for peace.”

Borrell says the EU “stands in solidarity with Israel which has the right to defend itself in line with international law, in the face of such violent and indiscriminate attacks.”

A man says his wife, two young children and mother-in-law have been taken to Gaza and that he has seen them in a video from the coastal enclave.

Yoni Asher tells Channel 12 news that his wife and children aged three and five were visiting his mother-in-law at Kibbutz Nir Oz near the Gaza border when they were taken during an infiltration by Hamas terrorists.

Earlier this afternoon, he told the outlet that he had not spoken to his family for a number of hours but that he had tracked his wife’s phone to the Gaza Strip.

Asher issued desperate pleas for help in finding his family, speaking to multiple outlets in the hope that he could get the message out.

“I have seen my wife’s phone in \[Gaza city\] Khan Yunis,” he told the Kan public broadcaster. “I contacted the police, the Home Front Command and I don’t know what’s going on. I need your help so that I can contact my wife, my daughters and my mother-in-law.”

The activists from the anti-overhaul protest movement leverage their network of thousands of Israelis and US Jews in the US to respond to the Palestinian terror onslaught in Israel.

The funds will go to medical, psychological and physical support for the victims, [the campaign](https://www.americaisraeldemocracy.org/southunderattack)
 says.

“We join hands to support the needs of Israelis under attack. This is what we can do from here now,” organizers say. “This is exactly the same solidarity from which we stand in rallies every week.”

All protest activities are suspended.

With some flights to Israel canceled, the activists are also organizing local hosts who can house Israelis who are unable to return home.

Activists from the UnXeptable protest group urge Israelis who are in the US and need assistance to contact them.

An open support gathering will take place at the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan at 76th Street and Amsterdam Ave. between 2-4 p.m. this afternoon.

“The Hamas terrorist organization deliberately places its military assets in the heart of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip,” the IDF says.

“Prior to the strike, the IDF provided advance warning to the occupants of the building and asked them to evacuate,” the military adds.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid calls for an “emergency government” to manage “the difficult and complex operation ahead of us” after more than 100 Israelis have been killed, close to 1,000 wounded and an unknown number of soldiers and civilians abducted by Hamas terrorists into Gaza.

“The State of Israel is at war. It won’t be easy and it won’t be short. It has strategic consequences which we haven’t seen for many years. There is a serious risk that it will become a multi-front war,” Lapid says in an announcement.

“A short while ago, I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I told him that in this emergency situation I’m willing to put aside our differences and form an emergency, narrow, professional government with him to manage the difficult and complex operation ahead of us.”

Netanyahu, he says, “knows that with the current extreme and dysfunctional security cabinet, he can’t manage a war. Israel needs to be led by a professional, experienced, and responsible government. I have no doubt that former Defense Minister \[Benny\] Gantz would also join a government like this.”

“Forming an emergency professional government will make clear to our enemies that the vast majority of Israeli citizens stand behind the IDF and security forces. It will make clear to the world, in the international community, that the people of Israel stand united against this threat,” says Lapid.

“The State of Israel suffered a hard blow today. We are all hurting, we are all angry. However, wars and countries aren’t managed with pain and anger but with calm and a strategic understanding of the situation. We need to put politics to one side for the sake of an emergency government that will manage this situation with determination and won’t deal with anything else until we achieve victory over our enemies.”

Lapid made his offer for an emergency government in person to Netanyahu after receiving a security update, says a source close to the opposition leader.

The source says that “the offer is real, this isn’t a political thing. The offer is there.”

Netanyahu has not responded and a source close to Lapid declines to comment if fellow opposition party head, National Unity leader Gantz, was consulted before or after the unity government offer was made.

Gallant says Israel is currently at war, and has been facing terror attacks against its citizens since this morning – this includes men, women, children and elderly individuals.

“The State of Israel will win this war, and Hamas will be held responsible for its actions,” his office says.

Gallant thanks Austin and the US Administration for their support for Israel.

US President Joe Biden says he told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on their phone call earlier today, “we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and people of Israel.”

“Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering,” Biden says in a statement condemning this morning’s surprise Hamas attack on southern and central Israel.

“Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who have been wounded,” he adds.

“My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Biden says.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned Hamas’s surprise attack on southern and central Israel this morning.

“The secretary-general is appalled by reports that civilians have been attacked and abducted from their own homes,” says a statement from his spokesperson.

Guterres “is deeply concerned for the civilian population and urges maximum restraint. Civilians must be respected and protected in accordance with international humanitarian law at all times.”

“The secretary-general urges all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration,” the statement continues. “He stresses that violence cannot provide a solution to the conflict, and that only through negotiation leading to a two-state solution can peace be achieved.”

Now that the IDF has confirmed that Israeli civilians and soldiers have been kidnapped and taken as hostages to Gaza, Israeli television is showing heavily pixelated clips that have been running for hours on social media.

The clips appear to show Israelis being abducted on foot and in vehicles, and were apparently filmed inside Israel and inside Gaza.

Many of the clips are too gruesome to broadcast.

By [Amanda Borschel-Dan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/writers/amanda-borschel-dan/ "Amanda Borschel-Dan")

Middle East analyst Avi Issacharoff tells The Times of Israel on Saturday that the unprecedented assault on Israel by land, sea and air is an inadvertent benchmark for the Israel-Hamas relations, as significant as the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US.

“I think that they wanted to kidnap a few people, to negotiate over them, and not to get into the threat of their collapse — of their ending” — that this coordinated attack will inevitably bring, Issacharoff says. “Everyone knows that Gaza will pay a very heavy price.”

Any former policies of cooperation with the Gaza-based terrorist organization are “not even relevant anymore,” he says, and negotiations “under or over the table” will no longer take place.

Asked whether he believes Israel’s northern border will become another front in the current war, he says it is as yet unclear whether Hezbollah is planning a coordinated attack.

“Either they’re going to jump in and be very stupid, or not,” he says.

“Starting another front with Israel may bring more \[Israeli\] casualties… but at the end of the day, we might end up with the end of Hamas and Hezbollah.”

“It’s the 9/11 \[for Israel\], and if this doesn’t go into a major ground operation, it’s the end of this government’s political life,” says Issacharoff.

The Israel Defense Forces’ top spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, confirms the Hamas terror group has taken Israelis as hostages to the Gaza Strip.

In a briefing with reporters, Hagari says Israeli soldiers have also been killed in the fighting.

No numbers are given on the number of hostages or soldiers killed.

Hagari says there are still 22 locations of ongoing fighting in southern Israel, including hostage situations in Be’eri and Ofakim.

He says Israeli troops have reached all towns on the Gaza border, and are working to scan each and every one.

Four divisions are being deployed to the Gaza border, joining 31 battalions that are already there, Hagari says.

Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition National Unity party, pledges support for the security and emergency forces and says Israel is “completely unified.”

“I want to say clearly, in a way that resonates from Gaza, via Beirut, to Tehran: The entire people of Israel are united,” he says. “All Israel’s citizens stand behind the security forces, and the government has the backing to charge a heavy, painful and effective price in order that an event like this is not repeated.”

“There is no coalition and opposition now,” Gantz adds, “just a single fist that will pound the enemy.”

He says all those involved in this attack are destined to die, and that any other terror groups that decide to take part “will be making a terrible mistake.”

“It must be honestly said: the results of this attack are grave. Soon, some of the rumors will be confirmed as bad and painful news for us all. I send my condolences to the families of the fallen… and pray for the recovery of all the injured.”

He hails the bravery of civilians, the emergency services and soldiers. “Israel can be taken by surprise, but it cannot be beaten, as we will prove this time as well,” Gantz says.

Ra’am’s Mansour Abbas urges Arab Israelis not to respond to rumors or incitement

Abbas, leader of the Islamist Ra’am party, is the first Arab Israeli political leader to publish a statement reacting to the ongoing deadly Hamas assault on Israel.

The party leader writes in Hebrew: “In light of the sad, tragic events since this morning, and the situation assessments saying that the situation may devolve into a regional war, I call on Arab citizens of Israel and on all citizens, Arabs and Jews alike, to exert restraint and behave responsibly and patiently, to obey the law and maintain public order.”

“I urge \[Arab Israeli citizens\] to restrain from any type of violence or damage to public or private property, and not respond to rumors or incitement aimed at causing an escalation inside or outside Arab towns, or in mixed cities.”

Abbas further calls for unity and mutual support and to give hospitality to families fleeing the areas under attack, particularly in the Negev and in unrecognized villages, many of which are not equipped with anti-rocket shelters.

Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be’eri, tells Channel 12 that she is in a safe room at her home in the kibbutz and is hearing “lots of gunfire” nearby.

She speaks amid unconfirmed reports that Hamas gunmen are holding hostages at the kibbutz dining hall.

Meanwhile, another resident of the south says his wife and daughters have disappeared, and that he has traced his wife’s phone — which doesn’t answer — to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. He says he fears his family has been kidnapped to Gaza.

Hamas claims to have kidnapped dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers to Gaza.

These reports are not officially confirmed by Israel. Channel 12 news reports, however, that Hamas has kidnapped men and women, young and old, civilians and soldiers to the Gaza Strip. The infiltration is proving “far more successful” from Hamas’s perspective than it would have expected, the TV station’s Ohad Hemo says, and Hamas almost certainly doesn’t know itself how many Israelis it has kidnapped.

In turn, though, Hemo says, the Israeli response in Gaza is likely to be much more far-reaching than Hamas would have expected.

A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expresses support for an attack Hamas launched against Israel, calling it a “proud operation.”

“We support the proud operation of Al-Aqsa Flood,” Yahya Rahim Safavi says at a meeting held in support of Palestinian children in Tehran, quoted by ISNA news agency.

“We support this operation, and we are sure that the resistance front also supports this issue,” says Safavi, who is a senior general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Safavi expressed backing for the Palestinian terrorists “until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.”

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani also hailed the Palestinian terror assault on Israel.

“Today’s operation marked a new page in the field of resistance and armed operations against the occupiers,” he says.

“The resistance has so far achieved brilliant victories during this operation, and this is a bright spot in the history of the Palestinian people’s struggle against the Zionists.”

At a parliament session on Saturday, Iranian lawmakers chanted “Down with Israel,” “Down with America,” and “Welcome Palestine,” according to a video published by Tasnim news agency.

Iran, which hosted leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in June, considers Israel its arch-enemy.

German airline Lufthansa is cutting flights to Israel following a wave of Palestinian attacks, a spokesman tells AFP.

“Given the current security situation in Tel Aviv,” Lufthansa will maintain a single flight to Frankfurt but “all other Lufthansa flights to and from Tel Aviv have been canceled for this Saturday.”

The Walla news site says Swiss Air, Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines are among the companies to cancel flights to and from Israel.

Over nine hours since the Hamas terror group launched a deadly assault on Israel with terrorists infiltrating from land, air and sea, there are still gunmen in a number of Israeli communities.

In addition, there is still near-continuous rocket fire — while the center of the country was targeted by projectiles earlier in the day, the fire is now mainly toward southern towns.

Saudi Arabia calls for an “immediate halt to the escalation between the two sides, the protection of civilians, and restraint” amid the ongoing assault by the Hamas terror group.

Riyadh says it ‘repeatedly warned’ of an explosive situation with Palestinians.

In a statement, the Kingdom recalls its “repeated warnings of the danger of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry further calls on the international community to lead a “credible peace process” to achieve a two-state solution.

The kingdom has been conducting negotiations to achieve a normalization deal with Israel. According to recent leaks, the Saudi negotiators, while insisting on concessions for the Palestinians, do not see the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for a possible deal.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden are expected to speak in the next hour amid a massive and deadly attack by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded as terrorists infiltrated from Gaza into Israeli towns, and thousands of rockets were launched at the south and center of the country.

President Isaac Herzog calls for the international community to unite in its condemnation of Hamas after the Gaza-based terror group launched a deadly attack.

“Today we saw the true face of Hamas. A terrorist army whose only goal is the cold-blooded murder of innocent men, women, and children. Supported and directed by their proxy commanders in Iran, they carried out an unprovoked, heinous attack against the Jewish state on a Jewish holy day. Innocent civilians were massacred and wounded, and many are still under attack,” Herzog says in a statement.

“The State of Israel will take all measures necessary to eliminate this clear and immediate danger to our citizens. Israel will overcome in the face of all challenges,” he says.

“I call upon the family of nations – this war waged against us marks a line in the sand. Now is the time to hear clear, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas, its allies, and its backers in Iran. Now is the time to stand firm with Israel in support of its just and moral battle in the face of an abhorrent enemy,” he says.

“There are Hamas troops walking around. We see videos of them. They’re walking round with impunity,” she tells the Kan public broadcaster from the bomb shelter of her home.

Security forces are fighting terrorists in at least four areas in the town, the broadcaster reports.

“We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to alarms, we thought it was the usual rocket attacks but we started hearing gunshots on the street, sounded like it came from the parking of our building. Then we realized something was unusual. We then started seeing Hamas people in pickup trucks. They knocked on the homes of residents, who thought they were Israeli soldiers. They took them hostage,” says Kahlon.

The United States “unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” says White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson.

“There is never any justification for terrorism. We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks,” Watson says.

The kibbutz is one of several places where Hamas gunmen are still believed to be on the loose.

Steinman, speaking a few minutes later, also says several of his friends and contacts who live in areas close to the Gaza border, including some he was talking to earlier today, “are no longer answering… and it’s clear why they’re not answering.”

“These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland says in a statement.

“I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians.”

“This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink,” he adds.

The mayor of Sderot, Alon Davidi, says his city is still under attack.

“Don’t open the doors, stay inside, close the windows… we’re still searching the area,” he tells local residents via Channel 12.

He says the Hamas leadership, from Ismael Haniyeh on down, are “animals” who “must be harmed and killed.”

The people of Israel “haven’t yet seen” what’s happened in the city, he says — “inhuman acts” against innocent people. The terrorists have to be “wiped out,” he says.

Israel has given Gazans food, water and electricity, and allowed Gazans into work, he notes, but the Gaza Hamas leadership are “murderers who must be buried under the ground. Not because we are cruel, but because those who are merciful to the cruel, ultimately are cruel to the good.”

“People still don’t understand the numbers” and the extent of the attacks, he says.

A Channel 12 reporter in the city says there are many “bodies on the ground… terribly grave pictures, scenes that are hard to describe.”

These fatalities, the reporter stresses, are victims of gunfire by Hamas terrorists who infiltrated from Gaza into the city, not rocket attacks.

At least 40 people have been killed and over 700 injured since the start of the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, the Magen David Adom emergency service says.

The Health Ministry says 779 people have been hospitalized.

Terror cells from the Gaza group have infiltrated a number of communities in the south of the country.

In addition, thousands of rockets have been fired at the center and south.

Hamas has claimed to have taken a number of hostages from Israel to the Gaza Strip. There has been no confirmation from Israel.

The assault has been ongoing since approximately 6:30 a.m.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a statement at the start of the security cabinet meeting, calling for all the citizens of the country to unite.

“Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first goal is first of all to cleanse the area of the enemy forces that have infiltrated, and restore security and peace to the settlements that were attacked,” Netanyahu says.

“The second goal, at the same time, is to exact a huge price from the enemy, also in the Gaza Strip,” he says.

“The third goal is to fortify other arenas so that no one makes the mistake of joining this war,” Netanyahu says.

“We are at war, in war, you have to keep calm. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war,” the premier says.

The official name for the campaign by the Israel Defense Forces amid the devastating Hamas attack is Operation Swords of Iron.

Ukraine’s President writes a long post condemning the devastating Hamas terror assault on Israel and says that all its details should be revealed to the world.

Here is the post in full:

“Horrible news from Israel. My condolences go out to everyone who lost relatives or close ones in the terrorist attack. We have faith that order will be restored and terrorists will be defeated.

“Terror should have no place in the world, because it is always a crime, not just against a specific country or this terror’s victims, but against humanity in general and our entire world.

“Anyone who resorts to terror commits a crime against the world. Whoever finances terror is committing a crime against the world. The world must stand united and in solidarity so that terror does not attempt to break or subjugate life anywhere and at any moment.

“Israel’s right to self-defense is unquestionable.

“All details surrounding this terrorist assault must be revealed so that the world knows and holds accountable everyone who supported and helped carry out the attack.

“All Ukrainian citizens who remain in the risk zone must carefully obey all orders issued by local security services and remain vigilant. Please be cautious. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Israel are ready to assist in any situation.

“To support Ukrainians in Israel, we established an operational headquarters. If you require assistance, please contact any of our diplomatic or consular offices in any convenient and accessible manner.

Every life is valuable! We condemn all forms of terrorism.”

Channel 12 broadcasts footage from earlier this morning apparently showing a bulldozer breaking through the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Dozens of terrorists from the Hamas terrorist group infiltrated into Israel by land, air and sea, going on deadly rampages through border communities.

The Hamas terror group has published footage showing its members capturing a number of Israeli soldiers during an attack on a military base on the border with the Gaza Strip this morning.

Other clips circulated online have purported to show Israeli civilians taken hostage by the terror group.

The IDF has yet to comment on the allegations.

“This is against international law,” he writes. “Hostages must be released immediately.”

European leaders roundly condemn the massive assault by the Hamas terror group on Israel.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says Hamas contributes to “the intensification of violence,” adding Israel “has our full solidarity” and “the right, guaranteed by international law, to defend itself against terrorism.”

France expresses “full solidarity with Israel and the victims” and underscored “its absolute rejection of terrorism and its commitment to Israel’s security.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he “firmly condemns” the attacks.

Italy also backed “Israel’s right to defend itself” against the “brutal attack.”

Britain’s foreign minister James Cleverly condemns the “horrific attacks” and underlined Israel’s right to self-defense.

Dutch PM Mark Rutte says: “Appalling images from Israel. Terror organization Hamas is waging an unprecedented attack on Israel… This violence must stop; Israel has every right to defend itself.”

Spain says it is “shocked by the indiscriminate violence” of the attacks on Israel while Ukraine and the Czech Republic say they back Israel’s right to defend itself.

The European Union “unequivocally” condemns attacks by the Palestinian group Hamas on Israel and called for an immediate stop to the violence.

The comments came after a barrage of rockets was fired and fighters from the Palestinian enclave infiltrated Israel, a major escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says she “unequivocally” condemns the “terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel,” adding that it was “terrorism in its most contemptible form.”

“Israel has the right to defend itself against such odious attack,” she adds.

“This horrific violence must stop immediately. Terrorism and violence solve nothing. The EU expresses its solidarity with Israel in these difficult moments,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says.

European Council president Charles Michel also condemns the “indiscriminate attacks launched against Israel and its people this morning inflicting terror and violence against innocent citizens.”

“My thoughts are with all the victims. EU stands in solidarity with Israeli people in this horrific moment.”

The Israel Defense Forces announces it is canceling schools in central and southern Israel, meaning roughly 1 million children will stay home tomorrow, amid ongoing fighting between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip.

All schools south of Netanya and north of the central Negev are to be closed and businesses can only be opened if there is ready access to bomb shelters, the military says.

Gatherings are also restricted to 10 people outdoors and 50 people indoors in those areas, the IDF Home Front Command says.

The restrictions are valid till Sunday at 6 p.m., but will likely be extended further amid the fighting.

Hezbollah praises the massive Hamas operation against Israel, and says it is message to Arab countries normalizing with Israel.

The terror group Hezbollah says it is in direct contact with the Hamas leadership in Gaza and abroad, and calls on Arab and Muslim peoples around the world to declare their support to Hamas and the Palestinian people, adding that armed resistance is the only way to confront the Israeli “aggression.”

Hezbollah adds that the “Al-Aqsa Deluge” operation launched by Hamas against Israel is a message to the international community and the Arab and Muslim world, in particular those countries seeking normalization with Israel.

It also calls on the Israeli government to learn the “important lessons” taught by the “Palestinian resistance.”

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives a statement on October 7, 2023 (Screen grab)

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gives his first public statement on the massive attack by the Hamas terror group, saying the country is at war.

“Citizens of Israel, we are at war,” he says. “And we will win.”

“The enemy will pay a price like they have never known before,” he says, in his first public statement on the matter, some five hours since the start of the assault by the Gaza-based terror group.

There are reports of a number of dead and nearly 300 wounded as terrorists infiltrate a number of southern towns and thousands of rockets are fired at the center and south of the country.

Israeli residents near the Gaza Strip continue to ask for help and report on shooting by terrorists inside the towns while there is little or no IDF presence on the streets.

A pregnant Kibbutz Sufa resident speaks to Channel 12 from a safe room with her two-year-old child and close family members, saying: “They are shooting at our house, they are trying to break down the door of the safe room.”

She reports that her husband and four other armed residents are fighting in the streets with no aid from the military.

“I don’t understand how this is still going on. We’re in this situation since 6 a.m.,” she says. “Four people cannot fight them off alone

“Send help, please,” she cries.

Residents in other areas near the Gaza Strip report of unprecedented fighting on all major Israeli media sources. In an Instagram story timed to 9:55 a.m. cited by Ynet, a resident of Kfar Gaza writes: “I’m begging you!!! We can’t catch anyone! There are terrorists in Kfar Gaza, send forces to Kibbutz Kfar Gaza!!!”

A Channel 12 reporter in Beersheba describes receiving dozens of requests for help from residents of the Gaza Strip.

Mirjam Reijnen, a 42-year-old volunteer firefighter in Nahal Oz, tells AP: “With rockets we somehow feel safer, knowing that we have the Iron Dome (missile defense system) and our safe rooms. But knowing that terrorists are walking around communities is a different kind of fear,” she said, adding that she and her three kids have been too scared to leave the shelter even for a moment to use the bathroom.

Hamas says it has launched 5,000 rockets at Israel in an early morning surprise attack it calls “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

Mohammad Deif, the Hamas military commander, issues a statement saying that the ongoing attacks are in retaliation for Israel’s “desecration” of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.

He adds that Israel killed and wounded hundreds of Palestinians this year, and that Israel rejected offers for prisoner exchange deals.

Over 5,000 missiles were fired, Deif claims.

“Today, the people are bringing back the revolution and reviving the March of Return,” he says.

He urges Arabs in Jerusalem and inside Israel, in the Negev, the Galilee and northern Israel “set the earth on fire under the feet of the occupiers.”

He further calls on the “Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon” — countries with terror movements that are militarily supported by Iran — to “merge their resistance with that of the Palestinians today,” and “start marching towards Palestine now.”

Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas who is considered to be its leader in the West Bank, issued a statement along the same lines, calling on the Arab and Islamic nations to join “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.”

The video has been shared by Ryan Rozbiani @RyanRozbiani with the caption: “Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the missile attack, stating the target was the headquarters of Israel’s Unit 8200 in Tel Aviv. Activating air defenses in Tel Aviv to try to confront a heavy missile barrage from Hezbollah. Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv has halted all air traffic due to the missile launches.”

In a statement, the Iran-backed group said it had fired missiles at the Nirit area in the Israeli capital. In a Telegram post, the Lebanese group said they carried out the recent attack in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of protecting the Lebanese people. Hezbollah’s statement came after a video verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency.

According to a Reuters report, sirens sounded all around Tel Aviv during the airstrike. No casualties have been reported in the attack so far. Citing Israeli media reports, Al Jazeera reported that all air traffic at Ben Gurion airport was suspended after Hezbollah carried out airstrikes and the Israeli military declared a state of emergency in the Tel Aviv region.

The Israeli military confirmed that Hezbollah fired at least 20 rockets toward Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in a fierce military conflict since the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

 The drone strike killed one person in his apartment building, and injured 10 others.[\[1\]](#cite_note-toll-1)
[\[4\]](#cite_note-:1-4)
 The drone was spotted but not intercepted due to what Israel attributed to human error, with the Houthis asserting that they had developed a drone with the ability to evade the [Iron Dome](/wiki/Iron_Dome "Iron Dome")

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

The image (<image:58>) appears in multiple sources. One source, from LBC Group, describes an explosion in a Tel Aviv building, with bomb disposal experts on the scene, published on July 19, 2024. ([https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en](https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/middleeastnews/784660/explosion-in-tel-aviv-building-bomb-disposal-experts-on-site-israeli-p/en))

Another source, from The Times of Israel, uses the image in an article about a rocket attack from Gaza on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-october-7-2023/)) A third source, from india.com, published on October 22, 2024, reports that Hezbollah fired 20 rockets at Tel Aviv. ([https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/](https://www.india.com/news/israel-hezbollah-war-hezbollah-fires-20-rockets-at-israels-capital-tel-aviv-horrific-videos-go-viral-watch-7342129/))


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Houthi attacks on Tel Aviv, Israel. One attack, which occurred on July 19, 2024, involved a drone and resulted in one death and several injuries. The Houthis claimed responsibility for this attack, which targeted an apartment building. Another attack, which occurred in December 2024, involved a missile and caused at least 16 injuries. <image:58> <image:131>

The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Houthi_drone_attack_on_Israel)), Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-tel-aviv-blast-apparently-caused-by-drone-2024-07-19/)), and The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html)).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is supported by the evidence. The reverse image search reveals that the image was used in an article about an explosion in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. Furthermore, web searches confirm that a Houthi drone attack occurred on the same date, targeting an apartment building in Tel Aviv.

*   Over 40 airlines have canceled flights in and out of Israel amid the ongoing war.
*   At least 900 people have died in Israel following surprise attacks by Hamas militants.

 during which at least 687 Palestinians have been killed and 3,800 more have been injured, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While the evidence confirms the attack, there is no information to verify that the image depicts the aftermath of the attack. The image search reveals that the image shows a crowded airport in Israel, but it does not provide any context about the attack. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. `not enough information`

Rob D'Amico, a former FBI supervisory special agent, appears on CNN on Friday, July 19.

CNN

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

When computers and tech systems around the globe [went down Friday](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk/index.html)
, many people had one question: How could this happen in 2024?

A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the [fragility of the global economy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/recovery-global-crowdstrike-outage/index.html)
 and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought.

**CrowdStrike is everywhere:** Numerous Fortune 500 companies use [CrowdStrike’s cybersecurity software](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer/index.html)
 to detect and block hacking threats. July 19, 2024, global tech outage news

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

 in Turkey and Syria.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

.

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. [Ynet](/wiki/Ynet "Ynet")
 reported that she also cooked at times with basic ingredients she was provided.[\[36\]](#cite_note-toimalnutrition-38)

The [Qassam Brigades](/wiki/Qassam_Brigades "Qassam Brigades")
 (the militant wing of the Hamas movement) claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)
 They did not name any of them, or show photographs, but they claimed that one of the three was a US citizen and released a short video with text in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
 The video depicted three unidentifiable corpses with their faces obscured by censor bars.[\[42\]](#cite_note-44)
 The Brigades did not give details of how the hostages supposedly died, but said they were killed by the Israeli military.[\[c\]](#cite_note-46)

> "In exchange for them, your own army killed 3 of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a USA citizenship" - Qassam Brigades, 9 June 2024.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)

Rescue
------

The IDF said that they worked with [Shin Bet](/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet")
 and Israeli police to free the four Israeli hostages.[\[44\]](#cite_note-ynet8june-47)
 It was also later reported that the operation was [aided by intelligence support from the United States](/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war "United States support for Israel in the Gaza war")
[\[45\]](#cite_note-cbs8junebrennan-48)

.[\[46\]](#cite_note-49)
 The operation was planned for several weeks, and was carried out after an intelligence opportunity arose.[\[14\]](#cite_note-bbc-16)
 Some of the special forces members entered the refugee camp in a vehicle with a mattress on top, posing as [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Gaza_Strip_evacuations "Gaza Strip evacuations")

 by the Israeli military since the Gaza war began in early October.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since October 7 and the besieged enclave faces dire shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

On Saturday, dozens of Palestinians, [including five journalists](/news/2024/7/6/five-journalists-killed-as-israel-steps-up-bombardment-across-gaza)
, were killed as the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of the territory.

Videos taken at the scene of the attack on the UNRWA school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat showed twisted metal at the collapsed building. Emergency workers also tried to cover two bodies as they were quickly brought into the medical complex.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement that 50 injured Palestinians were taken to the hospital.

In a [statement](https://x.com/IDF/status/1809662855660360020)
 shared on social media on Saturday night, the Israeli army said its air force “struck several terrorists” in the area of al-Jaouni school.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said hundreds of Palestinian families had sought shelter at the school after they were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza.

The families “chose the middle area \[of the Gaza Strip\] because Israeli forces said the middle area is a safe zone”, Khoudary said.

“Everyone in the Gaza Strip believes that they are not safe, wherever they go.”

Last month, an Israeli attack on an UN-linked school – also in Nuseirat refugee camp – [killed at least 40 people](/news/2024/6/6/israel-bombs-unrwa-school-in-gaza-kills-32-displaced-palestinians)

“Concrete slabs fell on us, and suddenly, we found ourselves surrounded by the dead and injured. All of my family members were either injured or killed,” [Musab said](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/no-shelter-war-bombing-block-2-unrwa-nuseirat-school)
 in testimony shared by UNRWA.

“We were sleeping, and at two in the morning, missiles rained down on us. A young boy could be seen sifting through pools of blood on the ground.

Footage shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir el-Balah and verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency also showed children and young people being rushed from ambulances.

They included a girl with a bandaged arm, another with a bloodied face and a boy bandage across his head. They pulled us from under the rubble, and all we saw were shrapnel, debris, and dust. How will we live?”

Israeli air strike on Gaza school kills at least 16

Shock and horror at scene of Gaza blast

**At least 16 people have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials have said. Dozens more have been injured.**

The building was sheltering thousands of displaced people at Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel said it had struck several Hamas “terrorists operating in structures located in the area of Al-Jaouni School”.

A local source said the target was a room allegedly used by Hamas police. A spokeswoman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said the claims were "very, very serious" and should be investigated.

The attack comes as [hopes rise that a deal between Israel and Hamas is on the horizon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3gvp5q9y2go)
, following months of false starts.

Israel has announced it will send a team of negotiators next week to discuss a hostage release deal with Hamas.

It comes after a senior US administration official said Hamas had agreed to "pretty significant adjustments" to its position regarding a potential ceasefire.

A senior Hamas source told the Reuters news agency on Saturday that the group had agreed to begin talks on releasing Israeli hostages 16 days after the proposed first phase of an agreement aimed at ending the Gaza war.

Video from the scene of the Nuseirat school strike shows adults and children screaming in a smoke-filled street covered in dust and rubble, as they run to help the wounded.

Eyewitnesses told the BBC that the attack targeted the upper floors of the school, which is located near a busy market.

The BBC understands that up to 7,000 people were using the building as shelter.

One woman told the AFP news agency how some children were killed as they were reading the Koran when the building was hit.

"This is the fourth time they have targeted the school without warning," she said.

Hamas said five local journalists were among those killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday. Many were women and children."

She added it was not the first time Israel had made such claims, and that they should be investigated.

A previous attack in June on another packed UN-run school in Nuseirat [killed at least 35 people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggq0jygq6o)
.

Local journalists told the BBC at the time that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school.

After that attack, Israel’s military said it had “conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound” in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.

The head of the Unrwa described the June incident as "horrific" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was "shocking" but could not be confirmed.

Israel’s war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's offensive, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel has regularly accused Unrwa of supporting Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries.

The organisation has rejected this.

In April, a UN investigation found Israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged militant groups, but also said it could improve its neutrality, staff vetting and transparency.

At least 50 people were injured in the strike, Gaza officials say.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had hit the school buildings, saying it had taken "numerous steps" to "mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise aerial surveillance and additional intelligence".

Hamas militants were using the location as a "hideout" to carry out attacks against IDF troops, it said.

"Hamas continues to systematically violate international law by exploiting civilian structures and the civilian population as human shields for its terrorist attacks against the State of Israel," it added.

Hamas called the attack a “massacre” on “defenceless displaced civilians”.

Many of the dead and wounded were women, children and the elderly, the group claimed via its English language Telegram channel.

The IDF said it was "looking into the details" of the incident.

Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.

"We don’t have all the information yet. <image:2684>!Reuters People walk through the ruins of a school that was hit by an airstrike, killing at least 16 people. Since the war began, we have had more than half of our facilities hit," Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director, told the BBC regarding the latest attack.

"Many of them were shelters, and as a result at least 500 people sheltering in those facilities have been killed. Members of their family were also reportedly targeted.

More than 100 journalists have lost their lives in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, according to Reporters Without Borders.

Hamas said the five latest fatalities brings the number to 158.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, [said](https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1833976405149057277)
 the evacuation was a "highly complex operation" that was "completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together."

A WHO [report](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-09-2024-who-analysis-highlights-vast-unmet-rehabilitation-needs-in-gaza/)

Sept. agency, UNRWA, says this is the fifth time the al-Jaouni school has been hit since the start of the war. Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said humanitarian staff are being “disregarded” in the Gaza war.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

Conscription has faced strong opposition throughout American history from prominent figures like [Daniel Webster](/wiki/Daniel_Webster "Daniel Webster")

\]

In [colonial times](/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Colonial history of the United States")
, the [Thirteen Colonies](/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies")
 used a [militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States) "Militia (United States)")
 system for defense. And when any individual or combination of individuals, undertakes to decide for any man when he shall work, where he shall work, at what he shall work, and for what he shall work, he or they practically reduce him to slavery."[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)

### National Guard

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Conscription_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: National Guard")\
\]

The [Militia Act of 1903](/wiki/Militia_Act_of_1903 "Militia Act of 1903")
 reorganized the federally supported state militias as the National Guard, aligning their training with active duty needs so they could be quickly put into federal service.

In 1933, Congress reorganized the National Guard under its [Article I enumerated power](/wiki/Enumerated_powers_(United_States) "Enumerated powers (United States)")
 to "raise and support armies" instead of its power to "Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia".[\[16\]](#cite_note-16)
 This avoids the constraint on federal militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

Able-bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45 outside of the National Guard are defined in the Militia Act and under the laws of some states as the [unorganized militia](/wiki/Militia_(United_States)#Unorganized_militia "Militia (United States)")
, which may be called into state or federal service as needed.

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")
 created the Board of Inquiry to question the conscientious objectors' sincerity.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 [Military tribunals](/wiki/Military_tribunals_in_the_United_States "Military tribunals in the United States")
 tried men found by the Board to be insincere for a variety of offenses, sentencing 17 to [death](/wiki/Capital_punishment "Capital punishment")
, 142 to [life imprisonment](/wiki/Life_imprisonment "Life imprisonment")
, and 345 to [penal labor](/wiki/Penal_labor "Penal labor")
 camps.[\[24\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShenk200562-24)
 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. On numerous occasions, General Hershey told Congress that for every man drafted, three or four more were scared into volunteering.[\[49\]](#cite_note-49)
[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 Assuming that his assessment was accurate, this would mean that more than 11 million men volunteered for service because of the draft between January 1954 and April 1975.[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)

The policy of using the draft to incentivize voluntary enlistment was unique in American history. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Wikipedia article "Conscription in the United States" details the history of the draft in the US, including its use in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It provides statistics on the number of draftees during these conflicts. The article also mentions the Selective Service System and the legal framework for conscription, including the role of the National Guard and the unorganized militia. It does not mention the US reinstituting the draft in 2024.

The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The United Nations News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:1>). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The US was expected to vote on the draft resolution on November 20.

The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population.

Unusually well-kempt American draftees report for duty at Fort Slocum, Long Island, during the national call to arms in June 1917.

In an effort to bolster the dwindling number of volunteers—only 300,000 had come forward by 1916—the Military Service Act became law in Canada on July 6, 1917. Some were lucky like me, but many, certainly most, were kidnapped by government and compelled, at great cost to serve as quasi-slaves.

### Mobilizing America for the Second World War

After the war, Congress consistently declined to extend the system of military draft or compulsory service. Draftees were sorted into a variety of classifications from I-A, designating those who were fit and available immediately for military service; to I-A-O, which identified a conscientious objector available for military service in a noncombat role; to IV-F, for those who were physically or “morally” unfit. During the Vietnam era, from August 1964 through February 1973, a total of 1,857,304 young American men had been pressed into military service through the Selective Service system.

Although the draft had ended and the American armed forces had become an all-volunteer enterprise, the requirement for young men to register for the draft remained in effect until it was also suspended in April 1975. Whether that has been a fundamental blessing to mankind, or a curse, remains very much an open question.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Content: "5 when the words “Fuck Israel” were painted over a Pride flag painted the previous day. 

The rock was originally painted with the Palestinian flag on May 21 as part of a [protest](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/hundreds-march-across-ann-arbor-in-solidarity-with-palestine/)
 in support of Palestinian people, according the LSA junior Salma Hamamy said. “We are met, time and time again, with people coming to paint over the rock and silence our voices and write hateful messages, yet no one ever says anything.”

Hamamy was part of a WhatsApp groupchat of a few dozen Arab students who were the ones mainly responsible for the Palestinian paintings on the rock, she said. 

Pro-Israel messages on the Rock included “Israel wants peace” and “Stop Jewish hate” painted in the blue and white colors of the Israeli flag, as well as stars of David that represent both the flag and the Jewish faith.  

The paint disputes extended beyond just the Rock. They were just very persistent about covering up the Israel flag.” 

After an argument, Stoloff and Kalonymos came to the agreement that Kalonymos could paint over the Israeli flag with white spray paint, which would later be covered by the pride flag wrapped around the entire rock. 

“We didn’t want anything to escalate, so we agreed,” Kalonymos said, “So my friends and I painted this light box with Palestinian civil flags. When Hamamy’s WhatsApp group chat saw the Pride flag, it was agreed that there would be no more painting of the rock during Pride month. 

Saturday morning, Stoloff got out of the shower and opened her phone to a text with an image of the Rock. <image:2712>
    
    The Rock was painted with pro-Palestinian messages on May 21, 2021. <image:2714>

Several celebrities are using social media to show support for Israel and denounce Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians which left at least 1,000 people dead.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From [Gal Gadot](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/gal-gadot-reacts-to-israeli-palestine-conflict-101696757328407.html)
, Sonam Kapoor, [Gigi Hadid](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/what-is-gigi-hadid-and-bella-hadids-connection-with-palestine-mohamed-anwar-hadid-101697011221005.html)
 to Dwayne Johnson, celebrities are taking to social media to show their support for [Israel](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-position-vis-a-vis-israel-palestine-conflict-101697021932828.html)
 amid the country’s declared war against [Hamas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-war-live-updates-hamas-jerusalem-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-strip-lebanon-joe-biden-qatar-101696981753474.html)
 following the attack by the Palestinian militants last weekend. She re-posted a viral infographic via her Instagram Story that stated, “It is absolutely reasonable and logical to be opposed to the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians while simultaneously calling for the protection of Jews in Israel and around the world”.

Liev Schreiber
--------------

In his Instagram stories, the Ray Donovan star, 56, shared a post from the organisation StandWithUs, dedicated to opposing anti-semitism, which included an image of the Israeli flag and read, “Now and always, we stand with the people of Israel!” Below the post, he wrote, “We stand with the people of Israel and the IDF in their fight against Hamas and other terrorist groups. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,” she wrote on Instagram.

Dwayne Johnson
--------------

Actor Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, posted a long note, wherein he ‘condemned and denounced terrorism’. He wrote, “I stand with my Israeli friends in the face of these unprovoked, barbaric terrorist attacks. The sanctity of our common humanity will hopefully serve to heal the unimaginable wounds of division.

Memes of Israelis holding flags in front Dome of the Rock circulate on Facebook
===============================================================================

Palestinians and Jordanians to respond to this trend

Last updated: September 15, 2018 | 20:05

![Memes of Israelis holding flags in front Dome of the Rock circulate on Facebook](//media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2Fimport%2F2016%2F7%2F20%2F1_16a080e42e8.1865803_1200962361_16a080e42e8_large.jpg?w=480&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max)

Ramallah: New facebook memes in which Israelis post photoshopped images of themselves with Israeli flags in front of the Dome of the Rock are doing rounds on the social media.

The Jewish Press reported that the trend began when Haim Brosh shared a photoshopped image of himself holding the Israeli flag in front of the Dome of the Rock, with the title of the Zionist song “Carry a flag unto Zion” and a call for the Israeli government to finally raise the Israeli flag on Al Haram Al Sharif.

The Israeli police arrested Brosh for half an hour for questioning and later advised him to cease his subversive activities and released him instantly.

“How bored are the Israel police,” Brosh wrote on his facebook page after his release.

Since then, images of many Israelis holding their flag in front of the Dome of the Rock are circulating on the social media with huge public support and the Israeli police incapable to even summon those people for questioning. “We will figure out the right response to answer to this fierce campaign,” he told Gulf News.

“Raising the Israeli flag on the Dome of the Rock is the Zionist lifetime dream that will never come true.”

He said that the speakers of Al Aqsa Mosque and the other mosques have been instructed to highlight the Muslim origin of Al Haram Al Sharif as a pure and undisputed Muslim property.

He said that after the Israeli occupation forces captured Al Haram Al Sharif in 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli government signed the status quo agreements according to which Jews are allowed to visit but banned from praying in the holy shrine.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. [Photo Credit: Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP]")The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by Israeli forces is a reoccurring issue in the weekly field reports gathered by Al-Haq. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:65>)
web_search("Israeli army dog attack Palestinian woman")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:65>

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source, from Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)), describes an incident from December 2011 where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a Palestinian woman. The article includes a photo of a dog attacking a woman.

Another source, from Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), published on January 6, 2025, discusses an attack by an Israeli combat dog on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023. The image <image:65>

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image. The reverse image search did not yield any results. The web search revealed two incidents involving Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, but neither of them matches the image in the claim. One incident occurred in December 2011, and the other in late October 2023. The claim states the image is from June 2024.

Based on the evidence, there is no information to verify the claim that the image is authentic.

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source, from Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)), describes an incident from December 2011 where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a Palestinian woman. The article includes a photo of a dog attacking a woman.

Another source, from Middle East Eye ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), published on January 6, 2025, discusses an attack by an Israeli combat dog on a pregnant Palestinian woman in late October 2023.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

One incident occurred in December 2011, and the other in late October 2023. The claim states the image is from June 2024.

Based on the evidence, there is no information to verify the claim that the image is authentic.
