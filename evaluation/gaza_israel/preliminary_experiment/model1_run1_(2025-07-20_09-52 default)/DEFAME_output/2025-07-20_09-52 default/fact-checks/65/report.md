WAFA reported on July 20, 2025, that the Israeli army issued new displacement orders in Deir al-Balah.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted in March 2025 during Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip. The attacks resulted in casualties. An article from Al Jazeera mentions an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah that killed three people, including a child.

The claim states that the image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians. The evidence confirms the bombardment and the casualties. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. More information is needed to confirm that the image depicts the specific event described in the claim.
