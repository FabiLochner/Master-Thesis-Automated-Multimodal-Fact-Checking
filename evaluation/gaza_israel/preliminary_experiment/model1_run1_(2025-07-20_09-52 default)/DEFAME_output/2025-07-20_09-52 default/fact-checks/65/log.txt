Content: The article from Le Monde, published on October 30, 2023, features images of the bombing in Gaza. It includes images of Deir Al-Balah on October 28, 2023. <image:i>, <image:j>. The article also mentions the interruption of internet access in Gaza.

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is partially verifiable. While there is evidence of Israeli bombardments in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, resulting in casualties, the image in the claim has not been verified to depict the specific event described. Therefore, the image's origin and context are not fully confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
