Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/2018/07/25/trumps-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-vandalized/11314069007/): 
Content: The search result from the Associated Press reports that Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. The vandalism was reported around 3:30 a.m. and a pickax was used. The star was placed in 2007. <image:1>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-855930): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article on May 29, 2025, reporting that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. <image:1>. The article includes a photograph of the vandalized star.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized): 
Content: The search result from FOX 11 reports that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker that read "Israeli snipers target children." <image:966> The article states that Gadot received the star in March of the same year. The American Jewish Committee posted a photo of the vandalized star online.

The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which is confirmed to be Gal Gadot's star, as reported by [FOX 11](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized) and [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-855930). However, the claim that the vandalism occurred in March 2025 is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
