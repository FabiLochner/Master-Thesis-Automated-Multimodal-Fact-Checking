### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is a forum post on Nairaland.com discussing an image of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, in a hijab. The post references a tweet that juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise, suggesting an escape tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes. The post also includes comments from other users discussing the situation and the actions of Israel. The post was made on June 26, 2025. ![image 57](media/88.jpg) is included in the post.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 57](media/88.jpg)) of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has been circulating, particularly during the Israel-Hezbollah war, with claims of him escaping an assassination attempt in Lebanon, as discussed on [Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape/1). [JFeed](https://www.jfeed.com/news-israel/ismail-qaani-mossad-agent-rumors) discusses rumors of Qaani being a Mossad agent, with reports of his disappearance and house arrest following an Israeli airstrike.

The New Arab published an article on October 7, 2024, stating that Esmail Qaani is in good health, mentioning claims of a possible assassination by Israel. The image is not mentioned in this article.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has been circulating with claims related to the Israel-Hezbollah war and alleged assassination attempts. The Nairaland forum post and JFeed articles discuss the image in the context of Qaani's movements and potential threats. However, The New Arab article from October 7, 2024, states that Qaani is in good health, without mentioning the image.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image or the circumstances surrounding it. The claim that the image depicts Qaani in disguise due to fear of Israeli bombing is supported by the context of the image's circulation and related discussions.

Further verification would require confirming the image's origin and the events surrounding its creation.


## Final Judgement
The image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has been circulating with claims related to the Israel-Hezbollah war and alleged assassination attempts. While the image's authenticity is not definitively confirmed, it has been associated with discussions about Qaani's movements and potential threats. The claim that the image depicts Qaani in disguise due to fear of Israeli bombing is supported by the context of the image's circulation and related discussions.
