Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape/1): 
Content: The search result from Nairaland discusses a photo of Esmail Qaani in a hijab. The photo was circulated during the Israel-Hezbollah war, suggesting his escape when an attempt was made on his life while in Lebanon. The post is dated June 27.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jfeed.com/news-israel/ismail-qaani-mossad-agent-rumors): 
Content: The article from JFeed, published on June 25, 2025, discusses rumors that Esmail Qaani, the former commander of Iran’s Quds Force, might be a spy for Israel’s Mossad. The rumors gained traction after Qaani's disappearance following an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on October 4, 2024. The article mentions reports from The Sun, Middle East Eye, and Hindustan Times in October 2024, suggesting that Iranian authorities placed Qaani under house arrest and interrogated him. The article also mentions Qaani's reported death in June 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims): 
Content: The New Arab published an article on October 7, 2024, stating that Esmail Qaani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, is in good health. The article mentions claims of a possible assassination by Israel. <image:57> is not mentioned.

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is misleading.
Justification: The image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab has been circulating with claims related to the Israel-Hezbollah war and alleged assassination attempts, as discussed on [Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape/1) and [JFeed](https://www.jfeed.com/news-israel/ismail-qaani-mossad-agent-rumors). While the image's authenticity is not definitively confirmed, it has been associated with discussions about Qaani's movements and potential threats. The claim that the image depicts Qaani in disguise due to fear of Israeli bombing is supported by the context of the image's circulation and related discussions.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
