### Evidence from `web_search`
On January 7, 2025, NPR reported that President-elect Donald Trump said "all hell will break out" if Hamas does not release hostages by the time he takes office, during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago (![image 67](media/2025-07-18_13-25-1752845134-711302.jpg)). CNN also reported on January 7, 2025, that Trump warned that if the hostages whom Hamas is still holding in Gaza are not released by his inauguration on January 20, “all hell will break out in the Middle East” (<image:i>).

Reuters also published an article on January 7, 2025, referencing Trump's statement and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel, where Hamas is demanding a complete end to the Israeli assault on Gaza in exchange for the release of hostages (![image 71](media/2025-07-18_13-26-1752845165-567006.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that on January 7, 2025, Donald Trump, then President-elect, stated that "all hell will break out in the Middle East" if Hamas did not release the hostages by the time he took office. The reports from NPR and CNN corroborate this statement, and Reuters also referenced Trump's statement in the context of the ongoing conflict.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by multiple reliable sources, including NPR, CNN, and Reuters, which reported on Donald Trump's statement made on January 7, 2025. These sources confirm that Trump warned of dire consequences if Hamas did not release Israeli hostages by the time he assumed office.
