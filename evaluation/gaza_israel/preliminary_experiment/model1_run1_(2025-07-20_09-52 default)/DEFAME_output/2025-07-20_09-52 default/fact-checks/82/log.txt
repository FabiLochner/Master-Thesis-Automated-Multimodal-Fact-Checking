The claim '<image:51> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. The image used in the claim, depicting Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, was taken on October 7, 2023, during a government session in Tel Aviv, and not on August 25, 2024, as the claim suggests, as reported by [Kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/08/25/old-photo-of-israeli-ministers-in-shelter-republished-as-during-hezbollahs-recent-bombing-of-sites-in-israel/).

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
