Useful result: From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/what-kamala-harris-has-said-israel-gaza-war): 
Content: An article published on July 23, 2024, by Al-Monitor discusses Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza war. The article mentions Harris's call for Israelis and Palestinians to return to the negotiating table and her concerns about the protection of civilians in Gaza.

The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While Kamala Harris expressed support for Israel, including during a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, the specific statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, is not found in the provided sources. The search results show her support for Israel, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/kamala-harris-israel-policy), but not the exact quote.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
