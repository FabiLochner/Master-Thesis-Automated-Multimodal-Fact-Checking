The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While reports from January 2025, such as those from [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest) and the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event), indicate that Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from arrest and that he was invited to an event, there is no evidence of him fleeing to Poland on October 1, 2024, amid an Iranian missile attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
