Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east):

The article also mentions rallies and demonstrations, and includes images related to the conflict <image:1011>, <image:1012>, <image:1010>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o): 
Content: The BBC reports that Keir Starmer is facing calls for stronger action against Israel over the situation in Gaza. Starmer described the situation as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire. He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions. The article was published on June 4, 2025. <image:1023>

The claim 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The evidence indicates that Keir Starmer has commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including calls for a ceasefire and considering further actions, but there is no evidence from the provided sources, such as the [MAP article](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza), that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
