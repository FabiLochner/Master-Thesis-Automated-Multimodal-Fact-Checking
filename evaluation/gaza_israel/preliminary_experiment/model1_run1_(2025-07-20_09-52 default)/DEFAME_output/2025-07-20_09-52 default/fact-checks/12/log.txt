Content: The International Court of Justice published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The court found, by a vote of 11 to 4, that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The court also stated that Israel is obligated to end its unlawful presence as quickly as possible.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/): 
Content: The International Court of Justice delivered an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The UN Secretary-General's report on this opinion was published on December 19, 2024. The report discusses the context of the advisory opinion, including the situation after the October 7, 2023 attacks. It also mentions legal measures seeking accountability for violations of international law, including those in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/): 
Content: The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The article mentions a UN General Assembly resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law. <image:756>

The claim 'Israel has been declared an illegal state by the International Court of Justice in July 2024.' is misleading.
Justification: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's continued presence unlawful, as documented by the [ICJ](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176) and the [Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/). However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an "illegal state," but rather found its presence in the territory unlawful.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
