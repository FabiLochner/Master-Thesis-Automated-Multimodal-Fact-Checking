Content: The University at Buffalo published an article on December 2, 2024, stating that Mike Tyson did not pose with the Palestinian flag before his fight against Jake Paul. The article references a Reuters fact-check and quotes Siwei Lyu.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.factchecker.gr/2024/11/16/ai-generated-image-of-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/): 
Content: The search result from factchecker.gr states that the image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is not real and was created using an artificial intelligence tool. <image:1006>, <image:1008>. The image displays characteristics indicative of AI software manipulation.

The claim '<image:17> This is an authentic image of Mike Tyson posing with the Palestinian flag in the ring before his fight against Jake Paul on November, 15, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple sources, including fact-checking websites and news articles, confirm that the image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is AI-generated and not a real photograph. The image has been debunked by sources such as [srilanka.factcrescendo.com](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/ai-generated-image-falsely-shows-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/) and the [University at Buffalo](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html).
