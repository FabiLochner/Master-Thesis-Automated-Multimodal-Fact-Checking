Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-golan-heights-soccer-rocket-hezbollah-explained-97d4377713a209cf130b7b0f3476e1c4): 
Content: The Associated Press (AP) published an article discussing a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which killed 12 children. <image:k>. Israel accused Hezbollah of the attack, but Hezbollah denied responsibility. The article mentions that the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq rocket with a 53-kilogram warhead.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Majdal Shams attack that occurred on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights. The attack, a rocket strike on a soccer field, killed 12 Syrian Druze children and injured at least 42 others. Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, while Hezbollah denied responsibility. The article includes images of the attack site and the victims' funeral.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While a rocket attack on a soccer field in Majdal Shams on July 27, 2024, did occur, resulting in casualties, the image provided is unrelated to the event, as confirmed by the Anadolu Agency (AA) fact-check and other sources ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/rocket-attack-on-soccer-field-in-israeli-controlled-golan-heights-kills-10-people-israel-says](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/rocket-attack-on-soccer-field-in-israeli-controlled-golan-heights-kills-10-people-israel-says), [https://apnews.com/article/israel-golan-heights-soccer-rocket-hezbollah-explained-97d4377713a209cf130b7b0f3476e1c4](https://apnews.com/article/israel-golan-heights-soccer-rocket-hezbollah-explained-97d4377713a209cf130b7b0f3476e1c4), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)).
