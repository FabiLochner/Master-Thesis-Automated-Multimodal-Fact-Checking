The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While evidence from sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5285696/trump-un-human-rights-council-withdrawal) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/4/trump-to-withdraw-us-from-un-human-rights-council-extend-unrwa-funding-ban) indicates that Trump signed an executive order concerning UNRWA funding, the provided evidence does not support the specific date of January 20, 2025, as the date of the order.
