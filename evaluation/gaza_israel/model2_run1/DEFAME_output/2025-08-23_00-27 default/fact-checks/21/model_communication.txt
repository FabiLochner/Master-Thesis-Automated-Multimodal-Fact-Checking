Published On 4 Feb 20254 Feb 2025

United States President Donald Trump is planning to cut off US engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council and extend a funding ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, an unnamed White House official told US media outlets.

US news media, including Politico and NPR, reported on Monday that Trump was expected to sign an executive order withdrawing from the two UN bodies on Tuesday, the same day the White House is [expected to host](/news/2025/1/28/israels-netanyahu-to-meet-with-trump-at-white-house-next-week)
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime critic of the UN, and UNRWA in particular.

Since taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump has already withdrawn the US from [the World Health Organization (WHO)](/news/2025/1/28/what-a-us-exit-from-the-who-means-for-global-healthcare)
 and the [Paris climate agreement](/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out)
, which he also withdrew from during his first term – a move that was later reversed by the Biden administration.

Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the UN Human Rights Council would also not be a first for Trump, who withdrew from the council in his first term.

When the Trump administration quit the Human Rights Council in 2018, Trump’s then-UN envoy Nikki Haley claimed the move was due to “chronic bias” against Israel from the body, which is made up of 47 UN member states who are elected for four-year terms.

The council conducts periodic reviews of the human rights records of UN member states, including the US, which is due to undergo its next review in August.

During the council’s last review of the US in 2020, countries offered recommendations on how Washington might improve its human rights record, including by tackling racism and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison.

The council is also responsible for appointing human rights experts to serve as independent UN special rapporteurs.

Several UN special rapporteurs have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, including, most notably, the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese.

As an elected member of the council, most recently from 2022-2024, the US has also leveraged its position to criticise the human rights record of other countries.

UNRWA order comes as Netanyahu visits White House
-------------------------------------------------

Trump’s plan to sign another executive order specifically targeting the embattled UNRWA coincides with Netanyahu’s visit to the White House.

According to a UNRWA [situation report](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-156-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem)
, Israeli forces killed 272 UNRWA staff members during Israel’s 15-month onslaught on the Gaza Strip and repeatedly attacked UNRWA buildings, including schools where thousands of Palestinians were seeking shelter.

In October, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed two bills [banning UNRWA operations](/news/2024/10/29/what-does-unrwa-do-and-why-has-israel-banned-it-from-west-bank-gaza)
 within Israel’s borders, including occupied East Jerusalem, which came into effect last week. Founded by the UN General Assembly in 1949, UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

![UNRWA at a glance](/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/INTERACTIVE-UNRWA-at-a-glance-1706592698.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

The US was UNRWA’s biggest donor, providing $300m to $400m a year, but Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel made unfounded accusations about a dozen UNRWA staff taking part in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas.

Although an independent report found that Israeli authorities [did not provide evidence](/news/2024/4/22/no-evidence-of-unrwa-staff-links-terrorist-groups-independent-review)
 for their claims to the UN, the US Congress decided to formally suspend contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. The [UN later found](/news/2024/8/5/un-says-nine-employees-may-have-been-involved-in-october-7-hamas-attack)
 that nine employees may have been involved in the attack and were fired.

UNRWA is playing a vital role in Gaza’s recovery as a fragile ceasefire continues to hold between Israel and Hamas.

Trump and Netanyahu are expected to discuss the next phase of the ceasefire deal when they meet.

Speaking after Netanyahu arrived in the US on Monday, Trump said there were “no guarantees” that the ceasefire deal would hold.

 as “killing all prospects for peace in the Middle East”. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images

The Guardian view on Gaza’s future: Israel should end the killing. Israel has killed more than 62,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

Israel’s former intelligence chief Aharon Haliva, in charge when the Hamas atrocities of 2023 took place, was recently recorded [saying that](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/israeli-general-aharon-haliva-palestinians-7-october-gaza)
 “For every person on October 7, 50 Palestinians must die. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has authorised plans for the call up of 60,000 soldiers to seize and occupy Gaza City – forcing out hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and bringing further catastrophe to exhausted, desperate and traumatised civilians. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu has an alternative: [agree to a ceasefire proposal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/israel-to-respond-by-friday-gaza-truce-plan-hamas)
, already accepted by Hamas, and reportedly “almost identical” to an earlier plan presented by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, which Israel accepted.

An embattled Mr Netanyahu believes a forever war can keep him at the top and fend off the [corruption trial](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/30/benjamin-netanyahu-corruption-trial-delayed-ntwnfb)
 due to recommence imminently. Reports of military discontent should be regarded with caution: it has not prevented the Israel Defense Forces from drawing up and beginning to implement plans for the Gaza City offensive. But 74% of Israelis want the war to end, and there were [huge protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/netanyahu-criticises-protests-israel-handling-gaza-war-hostages)
 at the weekend, mostly reflecting concern for hostages and the toll on soldiers. A survey last month [found](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/israeli-media-completely-ignored-gaza-starvation-is-that-finally-changing)
 that 79% of Jewish Israelis were “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering in Gaza.

Internationally, however, it is the suffering of Palestinians that fuels demands for the war to end and daily erodes Israel’s status and alliances. Lashing out at critics such as Australia’s “weak” prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has merely made Mr Netanyahu look more desperate and isolated and [heightened the criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/australia-israel-tony-burke-netanyahu)
.

Palestinians in Gaza City can choose only whether to stay and face the Israeli onslaught, or attempt to flee, in their weakened state, with nowhere safe to go."

To imagine a different future, we must first understand the past.

Starmer urges unity at home and reiterates call for ceasefire in Middle East
============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Prime minister says UK should ‘unequivocally stand with Jewish community’ and reflects on deaths in Israel

Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to “unequivocally stand with the Jewish community”, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks.

The prime minister described it as “the darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust”, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath.

While he stood firm in his commitment to help “bring the hostages home”, he said “we must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East”.

He continued: “We will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.”

His comments come as the government earlier advised [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to show “restraint”, while the prime minister had warned that “sparks” from the Middle East conflict could “light touchpapers in our communities at home”.

A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday.

In London, the Met police said [17 people had been arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/tens-of-thousands-join-pro-palestinian-protest-in-london)
 after Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a “significant” policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events.

On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London’s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. The war is deepening and it is not moving towards the peace that we need, so we are urging the steps that will take us towards that peaceful settlement”.

The prime minister, in an article [for the Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/year-of-war-has-spread-vile-hatred-in-uk-says-keir-starmer-nsc3k29jz)
, called out the “vile hatred” that had been directed towards Jews and Muslims since the 7 October attacks.

Relatives carry the bodies of their deceased loved ones wrapped in shrouds after an Israeli attack in Deir el-Balah, Gaza. Clearly there’s a detachment from the British public opinion and what the government are saying.”

The former Conservative foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said what was needed from Israelis and Palestinians was “leadership that is prepared not to forget the past, but to move on to a political dialogue”.

    ! Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 as they chanted “bring them home”.

The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been “stripped of every human right” and remains “in hell”, as she called for her safe return.

Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone’s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent.

“How is it that she \[Emily\] is still imprisoned there after one year?” Damari said.

“Why isn’t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?”

Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said “we must not forget our humanity”, adding it was “heartening” to see so many people in attendance.

“I’m here today because it’s about memorial and remembrance,” she said. There are no further scheduled charter flights, but the situation would be kept under review.

Content: "It has strongly denied allegations of genocide, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

The government is also facing calls to "urgently" recognise the state of Palestine - including from Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Jeremy Wright.

Sir Jeremy told MPs he he had changed his mind the timeframe for such a move - traditionally seen as being part of a "two-state solution" - over the rhetoric coming from the Israeli government.

'Desperately needed aid'
------------------------

During the debate, protesters gathered outside Parliament to demand the end of arms sales to Israel, something that was repeatedly echoed by MPs, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The MP, who now sits as an independent, is calling for a public inquiry to uncover what he called the "murky history of what's gone on, the murky arms sales and the complicity in appalling acts of genocide".

He has tabled a draft bill to set up an inquiry to examine the "any UK military, economic or political cooperation" with Israel, with powers to question ministers and officials.

The bill is backed by prominent left-wing Labour MPs including Diane Abbott and Richard Burgon, four independent MPs, two Greens and members of Plaid Cymru and the SNP.

It has been scheduled for debate on 4 July, but is unlikely to become law without government backing.

Corbyn was among the MPs calling for a total embargo on the sale of arms to Israel - including parts for F-35 fighter jets.

Hamish Falconer said the UK had already taken steps to "ensure that weapons directly for use in Gaza have been suspended," and had stopped supplying F-35 parts "directly to Israel".

But he said the UK would continue to supply parts to the "global pool" of F-35 spares, as this was needed to help "the defence of Nato allies" and support the Ukraine war effort.

When it was put to him that Ukraine did not use F-35s, he said the planes were needed for the redeployment of F-15s, which were used in the fight against Russia.

But Corbyn and other critics insist the government's explanations lack credibility and they must know that the parts are being used to attack Palestinians in Gaza.

The Lib Dems are also urging a tougher stance from the government on Israel.

At prime minster's questions, Sir Ed Davey urged Keir Starmer to "push at the UN Security Council for humanitarian corridors to get the desperately needed aid urgently into Gaza".

Sir Keir said that the government is "working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in".

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,607 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,335 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the territory's health ministry.

Protesters lobbied Parliament as MPs debated Gaza

Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure from some of his own MPs to take further action against Israel over what they say is a genocide in Gaza.

At prime minister's questions, Sir Keir described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire.

He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.

But his words were not enough to satisfy opposition critics and left-wing Labour MPs, who are calling on the government to take stronger action against Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers.

It comes after aid distribution centres in Gaza were closed for the day, with the Israeli military warning roads leading to the sites will be considered "combat zones".

At least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire close to a distribution centre on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.

The Israel Defence Forces say its troops fired shots after identifying suspects who moved towards them "deviating from the designated access routes".

The UK's Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer faced the anger of backbench Labour MPs - many of whom were wearing red "stop arming Israel" badges - in the House of Commons.

Falconer said he was "appalled" by Palestinians being killed when trying to access aid sites, adding: "We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account."

He added: "Israel's unjustified block on aid into Gaza needs to end - it is inhumane.

"Israel must immediately allow the United Nations and aid partners to safely deliver all types of aid at scale to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity."

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday that last week’s Iranian ballistic missile attack “didn’t even scratch” the Israeli Air Force’s capabilities, and vowed that Israel would not be deterred from responding to such attacks by its enemies.

During a visit to Nevatim Airbase, which suffered damage during the attack, Gallant said Israel would choose the manner and time of its response, and that this should be taken not just as a statement of intent, but as a working plan, according to a statement from his office.

“The Iranians have not even scratched the capabilities of the Air Force."

Biden and Netanyahu speak as Gallant warns of ‘deadly’ surprise attack on Iran

Leaders talk for first time in weeks as US administration seeks to weigh in on Israel’s plans

Joe Biden and [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 spoke for the first time in weeks on Wednesday amid expectations of an imminent Israeli strike on Iran, which Yoav Gallant warned would be “deadly, precise and surprising”.

Netanyahu’s defence minister issued the warning in a video message on Israeli media on Wednesday night, broadcast after he postponed a scheduled trip to Washington.

Gallant said that the Iranian missile attack on Israel on 1 October had been a failure but would be avenged.

“Whoever attacks us will be hurt and will pay a price. The prime minister wanted the cabinet to vote on the attack plans first and to speak to Biden himself before Gallant held discussions with Pentagon officials, the report said.

In Lebanon on Wednesday, eight days into Israel’s ground invasion, clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces appeared to be spreading across the mountainous border area.

The militant group said it had pushed back Israeli troops near Labbouneh, close to the Mediterranean coast, and attacked units with rocket fire in the villages of Maroun el-Ras, Mays al-Jabal and Mouhaybib.

Four people were killed and 10 wounded by an Israeli airstrike in Wardanieh, near the coastal town of Sidon.

Heavy fire from Lebanon triggered rocket sirens and air defence interceptions across northern Israel on Wednesday, killing two people in the border town of Kiryat Shmona and wounding six in the major city of Haifa.

A quarter of Lebanon is now under Israeli evacuation orders, which have driven 1.2 million people from their homes. The Republican, who is in a close White House race against Harris, called Netanyahu last week and “congratulated him on the intense and determined operations that Israel carried out against Hezbollah”, according to Netanyahu’s office.

“World leaders want to speak and meet with President Trump because they know he will soon be returning to the White House and will restore peace around the globe,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said in a statement about that call, which a Trump ally, Senator Lindsey Graham, also joined.

There still appear to be disagreements within Israel’s security cabinet over an appropriate response to Iran’s firing of 180 ballistic missiles, an attack that was mostly intercepted by air defence systems but killed one person in the occupied West Bank and hit some Israeli military sites.

Netanyahu promised that Iran would pay for the attack, while Tehran has repeatedly warned that an Israeli attack on its soil would be met with further escalation.

Israel is fearful of a costly war of attrition with Iran while it is fighting in Gaza and [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
. Axios reported that the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, postponed a scheduled visit to Washington on Wednesday at Netanyahu’s insistence. At least 1,400 have been killed in the last three weeks.

During their call Biden emphasised to Netanyahu the “need to minimise harm to civilians, in particular in the densely populated areas of Beirut”.

The relationship between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu has deteriorated since the spring over Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza. Our attack will be deadly, precise and above all surprising, they will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,” the Israeli defence minister said.

Gallant’s video message was broadcast a few hours after the conversation between Netanyahu and Biden, their first in seven weeks, which was joined by the vice-president, Kamala Harris, whose presidential campaign could be upset by the widening hostilities in the Middle East and any consequent spike in oil prices. The US, Israel’s staunch ally, [is wary of being drawn into the fighting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/what-are-the-risks-involved-in-israeli-options-for-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran)
, and of oil price shocks.

The Biden administration is keen to weigh in on Israel’s plans and avoid surprises like the Israeli killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, although the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel had so far refused to share details. Biden said last week that [he would not support strikes on Iranian oil or nuclear sites](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/biden-says-us-discussing-possible-israeli-plans-to-attack-irans-oil-industry)
.

Netanyahu’s relationship with Biden has deteriorated significantly since the spring over Israel’s war in Gaza."

From [Source](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/): Found exact image on website with title: US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
Content: "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed while standing on the balcony of his safe house in Afghanistan when a CIA drone sent two Hellfire missiles to pulverize the terror leader and plotter of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The precision strike took place in the heart of downtown Kabul during the early hours Saturday, ending a 21-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden’s successor and marking the most significant US counterterror operation since the 2019 slaying of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The terror leader had stepped onto his balcony in the Shirpur neighborhood of Kabul when the US drone fired two specially designed RX9 Hellfire missiles dubbed “sword bombs” due to the blades that allow the weapon to tear through metal and walls without destroying entire structures.

President Biden confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death during an evening address in which he declared, “Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more.”

“Now we make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide: If you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,” Biden said.

Biden said of al-Zawahiri, “For decades, he was the mastermind behind the attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more.”

“He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats and American interests.”

 [!Map of drone strike <image:3863> 7](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/kabul-strike-new.jpg "Open a slideshow of all 7 article images.")

The drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death near Kabul.

None of al-Zawahiri’s family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties, the president said, calling the mission to eliminate the terrorist leader a “total success.”

The president also warned: “To those around the world who have continued to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.”

Biden’s remarks from the Blue Room balcony of the White House were reminiscent of President Barack Obama’s late-night announcement of the death of bin Laden in Pakistan more than 11 years ago.

“After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents \[George W.\] Bush, Obama and \[Donald\] Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year,” Biden said.

“He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike to remove him from the battlefield once and for all.

“This mission was carefully planned and rigorously to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him.”

Biden added: “We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone. And we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”

“You know, it can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re gonna see to it that won’t happen,” he said.

“This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can and will always make good on that solid, solid pledge.

Fox News, citing two intelligence sources, first reported on the death of the Egyptian-born surgeon who took over the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11 attacks after bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in 2011.

Al-Zawahiri had a $25 million bounty on his head over his indictment in the 1998 embassy bombings.

He’s also believed to have helped coordinate the atrocities that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., 21 years ago, which were masterminded by bin Laden and planned by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pending trial by a military tribunal.

Current and former officials began hearing Sunday afternoon that he’d been killed in a drone strike, sources told the Associated Press, but the administration delayed releasing the information until his death could be confirmed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid [confirmed in a statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1554187982407696387)
 Monday that a drone strike on a home in Kabul had taken place the day before.

The house was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior intelligence official told AP, raising questions about whether al-Zawahiri had received sanctuary from the Islamist group following the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.

The official added that a CIA ground team and aerial reconnaissance conducted after the drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death.

A senior Biden administration official noted: “Haqqani Taliban members took actions after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location.”

“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike,” the official said.

“The safe house used by Zawahiri is now empty.”

The Taliban spokesman said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.

“Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region,” Zabihullah wrote.

“Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.”

Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden are believed to have met in the late 1980s, when al-Zawahiri reportedly treated the Saudi millionaire in the caves of Afghanistan as Soviet bombardments shook the mountains around them.

Al-Zawahiri merged his group of Egyptian militants with bin Laden’s al Qaeda in the 1990s, and photos from that period often showed the two men sitting side by side.

Bin Laden provided al Qaeda with charisma and money, but al-Zawahiri brought tactics and organizational skills needed to forge militants into a network of cells in countries around the world.

“The strong contingent of Egyptians \[in al Qaeda\] applied organizational know-how, financial expertise, and military experience to wage a violent jihad against leaders whom the fighters considered to be un-Islamic and their patrons, especially the United States,” Steven A. Cook wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations last year.

There have been rumors of al-Zawahiri’s death for several years, but a video that surfaced in April showed him praising an Indian Muslim woman who had defied a ban on wearing a hijab, or headscarf.

That footage was the first proof in months that he was still alive.

As with bin Laden, al-Zawahiri’s whereabouts had been unknown before the operation that led to his death, though the most common rumors placed him either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan’s near-lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border.

ISWNews Analysis Group: US President Joseph Biden announced the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the recent US drone attack on the Afghan capital.

During a press conference at the White House, US President Joseph Biden claimed that Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaeda, was killed by the US military and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The assassination operation of Al-Zawahiri was carried out on Saturday, July 31, in three possible places in the city of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.

**

Al-Zawahiri had carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens. Now justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more. Our intelligence agencies discovered Ayman al-Zawahiri’s hiding place in the past months. He had moved to Kabul to be with his family members. “After carefully examining the convincing evidence about his position, I ordered precision strike to remove him from the battlefield.”

In this regard, the US media quoted officials of this country as saying that al-Zawahiri was on the balcony of his safe house in Sherpur area in the center of Kabul city when the US drone fired two missiles at him. Other members of his family were present in this building, but they were not harmed and only Al-Zawahiri was killed during this attack.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a statement in response to this attack that the recent attack in Kabul was carried out against a residential house in Sherpur area. He added: “The nature of this incident was not clear at first. The security and intelligence organizations of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) investigated the incident and found that the attack was carried out by American drones. The Islamic Emirate condemns this attack for whatever reason it was carried out and considers it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement. These actions repeat the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of America, Afghanistan and the region. Repetition of such actions will harm existing opportunities.”

Ayman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri was an Egyptian-born physician and theologian and the leader of the Islamic Jihad group in Egypt, who after joining Al-Qaeda as the second leader of this terrorist group was persecuted by Western countries, especially the United States. After the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011, Al-Zawahiri took over the leadership of Al-Qaeda.

Al-Zawahiri was opposed to ISIS from the beginning of its establishment, and perhaps one of the reasons for his removal is the creation of differences between the senior members of Al-Qaeda and pushing disaffected forces towards ISIS in Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries. Al-Zawahiri’s assassination will also create problems for America, because they carried out this assassination in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, and killing a guest is shameful act in the “Pashtun” culture. In addition, there is a possibility that Al-Qaeda will respond to America, and despite the weakening of this group’s organization in recent years, there is enough power to carry out revenge attacks against American positions.

Biden last year in an address said that US does not need to be on ground to fight terrorists. Last Sunday, the CIA showed how it can be done by killing Ayman al-Zawahiri

The US planned to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri over a period of several months. On July 31, 2022, two Hellfire missiles fired using a US drone ended the life of the al-Qaeda chief while he was sitting outside in his balcony, mincing him into shreds but without any damage to other individuals.

The CIA officials who were involved in the mission, according to _the Associated Press_, constructed “a pattern of life" and knew that Ayman al-Zawahiri liked sitting on the balcony of his building, which is located in Kabul’s Sherpur area.

Once his daily routine was established by the officials, they presented it to US president Joe Biden in the White House’s Situation Room weeks before the attack.

The officials were also aware that the Haqqani Taliban network provided the housing to Ayman al-Zawahiri and his family in Kabul. The AP reported that Zawahiri’s family along with him started living in the house once the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021.

People familiar with the developments told _CNNNews18_ that the building is close to Iranian and Turkish embassies.

After the US officials confirmed these details, they took more months to formulate an action plan. Several independent teams of analysts were brought on board to ensure that nearby civilians and infrastructure should not be targeted.

Another official familiar with the developments said that the now deceased al-Qaeda leader’s identity was verified on multiple occasions and for sustained periods of time before getting approval for the attack.

The plans were first formed in early April when two senior national security officials were first briefed on the intelligence. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan was then apprised of the developments. Over the next two months, a small group of officials of the US government vetted the intel and devised options for US president Biden.

Biden, when apprised of the developments in July, shortly after he returned from his Europe trip, bombarded CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Centre director Christy Abizaid regarding the accuracy of the data presented to him.

Biden made it clear that the attack should not lead to results like the 2021 drone attack that ended up killing civilians in Kabul. He also said that Afghans who helped the US should not be in jeopardy.

Biden gave the go-ahead after July 25, while he was recovering from Covid .

The success of the attack was confirmed when the Haqqani Taliban network restricted access to the safe house and relocated Zawahiri’s family.

“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians," Biden said in his address where he confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader, who headed the terrorist group for more than a decade, was eliminated.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

Biden laid out a three-phase [ceasefire proposal](/world/middle-east/whats-new-israel-ceasefire-proposal-biden-announced-2024-05-31/)

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/world/middle-east/obituary-tough-talking-haniyeh-was-seen-more-moderate-face-hamas-2024-07-31/)

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)). However, the evidence also shows conflicting reports. Newsweek reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the call ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)).

The claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign is supported by a report from PBS host Judy Woodruff, as cited in the Newsweek article. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu's offices casts doubt on the claim's veracity.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting reports and denials. Further verification would require confirmation of the phone call and the specific content of the conversation.

He may not be in office, but Donald Trump has been speaking with the powers that be about Israel’s war on Gaza—but it’s not in an effort to end the genocide.

Instead, Trump has allegedly been talking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a cease-fire deal, fearing that doing so could help Vice President Kamala Harris win in November, according to PBS.

“The reporting is that former President Trump is on the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel, urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed that would help the Harris campaign,” said PBS’s Judy Woodruff Monday night. Netanyahu’s office and Trump both [separately](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)
 denied the report.

“I did encourage him to get this over with. But he also criticized cease-fire demands.

During Biden’s speech at the Democratic National Convention on Monday, the president promised that his administration is working around the clock to bring “humanitarian assistance into Gaza,” “peace and security to the Middle East,” and to deliver a “cease-fire” and an end to the war. 

The president also nodded to the more than [3,500 protesters](https://apnews.com/article/democratic-convention-chicago-protests-war-gaza-f064683535bbbe93231d31ecc2dbafc7)

NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16958/gaza-ceasefire-talks-israel-hamas)) published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the Gaza cease-fire talks <image:4091>, <image:4092>, <image:4093>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)). However, the evidence also shows conflicting reports. Newsweek reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the call ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)).

The claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign is supported by a report from PBS host Judy Woodruff, as cited in the Newsweek article. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu's offices casts doubt on the claim's veracity.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting reports and denials. Further verification would require confirmation of the phone call and the specific content of the conversation.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire. However, there are conflicting reports about the content of the conversation. While some sources claim Trump urged Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the call.

Given the conflicting reports and denials from the involved parties, there is not enough definitive information to confirm the claim's veracity. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

A senior administration official said before the meetings with Biden and Harris that the “framework of the deal is basically there” but that there are “some very serious implementation issues that still have to be resolved”.

“There are some things we need from Hamas, and there are some things we need from the Israeli side, and I think you’ll see that play out here over the course of the coming week,” the official said.

Trump calls Harris remarks on Gaza war ‘disrespectful’ as he meets Netanyahu
============================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Former US president criticises vice-president after she said she would ‘not be silent’ about suffering of Palestinians

Donald Trump has called Kamala Harris’s statement on the Gaza war “disrespectful” before a meeting with the Israeli prime minister, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
, in Florida to discuss the conflict.

Harris, the US vice-president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had seemed to mark a change of tone on the [Israel-Gaza war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war)
 on Thursday after her own meeting with Netanyahu, when she declared she would “not be silent” about the suffering of Palestinians.

Trump criticised Harris on Friday before his meeting at his Mar-a-Lago home, calling her remarks “disrespectful” as he targeted her over an issue that has split the Democratic party.

“They weren’t very nice pertaining to Israel,” Trump said. “I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

[Right-wing Israeli politicians attacked Harris](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/israeli-right-wing-hits-out-at-kamala-harris-as-netanyahu-visit-polarises-opinion)
 and anonymous officials have suggested the remarks could make it more difficult to conclude a ceasefire deal.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. “And I would hope that those comments don’t change that.”

A Harris aide rejected a report in the Times of Israel that a senior official had said that Harris’ criticism would hinder the conclusion of a deal.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN.

Photographs showed Trump warmly greeting Netanyahu, who is concluding a one-week visit to the US that has been marked by large protests against the war. People stood along the route used by Netanyahu’s motorcade to visit Trump, holding up signs that read: “Ceasefire now” and “Convicted fellon \[sic\] invites a war criminal”.

!People hold Palestinian flags and signs saying: ‘Convicted fellon invites a war criminal’ and ‘Free Palestine’ <image:4112>[View image in fullscreen](#img-1)

Pro-Palestinian protesters line the route of Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Mar-a-Lago. “\[Biden’s\] and \[Harris’s\] message to PM Netanyahu was the same: it’s time to get the hostage and ceasefire deal done,” wrote Phil Gordon, Harris’s national security adviser.

Harris called the meeting “frank and constructive”, and said “Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters”. “Time will tell if we’re closer to a ceasefire deal,” he said.

The meeting is their first since Trump left the White House in 2020. And I will not be silent.”

Harris did not say how Netanyahu responded to the Biden administration’s offer of a three-part ceasefire that would begin with a withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from population centres and some hostages being released. So, to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you.”

The Democratic mayor of Dearborn, Abdullah Hammoud, said in an interview with Michigan public radio: “Many of us are waiting to see what policy platform Harris puts forward.” Hammoud has been outspoken on Gaza in a state where 13.2% voted “uncommitted” in this year’s Democratic primary in a protest against Biden’s policy towards Israel.

“In the conversations that we have had I have found her to be sympathetic and empathetic,” he said. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty Images

Before the meeting, Netanyahu said he believed military pressure on Hamas had created “movement” in ceasefire talks, and that he would send a team to an upcoming round of negotiations in Rome."

Trump calls Harris remarks on Israel 'disrespectful' in meeting with Netanyahu

Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will send a delegation to Rome for talks aimed at ending Israel's war with Hamas, but took aim at comments by Kamala Harris that she would "not be silent" about the "tragedy" in Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister's comments came on Friday during a visit to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a day after he discussed ceasefire efforts with US President Joe Biden and Ms Harris, the vice-president, in Washington.

The Biden administration said Israel and the US were closing "gaps" on the issue. Ms Harris, the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate, however, said that she would "not be silent" on the "tragedy" and the "suffering" of Gazan civilians as she called for all parties to reach an agreement.

"It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination," Ms Harris said.

After his meeting with Trump, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel would send negotiators "probably at the beginning of the week" to talks in Rome.

He said that there was "some movement" on ceasefire efforts "because of the military pressure we exerted".

However, he said that "I think to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no daylight between Israel and the United States, that it expedites the deal," he said. The talks are scheduled to begin on Sunday.

They will discuss a deal to end hostilities and return hostages still held in Gaza.

Trump said on Friday that he would commit to seeking peace if re-elected, and attacked Ms Harris's comments the day before as "disrespectful" to Israel.

He said that his own relationship with Mr Netanyahu was "always good. The proposal was immediately rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

* * * Many remain in Gaza.

The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 people have been killed in Israel's military response in Gaza.

The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu and several Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. No president has done what I've done for Israel and we've always had a very good relationship."

Trump's administration upended several longstanding US policies on the Middle East and Israel.

It announced plans to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that enraged Palestinians and their allies, who said it endangered the long-held goal of making occupied East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state.

The administration also withdrew from an international deal with Iran aimed at halting its nuclear weapons programme - a move backed by Israel but criticised by European states.

It developed the "Abraham accords", which sought to normalise relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.

And it offered a "Trump peace plan" that would have unified Jerusalem as Israel's capital and given it sovereignty over many parts of the occupied West Bank. "And I hope that those \[Harris's\] comments don't change that."

Hamas invaded southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, and taking 251 people hostage."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)) reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, discussing a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal <image:4075>. Newsweek ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)) reported that Trump allegedly called Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal, but Trump and Netanyahu's office denied the call. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff reported that Trump urged Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help the Harris campaign <image:4080>.

NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/g-s1-16958/gaza-ceasefire-talks-israel-hamas)) published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the Gaza cease-fire talks <image:4091>, <image:4092>, <image:4093>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)). However, the evidence also shows conflicting reports. Newsweek reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu's offices denied the call ([Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)).

The claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign is supported by a report from PBS host Judy Woodruff, as cited in the Newsweek article. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu's offices casts doubt on the claim's veracity.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to conflicting reports and denials. Further verification would require confirmation of the phone call and the specific content of the conversation.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:4143>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep. Pingback: [James Baldwin on Black-Jewish Relations, Israel and the United States – Tony Greenstein demo](https://demo.tonygreenstein.com/james-baldwin-on-black-jewish-relations-israel-and-the-united-states/)
    
8. 

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

But as fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah has intensified – with civilian casualties mounting, especially in Beirut and southern Lebanon – teams with the U.S. citizens assistance](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/crisis-intake)

• Connecting with commercially available flights running through Middle East Airlines, the primary carrier out of Lebanon.

• Putting on some extra flights to ensure greater seating capacity for U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who’d like to depart.

• Offering short-term emergency loans for those who want to stay in the country but move to a safer area.

“Our whole goal here throughout the entire event is to get American citizens from a place of danger to a place of safety,” Kerwin said.

U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

As Israeli bombardments targeting senior Hezbollah leaders shook southern neighborhoods in Lebanon's capital last week, “We could still see, hear and feel everything” despite fleeing to the mountains outside Beirut, said Nicolette Hutcherson, a longtime humanitarian volunteer living in Lebanon with her husband and three children.

The only seats Hutcherson's family could find on commercial carriers were for flights weeks away and for thousands of dollars, she said. Family members said he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

“He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,” she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising them to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said relatives who are U.S. Limits on withdrawing money from banks due to [Lebanon’s longstanding economic collapse](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-war-economy-d5433642fcfce79facf8a1369b14d0f0)
 and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult, they said.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

“She was on her way to the airport” when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said.

By Thursday, some Americans said their loved ones had been able to secure tickets for upcoming flights and were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon’s flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

New immigrants arrive in Israel after a Nefesh B'Nefesh charter flight, August 20, 2025 (Zev Stub/Times of Israel)

Josh and Naavah Gottesman of Bergenfield, New Jersey, had dreamed of moving to Israel for years, but were never ready to actually make the move. “We felt like, ‘How could we not be with our people?’ It pushed us to clarify our plans and make it a reality.”

The Gottesmans and their kids were among the 225 new immigrants who arrived in Israel on Wednesday with Nefesh B’Nefesh (NBN), on the organization’s first group charter flight from North America since the war started over 22 months ago.

They are also part of a growing trend, with immigration numbers surging this summer despite the challenges of Israel’s ongoing wars and diplomatic struggles.

In fact, August is set to be NBN’s busiest month in its 23-year history, with more than 1,000 new immigrants expected to arrive.

“In most countries, people leave during a war, but in Israel, people come to provide strength,” Immigration and Absorption Minister Ofir Sofer told The Times of Israel aboard the aliyah flight. “It says a lot about our solidarity and resilience that these families decided that now was the time to take this difficult decision to come to Israel.”

Nefesh B’Nefesh helps Jews from North America and the UK navigate the often challenging process of immigration to Israel, offering support with everything from paperwork and housing to employment and social integration.

Immigration is on the rise from the United States, France, Great Britain, Canada and other Western countries, Sofer said. While total immigration numbers dropped by 30% in 2024, according to Immigration and Absorption Ministry data, most of that decline was due to a drop in interest from Russia and Ukraine, where more than half of all new immigrants come from. Aliyah from those countries spiked shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022, but has since dropped off.

Elsewhere in the world, Sofer argued, Jews are watching Israel’s successes and sacrifices on the battlefield and deciding that they can no longer sit passively on the sidelines. Since the beginning of the year, the organization has so far brought over a total of 2,358 immigrants, compared to 1,950 in the same period in 2024 and 1,845 in the first eight months of 2023.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon amid escalating tensions with Hezbollah, as reported by [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) and [KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region/). Additionally, the U.S. has arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel since October 2023, as stated by the [Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/) and [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/state-dept-starts-exit-flights-israel-trump-mulls-war-entry-2088832).

The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. While the U.S. has arranged flights for *U.S. citizens* out of Israel, the evidence does not specify the nationality of those on the flights.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not verified.

Content: "As of January 2025, Israel had destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries over the course of the Gaza war.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

The destruction of cultural heritage during the [Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
 has included the damage and destruction by Israel of hundreds of culturally or historically significant buildings, libraries, museums, and other repositories of knowledge in [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")
, alongside the destruction of [intangible cultural heritage](/wiki/Intangible_cultural_heritage "Intangible cultural heritage")
.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-acgwo-3)
 Nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million people displaced.[\[4\]](#cite_note-UG-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-HM-5)

There are hundreds of cultural heritage sites in Gaza, including more than 300 architectural heritage sites. The philosopher [Jeff Malpas](/wiki/Jeff_Malpas "Jeff Malpas")
 highlights the use of destruction to exert authority and control over other groups as a significant issue in Israel–Palestine relations.[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

Cultural sites are protected under Article 53 of [Protocol I](/wiki/Protocol_I "Protocol I")
 of the [Geneva Conventions](/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions")
, and the intentional destruction of historic monument or buildings is considered a [war crime](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")

 requires that states "\[refrain\] from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility, directed against such property".[\[25\]](#cite_note-GU-25)
 Previous conflicts between Gaza and Israel have affected the Gaza Strip's cultural heritage sites; this includes the [2008–09 war](/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009) "Gaza War (2008–2009)")
 which resulted in damage to Gaza's libraries and what was then its only museum,[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

Impact
------

### Overview

On 7 October 2023, [Hamas attacked Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
, killing more than a thousand people (including more than 800 civilians) and taking some 251 hostages.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)
 In response Israel began a counterattack on Gaza; its initial focus was on the northern Gaza Strip, and bombing intensified towards the end of 2023 and expanded to the south with ground invasions to the extent that more half of the buildings in the Strip had been damaged or destroyed by January 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 [More than 46,600 Palestinians had been killed](/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war "Casualties of the Gaza war")
 by the time of a ceasefire in January 2025, with the majority consisting of women and children, and there was extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Israel's bombing campaign is one of the most destructive in recent history,[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 and nearly 80% of the buildings in the Gaza Strip were damaged or destroyed during the conflict by July 2025. In February 2024, they reported that 44 people involved with arts and culture were killed and around 200 historic buildings were damaged or destroyed, along with 12 museums and numerous cultural centres.[\[35\]](#cite_note-moc-35)
 [Intangible cultural heritage](/wiki/Intangible_cultural_heritage "Intangible cultural heritage")
 has also been affected through the loss of centres that provided community activities and supported Gazan culture.[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)
 In January 2025, shortly after the ceasefire, the Ministry of Culture began a process of evaluating the impact on the ground.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)
 [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO")
 has an ongoing damage assessment. A recent report by the Palestinian culture ministry into Israeli damage to Palestinian heritage said Israel's bombardment of Gaza had destroyed 207 buildings of cultural or historical significance, including 144 in the old city and 25 religious sites.

A mounting humanitarian crisis
------------------------------

The UN estimates that approximately 92 per cent of all residential buildings in Gaza – around 436,000 homes – have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The resulting debris amounts to nearly 50 million tonnes – an overwhelming quantity of rubble that would take decades to remove under current conditions.

Humanitarian organizations warn that the delay in debris removal and body recovery is not only deepening psychological trauma across Gaza but also threatens to become a public health and environmental catastrophe.

Gaza: Destruction of vital lifting gear halts search for thousands buried under rubble
======================================================================================

22 April 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Families in Gaza were holding on to the slim chance of finding loved ones buried under the ruins of destroyed homes – but that hope is fading fast.

The destruction of key heavy machinery on Tuesday following reported Israeli airstrikes has brought rescue and recovery efforts to a standstill, making it even harder to reach the estimated 11,000 bodies still trapped under the debris.

According to local authorities, the strikes put a halt to all solid waste and debris removal operations, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at a briefing in New York.

Until recently, bulldozers and other excavation equipment had been used in painstaking efforts to recover bodies from the wreckage.

One bulldozer operated by Atif Nasr – who before the war worked building and repairing roads – had become vital in the grim task of extracting the remains of loved ones from the rubble.

He was interviewed by a _UN News_ correspondent in Gaza before the strike but now his grim but vital work has come to a standstill after his vehicle was destroyed.

![Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.](https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production%20Library/22-04-2025-UN-News-Gaza.bmp/image3000x3000.jpg "Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.")

UN News

Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.

Months trapped in rubble
------------------------

The Dahdouh family managed to recover the remains of their son, Omar, from the ruins of their home, almost a year after he was killed in an airstrike which levelled their seven-story building.

Standing at the site, Omar’s brother, Moayad, shared the family’s ordeal.

“His body remained trapped under the rubble for nearly a year. After the war, we tried to retrieve him, but with the building so large and with no heavy machinery available, it was impossible.

“We searched everywhere for a bulldozer to reach the ground floor – where Omar had been – but during the war, Israeli forces destroyed or burned all the bulldozers or excavators that could have helped us.”

A decent burial
---------------

In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, the Dajani family continues to live in what’s left of their destroyed home, where the bodies of three of their children remain buried.

Their father Ali remembers the time they died with a heavy heart.

“We fled to the beach area during the bombings."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that a significant portion of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed. The Wikipedia article states that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and the UN News article reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The claim states that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. The evidence supports the claim that there was significant destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image is from December 2024.

I need more information to verify the date of the image.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, stating that nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. The article also mentions that Israel destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries as of January 2025. The article does not contain the image.

A UN News article from April 2025 reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. The article includes an image of a bulldozer removing rubble in Gaza City. The Bloomberg article contains no information.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that a significant portion of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed. The Wikipedia article states that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and the UN News article reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The claim states that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. The evidence supports the claim that there was significant destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image is from December 2024.

I need more information to verify the date of the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:33>)
web_search("Gaza destroyed buildings")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, stating that nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. The article also mentions that Israel destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries as of January 2025. The article does not contain the image.

A UN News article from April 2025 reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. The article includes an image of a bulldozer removing rubble in Gaza City. The Bloomberg article contains no information.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that a significant portion of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed. The Wikipedia article states that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and the UN News article reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The claim states that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. The evidence supports the claim that there was significant destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image is from December 2024.

I need more information to verify the date of the image.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image showing the destruction of Gaza (<image:4232>). NPR published an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:4233>). Al Jazeera published an article with aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:4235>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was significant destruction in Gaza. The image search provides additional images of destroyed buildings in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the date of the image. The geolocation suggests the image was most likely taken in Jordan.

I still need more information to verify the date of the image.

A timeline of the Gaza Strip in modern history
==============================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Feb 5, 2025 3:54 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Gaza has long been a powder keg, and it exploded after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on Oct. President Donald Trump’s suggestion Tuesday that [displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-wants-egypt-and-jordan-to-let-in-palestinian-refugees-from-gaza-heres-why-the-idea-is-rejected)
 outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take “ownership” of the land is triggering new tensions over the future of the enclave.

[**WATCH:** Trump suggests permanent resettling Palestinians outside of Gaza, sees U.S. ‘ownership’ of area](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-trump-and-israels-netanyahu-hold-first-joint-news-briefing-of-second-administration)

While “owning” land is a term that appears to be more applicable to real estate than to territories, the Palestinians see the Gaza Strip as an integral part of their future state, even if the rulers have changed over decades. Palestinian statehood on land that would include the Gaza Strip has broad international support.

Here’s a look at the troubled modern history of the Gaza Strip:

1948 – 1967: Egyptian rule of Gaza
----------------------------------

Before the war surrounding Israel’s establishment in 1948, present-day Gaza was part of the large swath of the Middle East under British colonial rule. After Israel defeated the coalition of Arab states, the Egyptian army was left in control of a small strip of land wedged between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean.

During the war, some 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes in what is now Israel — a mass uprooting that they call the [Nakba](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinians-mark-the-nakba-the-original-catastrophe-of-mass-expulsion)
, or “catastrophe.” Tens of thousands of Palestinians flocked to the strip.

Under Egyptian military control, Palestinian refugees in Gaza were stuck, homeless and stateless. Many were supported by UNWRA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, which has a heavy presence in Gaza to this day. Meanwhile, some young Palestinians became “fedayeen” — insurgency fighters who conducted raids into Israel.

1967 – 1993: Israel seizes control
----------------------------------

Israel seized control of Gaza from Egypt during the 1967 Mideast war, when it also captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem — areas that remain under Israeli control. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers semi-autonomous areas of the occupied West Bank, seeks all three areas for a hoped-for future state.

Israel built more than 20 Jewish [settlements](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-finance-minister-calls-for-reestablishing-israeli-settlements-in-gaza)
 in Gaza during this period. President Jimmy Carter.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi has referenced this 40-year old treaty when he declined to permit Palestinian refugees from Gaza into Egypt, saying the potential entrance of militants into Egypt would threaten longstanding peace between Israel and Egypt.

The first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation erupted in Gaza in December 1987, kicking off more than five years of sustained protests and bloody violence."

2018 marks 51 years since the occupation of the Palestinian Territory and 11 years of the Gaza blockade. Both the occupation and the blockade affect every aspect of life for Palestinians – they dictate where they can live and study, and whom they can marry.

The blockade has devastated Gaza’s economy, caused widespread destruction and left most people largely cut off from the outside world. Check the timeline:

Israel’s blockade of Gaza keeps people poor and denies them their rights. We are calling on all parties to the conflict to not allow another escalation in violence, to agree to a lasting ceasefire and an urgent end to the blockade.

* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:33>)
web_search("Gaza destroyed buildings")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, stating that nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. The article also mentions that Israel destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries as of January 2025. The article does not contain the image.

A UN News article from April 2025 reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. The article includes an image of a bulldozer removing rubble in Gaza City. The Bloomberg article contains no information.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that a significant portion of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed. The Wikipedia article states that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and the UN News article reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The claim states that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. The evidence supports the claim that there was significant destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image is from December 2024.

I need more information to verify the date of the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image showing the destruction of Gaza (<image:4232>). NPR published an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:4233>). Al Jazeera published an article with aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:4235>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was significant destruction in Gaza. The image search provides additional images of destroyed buildings in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the date of the image. The geolocation suggests the image was most likely taken in Jordan.

I still need more information to verify the date of the image.

**Ramallah, December 18, 2023—**Israeli forces killed a 12-year-old Palestinian girl in an attack targeting a hospital yesterday in the southern Gaza Strip. 

12-year-old Dunia Abu Mohsen was recovering from losing her leg in an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and siblings in Naser Hospital in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, when an Israeli tank-fired shell [hit the hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/12/18/israel-hamas-war-live-israeli-strikes-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-kill-90?update=2565152)
 and struck her in the head the evening of December 17. The tank shell, which did not explode, injured several other Palestinians. 

Dunia lost her leg in an Israeli airstrike on October 27 that struck her relatives’ home in the Al-Amal neighborhood of Khan Younis, according to the [Palestinian Center for Human Rights](https://pchrgaza.org/ar/%D8%B6%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA-3-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A/)
. 12-year-old Dunia Abu Mohsen was killed by an Israeli tank-fired shell that struck Naser Hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on December 17. “I only want one thing: For the war to end.”

More than 7,870 Palestinian children have been killed by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip since October 7, according to the Governmental Media Office. The death toll is rising rapidly as Israeli authorities cut Palestinians in Gaza off from food, clean water, fuel, electricity, and vital medicines. 

Israeli forces have systematically targeted Gaza’s health system since launching a massive military offensive on October 7, depriving hospitals of fuel, electricity, and medicines and targeting many hospitals with airstrikes, shelling, live ammunition, and other attacks on patients and health care workers. Only eight of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are currently functional and services are extremely limited, according to [UN OCHA](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-71)
.

Israeli forces besieged Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza for four days, withdrawing on December 16, during which Israeli forces detained around 90 Palestinians and destroyed several parts of the hospital. Israeli military bulldozers crushed around 20 displaced Palestinians seeking shelter in tents in the hospital courtyard, according to [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/pa-health-minister-seeks-probe-into-deadly-israeli-raid-on-gaza-hospital)
.

Under international law, genocide is prohibited and constitutes the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group, in whole or in part. Six of her family members were killed in the airstrike, including her parents and two of her siblings. 

“I want someone to take me abroad, to any country, to install a prosthetic leg, to be able to walk like other people,” Dunia told DCIP in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiFZROsyJDQ)
 that was filmed on November 25 during the seven-day truce agreement between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. 

“I want to become a doctor, like those who treat us, so that I can treat other children,” Dunia said. Deploying explosive weapons in densely-populated civilian areas constitutes indiscriminate attacks and carrying out direct attacks against civilians or civilian objects amounts to war crimes.

Israeli authorities have imposed a closure policy against the Gaza Strip since 2007 by strictly controlling and limiting the entry and exit of individuals; maintaining harsh restrictions on imports including food, construction materials, fuel, and other essential items; as well as prohibiting exports. <image:4242>](palestinian_children_disappear_while_seeking_aid_in_northern_gaza)

That evening, Iyas al-Akhras (19), a Hamas military wing operative, was killed in a fire exchange between Israeli forces and armed Palestinians in the al-Manshiyah neighborhood in the center of the camp. The operation, which initially focused on Jenin, was expanded on 27 January 2025 to include Tulkarm and Tulkarm R.C., and about a week and a half later, on 8 February 2025, Israeli forces also raided nearby Nur Shams R.C.

**The car that Yazan Abu Shu’lah was driving. Due to military activity in the camp, Palestinian emergency crews were not able to access the site for several hours. The Israeli forces entered the yard and attached explosives to the door leading into the living room. The next day, Israeli forces expelled all residents of the al-Madares neighborhood, where the Abu Shu’lah and al-Ashqar families live. Senior Israeli officials have said military activity in refugee camps in the northern West Bank is expected to last a year, and residents will not be permitted to return to their homes."

The Israeli military reinvaded Gaza City's Shejaiya neighbourhood on Thursday \[Getty\]

An Israeli tank ran over a [Palestinian](https://www.newarab.com/news/red-crescent-evacuates-khan-younis-hq-after-israeli-bombing)
 woman in front of her son in [Gaza City](https://www.newarab.com/news/fighting-rages-gaza-citys-shejaiya-fourth-day)
 on Thursday, according to a rights monitor.

According to Euro-Med Monitor, 65-year-old Safiya Hassan Musa Al-Jamal was run over by a tank after she was injured by [Israeli](https://www.newarab.com/news/israeli-attacking-areas-north-and-south-gaza-fighting-rages)
 forces who stormed her house.

Safiya's son, Muhannad Al-Jamal, witnessed the incident.

According to Muhannad, the incident started at 10 am when Israeli forces first began entering Shejaiya, with his mother, three sisters and niece being forced to the first floor to avoid shelling and gunfire.

After sunset, Israeli soldiers stormed the house, with Muhannad saying that they "started firing at the walls randomly and threw five bombs amid gunfire" that injured him and his mother.

Euro-Med Monitor also acquired testimony from his sister Areeji, who said that a female soldier provided aid to Safiya. After telling Muhannad she'd be taken to a hospital, a tank proceeded to run her over.

"When I saw the scene, I thought I had gone insane and began to cry and scream," Muhannad said, adding that he quickly fled after an eruption of gunfire.

[Euro-Med](https://www.newarab.com/news/israels-bombing-gaza-clinics-manifestation-genocide)
 noted in its report that it had documented other incidents where Israeli tanks had run over Palestinian civilians, including on 29 February when sixty-two-year-old Jamal Hamdi Hassan Ashour was run over in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City.

It also said it documented an incident on 23 January when an Israeli tank ran over members of the Ghannam family in Khan Younis.

_The New Arab_ has requested comment from the Israeli military on the incident, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Israel's war on Gaza has killed 37,877 people and [wounded](https://www.newarab.com/news/israels-war-gaza-leaves-around-10000-palestinians-disabled)
 a further 86,969 others, according to data from Gaza's health authorities.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include reports of Israeli tanks involved in incidents in Gaza. One source from Defense for Children International - Palestine (DCIP) reports that an Israeli tank-fired shell killed a 12-year-old Palestinian girl in Gaza in December 2023, and another from The New Arab reports that an Israeli tank ran over a Palestinian woman in Gaza City on June 30, 2024, including a photo of an Israeli tank (<image:i>). Another source from ReliefWeb discusses military operations in the occupied Palestinian territory in January and February 2025.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a pink hanger with hooks for drying clothes from Walmart ([https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629)) <image:4252> and a water tank with clothes drying in Sorong, Indonesia from Dreamstime ([https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856](https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856)) <image:4253>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's location is likely Palestine, and the web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. While the claim is plausible, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.

'What did he do wrong': Father carries lifeless body of his son, killed while seeking food aid

00:34

CNN  — 

Israeli troops opened fire on Gazans seeking [food aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/middleeast/us-israel-aid-gaza-looting-intl)
 in the territory, killing at least 32 people, the Palestinian health ministry and witnesses said.

The ministry said that the bodies had been brought to Nasser Medical Complex, along with dozens of injured people.

CNN video from the hospital showed lines of bodies. One eyewitness, Hisham Dargam, said it had occurred some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from an aid distribution point run by the [Gaza Humanitarian Foundation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/politics/us-consulting-group-terminates-contract-gaza-aid-group)
, the controversial Israeli- and US-backed organization.

“Gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks, as if they were in a battle with us,” he said.

The [Israeli military](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel)
 said troops had “identified suspects who approached them during operational activity in the Rafah area” about one kilometer from the aid site “at night-time when it’s not active.”

The Israel Defense Forces said troops fire warning shots and was investigating reports of casualties.

The GHF denied there were any incidents “at or near” any of its distribution sites on Saturday.

“The reported IDF activity resulting in fatalities occurred hours before our sites opened and our understanding is most of the casualties occurred several kilometers away from the nearest GHF site,” it said. ](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2225049800.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

A doctor at the Nasser hospital, Travis Melin, said that many of the victims Saturday had “severe” gunshot wounds to the torso and head.

[Hundreds of people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/middleeast/israel-gaza-aid-site-crush-deaths-intl)
 have been killed while trying to access aid in Gaza since the GHF – a private group - began operating in the Strip in May, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. “We’re going to have another ten coming very shortly, and we hope to have that finished pretty quickly, and (Middle East Envoy) Steve Witkoff has been fantastic, he’s done a great job in that.”

Despite Trump’s positive outlook, the two parties to the conflict are again blaming one another for another faltering round of ceasefire talks, releasing statements on Friday accusing the other of dragging their feet in negotiations.

Hamas warned that it “cannot guarantee” that it will agree to any pauses to the conflict in the future if Israel does not agree to work towards a full end to the war in the current round of talks.

In the past, Israel has not been keen to agree to any permanent ceasefire, stating that it wants to continue fighting in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is eradicated.

Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said that, if Israel does not comply with its demands, the militant group could also not guarantee that it would release 10 living hostages as a part of the ceasefire deal.

“It has become clear to us that (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu’s government is not genuinely concerned about the captives, simply because they are soldiers,” he continued.

An Israeli official told reporters that one key sticking point in the talks is Hamas’ refusal to discuss what negotiators have dubbed the “release key” - the criteria and ratio through which individuals are identified for release in a swap - until there is a finalized agreement on where Israel will position its troops.

Israel is willing to be flexible in talks, the source said, accusing Hamas of “foot-dragging.”

CNN’s Abeer Salman, Dana Karni and Donald Judd contributed to this report.

Ad Feedback The GHF added that it had repeatedly warned those seeking aid not to travel to its sites overnight or in early morning hours.

However, many Gazans have told CNN that they have to travel to distribution points several hours before they open to have a chance of receiving aid. Food in the strip is scarce, and people are starving, according to multiple UN assessments.

Most Gazans also have no means of transportation to travel to GHF centers, so have to walk long distances to reach the sites.

![Palestinians recite a prayer over a body at the Nasser hospital on July 19, 2025. Everyone else is going to these massacre sites… even though they know it comes with this incredible amount of danger,” he added.

The director of communications for UNRWA, the United Nations agency that provides relief to Palestinian refugees, told CNN that the current aid distribution system in Gaza is a “death trap for starving Palestinians” calling for the organization to again be allowed to lead aid efforts.

Faltering ceasefire talks
-------------------------

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump struck an optimistic note regarding ongoing [ceasefire talks](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/02/middleeast/israel-gaza-ceasefire-deal-closer-than-ever-what-we-know-intl)
 between Israel and Hamas.

“In Gaza, we got most of the [hostages](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/middleeast/former-hamas-hostage-or-levy-haunted-intl)
 back,” he said on Friday evening."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include reports of Israeli tanks involved in incidents in Gaza. One source from Defense for Children International - Palestine (DCIP) reports that an Israeli tank-fired shell killed a 12-year-old Palestinian girl in Gaza in December 2023, and another from The New Arab reports that an Israeli tank ran over a Palestinian woman in Gaza City on June 30, 2024, including a photo of an Israeli tank (<image:i>). Another source from ReliefWeb discusses military operations in the occupied Palestinian territory in January and February 2025.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a pink hanger with hooks for drying clothes from Walmart ([https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629)) <image:4252> and a water tank with clothes drying in Sorong, Indonesia from Dreamstime ([https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856](https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856)) <image:4253>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York Times published an article on December 30, 2023, updated on April 29, 2024, featuring images from the war in Gaza, including a mass grave (<image:4258>). The Associated Press (AP) provides photos of Israeli tanks and Palestinians fleeing, taken in October and November (<image:i>). A CNN article from July 19, 2025, reports on Israeli troops opening fire on Gazans seeking food aid. The article mentions the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context about the conflict in Gaza, including images of the war and its impact. However, it does not directly confirm the claim about the specific image of the tank and drying clothes. The search results mention Israeli tanks and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but they do not include the image in question.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the image's authenticity and the specific details provided.

Photographs of a young Palestinian child appearing to suffer from severe malnutrition have emerged over the past week as a new symbol of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where the war between Israel and the Palestinian [Hamas](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/hamas)
 movement is grinding on amid repeated failed ceasefire initiatives.

But the images have also set off a firestorm of controversy, with a number of sources arguing that one-and-a-half-year-old —photographed being cradled by his mother, Hidaya—also suffered from underlying conditions contributing to his emaciated state, and that his "[non-emaciated](https://x.com/KyleWOrton/status/1949826769382457540)
" brother was cropped out of the photos.

While few deny that Palestinians in Gaza are faced with dire and deteriorating living conditions, the debate is playing out as Israeli officials and supporters of Israel's war aims contend that reports of mass hunger in the besieged territory are exaggerated and deliberately engineered to fit a narrative backed by Hamas.

"There is no starvation in Gaza, no policy of starvation in Gaza, and I assure you that we have a commitment to achieve our war goals," Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu)
 declared on Sunday.

But as the [United Nations](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/united-nations)
 and international humanitarian organizations argue otherwise, one of the Israeli premier's closest allies, President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)
 also cast doubt on Netanyahu's claim when asked by a reporter if he agreed with it.

"I don't know. They were quickly featured on a number of international outlets, including [BBC](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bbc)
, [CNN](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn)
, _The Guardian_, [NBC](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nbc)
 News, _The New York Times_ and _The Washington Post_.

Most coverage included Matouq's image to reinforce reporting about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with many including additional visuals and sources, such as local and international aid workers. Yet the majority of the articles did not reference that Matouq also suffered from other ailments, as alleged by investigative journalist David Collier, who is supportive of Israel's war efforts.

In a series of X posts, Collier accused mainstream media outlets on Sunday of manipulating Matouq's plight without highlighting that he had cerebral palsy, hypoxia and a "serious genetic disorder," citing what he said was a May 2025 medical report issued in Gaza.

"You exploited the image of a child with cerebral palsy to push a lie about famine," Collier wrote in a follow-up post Monday directed toward several major outlets who featured Matouq's image. "He needs specialised formula and medication."

!gaza photo hunger <image:4305>

Photographs of Mohammed al-Matouq were printed on the front pages of newspapers around the world. "He is not simply a victim of starvation, and the image has been presented in a misleading and incomplete way."

Getty Images, which hosts several photos of Matouq and his mother taken by a photographer from the Turkish news agency Anadolu, described the child as "sick" and "also displaying signs of malnutrition" in accompanying captions.

A _Newsweek_ search of Getty's database found [numerous](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rahil-mohammed-rasras-a-32-year-old-palestinian-woman-news-photo/2225467851?adppopup=true)

 of other Palestinians, both children and adults, also displaying signs of malnutrition in recent imagery taken from Gaza.

She testified that colleagues in Gaza had spoken with mothers "who are watching their babies waste away in front of them, and medics who are despairing about their inability to save them." She said UNICEF has also conducted interviews with children "who were injured in the desperate search for food, or watched a parent be killed in front of them while trying to get a little bit of aid."

"This crisis is manmade and entirely preventable," Ingram said."

    Thomas Hand and Natali Hand hold an image of Emily at the Dublin news conference
    
    The Irish father and sister of eight-year-old Emily Hand, who is believed to be held hostage since she was taken by Hamas on 7 October, tell a Dublin news conference of their distress at her disappearance.
    
    Thomas Hand, originally from Dun Laoghaire, travelled to Dublin with Natalie "to drum up as much sympathy and support" for hostages taken to Gaza.
    
    He describes his daughter Emily as a "fun-loving child", adding that “even my dog misses her”.
    
    “And now she's kidnapped in Gaza along with many others,” he adds.
    
    Emily’s sister Natali was in Australia when Hamas attacked southern Israel. Summary

    Over a week ago, a US official [said UNRWA was able to access existing reserves in the territory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-middle-east-67305304?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=65461a831ec331355f96164f%26US%20official%20says%20there%20is%20an%20agreed%20mechanism%20to%20bring%20more%20fuel%20into%20Gaza%262023-11-04T12%3A10%3A30.947Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:142b0677-9933-41aa-9937-e6c97dd522df&pinned_post_asset_id=65461a831ec331355f96164f&pinned_post_type=share)
    , and that there was an "agreed mechanism" for when this fuel ran out.
    
    According to Reuters, Lazzarini said the UN agency had been slowly emptying a fuel depot on the Gaza-Israel border and a request to the Israeli military to replenish it had gone unanswered.

    The vessel brought generators, ambulances and other medical supplies to the port of Al Arish, with the aim of establishing eight field hospitals, according to AFP.
    
    It is the first such aid vessel to arrive in Egypt since war broke out on 7 October when Hamas launched a series of attacks on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage.
    
    The World Health Organization says Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City "is not functioning as a hospital anymore". A [statement , external](https://twitter.com/FaudaOfficial/status/1723415708795621526)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:36>)
web_search("Israeli tank Palestinian woman Gaza")
image_search("tank drying clothes")
reverse_search(<image:36>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include reports of Israeli tanks involved in incidents in Gaza. One source from Defense for Children International - Palestine (DCIP) reports that an Israeli tank-fired shell killed a 12-year-old Palestinian girl in Gaza in December 2023, and another from The New Arab reports that an Israeli tank ran over a Palestinian woman in Gaza City on June 30, 2024, including a photo of an Israeli tank (<image:i>). Another source from ReliefWeb discusses military operations in the occupied Palestinian territory in January and February 2025.

The DCIP article can be found here: [https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_tank_fired_shell_kills_palestinian_girl_in_gaza_hospital](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_tank_fired_shell_kills_palestinian_girl_in_gaza_hospital).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a pink hanger with hooks for drying clothes from Walmart ([https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tank-Hanger-Hanging-Drying-Rack-hook-Hanger-Multi-Hook-Coat-hanger-Tie-Hanger-Belt-Vest-Rack-Socks-Gloves-Windproof-Towels-Baby-Clothes-Sock-Pink/5037221629)) <image:4252> and a water tank with clothes drying in Sorong, Indonesia from Dreamstime ([https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856](https://www.dreamstime.com/water-tank-clothes-drying-sun-west-papua-sorong-indonesia-oct-painted-green-one-streets-covered-spread-image228839856)) <image:4253>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli tank Gaza drying clothes image")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York Times published an article on December 30, 2023, updated on April 29, 2024, featuring images from the war in Gaza, including a mass grave (<image:4258>). The Associated Press (AP) provides photos of Israeli tanks and Palestinians fleeing, taken in October and November (<image:i>). A CNN article from July 19, 2025, reports on Israeli troops opening fire on Gazans seeking food aid. The article mentions the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context about the conflict in Gaza, including images of the war and its impact. However, it does not directly confirm the claim about the specific image of the tank and drying clothes. The search results mention Israeli tanks and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but they do not include the image in question.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the image's authenticity and the specific details provided.

The Viral Atrocities Posted by Israeli Soldiers
===============================================

Tracing 75 years of Israeli war photography, an anthropologist explains how images that reframe disproportionate violence as proof of victory have intensified in the war on Gaza that erupted in 2023.

By [Sophia Goodfriend](https://www.sapiens.org/authors/sophia-goodfriend/)

20 Mar 2024

!A header image on a cellphone of several people wearing military uniforms and holding hands is above a yellow logo and white text that reads, “Israel Defense Forces.” White text underneath reads, “Official IDF Twitter account. We tweet real-time information and updates in 7 languages—choose yours.” <image:4410>

> _Content Warning: The materials below include images of violence._

✽

In early January, a [TikTok account](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/zAdvXhtCIik)
 affiliated with Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas party posted a video that an Israeli soldier filmed in Gaza. The scenes narrated the atrocities of 1948, [in the words of Azoulay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670045)
, “as a series of unproblematic, quasi-natural events and justified as side effects of the state-building project.”

Anthropologist [Rebecca Stein](https://rebeccalstein.com/)
 notes in the _International Journal of Middle East Studies_ that [similar images](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40206012)
 circulated immediately after the 1967 Six-Day war, when Israeli troops occupied the West Bank, annexing East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, among other regions. Staged after the blood had been cleared and the bodies carted off, the images, Stein writes, “served to stabilize and banalize” the military operations they represented.

Soldiers deployed into the heart of the Gaza Strip since last October are updating this historical archive. Others report that algorithmically determined news feeds have prevented many Israelis from seeing images of Palestinian suffering.

But to say, “If only Israelis could see what is happening in Gaza, they would demand an end to the violence” ignores the political reality and majority. But the sentiment may be more popular than ever: According to a survey by the Jerusalem-based think tank the Israel Democracy Institute, as of December 2023, [75 percent of Jewish Israelis](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-02/ty-article/75-of-jewish-israelis-reject-u-s-demand-to-shift-gaza-war-to-new-phase-poll-finds/0000018c-caa4-d4e1-ad8f-feb5bdda0000)
 opposed agreeing to the U.S. Her public writing on automated warfare and digital rights in the region can be found in _Foreign Policy_, _The Baffler_, _Jewish Currents_, _+972 Magazine_, and the _London Review of Books_, among other outlets.

The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, with a 29% probability. The web search confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search shows examples of drying clothes, but not on tanks. The claim's assertion of a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza is plausible, given the context of Israeli military presence in Gaza. However, the exact date of July 2024 cannot be verified.

The evidence does not directly confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date. More information is needed to verify the exact date and confirm the image's origin.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York Times published an article on December 30, 2023, updated on April 29, 2024, featuring images from the war in Gaza, including a mass grave (<image:4258>). The Associated Press (AP) provides photos of Israeli tanks and Palestinians fleeing, taken in October and November (<image:i>). A CNN article from July 19, 2025, reports on Israeli troops opening fire on Gazans seeking food aid. The article mentions the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context about the conflict in Gaza, including images of the war and its impact. However, it does not directly confirm the claim about the specific image of the tank and drying clothes. The search results mention Israeli tanks and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but they do not include the image in question.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the image's authenticity and the specific details provided.

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”

Israel operates a range of defensive systems to block attacks by everything from ballistic missiles with trajectories that take them above the atmosphere to low-flying cruise missiles and rockets.

The country’s **Iron Dome system** has been in the headlines often since regional hostilities ramped up last year in the wake of Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel and the Israeli military’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

Israel has vowed to respond to Iran’s largest ever attack on the country, fueling fears of a further escalation of conflict in the Middle East.

Iran launched dozens of missiles toward Israel on Tuesday in what Tehran said was a response to the [killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/middleeast/hezbollah-nasrallah-killed-israel-strikes-intl/index.html)
 and others, just hours after Israel said it had launched a [“limited and localized” ground operation](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/middleeast/israel-ground-incursion-lebanon-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html)
 against the Iran-backed group in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated that Iran fired 180 “projectiles” at the country. We will act at the time and place we decide,” he said.

CNN teams in Beirut heard blasts overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.

Thick plumes of smoke were visible in the sky above the capital’s southern suburbs, a CNN photo shows.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) earlier said it is striking Hezbollah targets in several southern suburbs of Beirut and more details of the operation would follow.

It also told residents to evacuate several neighborhoods and buildings in the southern suburbs, where it suggested strikes are planned.

In one of a few messages posted to X after midnight local time, IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned that residents are located near “dangerous facilities belonging to Hezbollah against which the Defense Force will act with strength shortly.”

Evacuation orders from the Israeli military have been posted on social media between midnight local time and 3 a.m., likely when many people are sleeping.

An estimated 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced over the past couple of weeks, thousands of them sheltering in Beirut, including in schools on the edges of the southern suburbs of the city.

Israeli authorities were picking through pieces of shrapnel to identify the type of missile used in the aftermath of an attack carried out by Iran on Tuesday.

CNN’s Jeremy Diamond, reporting from the site of an attack near a school in the central Israeli town of Gedera, said the impact of the strike left a wall and the windows of a second-grade classroom shattered, with significant damage seen inside.

Workers and heavy machinery could be seen in the background clearing through debris around a large crater measuring around 8 feet at its deepest portion. Shrapnel pieces could also be seen laid out as they were collected for further analysis.

No casualties were reported but hours before the attack, children had been attending the school.

Remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile, including the guidance section and the warhead, were visible in the images and videos taken by CNN at the site of the crater, according to Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army.

He said it was difficult to identify the exact model due to the lack of reference images.

Iranian missile appears to hit less than a kilometer from Mossad headquarters in Herzliya, Israel, on October 1, 2024, in videos verified by CNN.

Social media

Of the approximately 180 missiles the Israel Defense Forces say Iran fired Tuesday night, at least three apparent targets have emerged from a CNN analysis of geolocated videos of the attack.

It’s still too early to tell whether the attack resulted in any serious damage – that will require daylight and likely satellite imagery – but by analyzing the videos from the attack we have a picture of what Iran targeted.

Footage shows a significant concentration of missiles fell either at, or near, the headquarters of Mossad, Nevatim Air Base and Tel Nof Air Base.

Those locations largely tally with what the US intelligence community, and the Israelis, believed would be targeted. The facility, one of Israel’s largest, was previously hit by Iran during its April 13 attack (the IDF said the damage was minimal.)

In the area of the Tel Nof base, more than 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, another video showed a number of impacts.

This screengrab from a video shows a missile fragment in Balqa, Jordan on October 2, 2024.

Al Mamlaka TV

Jordan has vowed it “will not be a battleground for anyone,” after an Iranian missile attack on Israel ramped up tensions across the Middle East and compounded fears of a wider conflict.

The Ministry of Interior said missile fragments had fallen in different parts of the country including the capital Amman.

Three people sustained minor injuries from falling missiles and debris, according to al-Momani. The Arrow 2 has a range of 56 miles and a maximum altitude of 32 miles, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which called the system an upgrade of the US Patriot missile defenses Israel once used in this role.

Meanwhile, the **Arrow 3** uses hit-to-kill technology to intercept incoming ballistic missiles in space, before they reenter the atmosphere on their way to targets.

The Iron Dome was mentioned as part of Israel's defensive systems. <image:1>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of the Israeli defense systems. While Israel claimed to have shot down most missiles, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the ballistic missiles is not directly supported. Iran claimed that 90% of the missiles hit their targets.

The provided sources mention the Iron Dome as part of Israel's defense, but they do not specify the system's interception rate.

To verify the claim, I would need specific data on the Iron Dome's performance during the October 1, 2024, attack, including the number of missiles intercepted.

The web sources discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel, involving approximately 180-200 ballistic missiles.  Israel claimed to have shot down most of the missiles, while Iran stated that 90% hit their targets. The attacks caused minor damage, with some injuries and fatalities.  The sources include reports from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk)). The Iron Dome was mentioned as part of Israel's defensive systems. <image:1>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of the Israeli defense systems. While Israel claimed to have shot down most missiles, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the ballistic missiles is not directly supported. Iran claimed that 90% of the missiles hit their targets.

The provided sources mention the Iron Dome as part of Israel's defense, but they do not specify the system's interception rate.

To verify the claim, I would need specific data on the Iron Dome's performance during the October 1, 2024, attack, including the number of missiles intercepted.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel, mentioning the Iron Dome as part of Israel's defense systems.

Israel claimed to have shot down most of the missiles, while Iran stated that 90% hit their targets. The attacks caused minor damage, with some injuries and fatalities.  The sources include reports from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk)). The Iron Dome was mentioned as part of Israel's defensive systems. <image:1>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of the Israeli defense systems. While Israel claimed to have shot down most missiles, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the ballistic missiles is not directly supported. Iran claimed that 90% of the missiles hit their targets.

The provided sources mention the Iron Dome as part of Israel's defense, but they do not specify the system's interception rate.

To verify the claim, I would need specific data on the Iron Dome's performance during the October 1, 2024, attack, including the number of missiles intercepted.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals conflicting information about the success of Israel's defense systems during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack. While the Iron Dome is mentioned as part of the defense, the provided sources do not specify its interception rate. The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the ballistic missiles is not directly supported by the evidence.

The decision option that applies best is `not enough information` because the fact-check lacks specific data on the Iron Dome's performance during the October 1, 2024, attack, including the number of missiles intercepted. `not enough information`

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.

 [Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/associated-press) The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas.

It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

Content: "JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 1 NatSec Brief: December 6, 2024 October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime Ari Cicurel Assistant Director of Foreign Policy Yoni Tobin Policy Analyst Iran has threatened another strike against Israel in recent days. That changed with Iran’s October 1 missile attack against Israel, which cost Tehran relatively more to execute than it cost Israel and the United States to defend against, while yielding minimal tactical or strategic success for the regime. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 3 » Assuming Iran fired 180 missiles and used similar missile variants in the attack, Israel’s figures demonstrate that Iran’s medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) cost the regime at least $12 million apiece—far costlier than previous public estimates. Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack cost the regime around $2.3 billion, at least four and six times the estimated cost (and at least 124 and 42 times more in terms of GDP per capita) for the United States and Israel, respectively, to defend against it. According to a Tasnim sum- mary of his remarks, Larijani said, “relevant officials \[in Iran’s\] military and government are preparing measures to show \[a\] proper response to recent Israeli aggression against Iran.” » Iran’s previous direct attack against Israel—its October 1 missile strike—inflicted minimal damage despite Iran launching approximately 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli airspace. » To defend itself against this incessant barrage, Israel has relied on its Iron Dome system, which—while greatly effective at an interception rate of roughly 90 percent—has accrued high costs. ⚫ On November 12, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Iran’s October 1 missile attack cost the Iranian regime $2.3 billion. Costs of October 1 Missile Attack Israel United States Iran Low-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $360,000,000 $116,400,000 $2,300,000,000 (Number provided by Israel) High-End Estimated Cost of Missile Attack $630,000,000 $334,000,000 GDP Per Capita (2023 est.) World Bank Figures $52,260 $81,695 $4,502 ⚫ Given that around 180 missiles entered Israeli airspace in the attack, the maximum conceiv- able cost for Israel to defend against Iran’s October 1 attack—assuming a ratio of one inter- ceptor fired per inbound missile—was significant but smaller than Iran’s: between $360 mil- lion and $630 million, according to JINSA estimates. ⚫ The regional war of attrition started by Hamas’s October 7 attack has put Israel and the United States on the wrong side of the cost-curve defending against aerial attacks by con- ventionally weaker Iranian proxies. JINSA October Missile Attack Proves Costly for Iranian Regime 2 In addition, the attack proved costly in tactical terms for Iran, yielding serious IDF blowback that compromised key elements of the regime’s nuclear programs and ballistic missile pro- duction programs, and took out the regime’s top air defenses."

# Your Summary

JINSA (December 6, 2024) states that the Iron Dome had an interception rate of roughly 90 percent during the October 1 missile attack. The source also mentions that Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles.

The web sources discuss the Iron Dome missile defense system and its role in Israel's air defense. One source from AP News ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3](https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3)) provides an image showing the range of the Iron Dome, designed to intercept short-range missiles. <image:4500> Another source from Euronews ([https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) also discusses the Iron Dome. <image:4502> However, none of the sources provide specific data on the Iron Dome's interception rate during the October 1, 2024, attack.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the Iron Dome is mentioned as part of Israel's defense system, the provided sources do not specify its interception rate during the October 1, 2024, attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

## Actions
```
web_search("Iron Dome Israel Iran attack October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel, involving approximately 180-200 ballistic missiles.  Israel claimed to have shot down most of the missiles, while Iran stated that 90% hit their targets. The attacks caused minor damage, with some injuries and fatalities.  The sources include reports from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-war-hezbollah-10-1-24-intl-hnk)). The Iron Dome was mentioned as part of Israel's defensive systems. <image:1>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting claims regarding the success rate of the Israeli defense systems. While Israel claimed to have shot down most missiles, the claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the ballistic missiles is not directly supported. Iran claimed that 90% of the missiles hit their targets.

The provided sources mention the Iron Dome as part of Israel's defense, but they do not specify the system's interception rate.

To verify the claim, I would need specific data on the Iron Dome's performance during the October 1, 2024, attack, including the number of missiles intercepted.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

There are claims the resolution sought to avert the risk of a crisis in US-Polish relations right at the start of Trump's second administrationImage: Carlos Barria/REUTERS

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on January 9, 2025, stating that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance at the commemoration. The article also includes an image of soldiers <image:1>.

The Los Angeles Times and DW.COM also reported on January 9 and January 22, 2025, respectively, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. The DW.COM article mentions that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event. Both articles mention the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The provided information indicates that Netanyahu might travel to Poland in January 2025, but it does not mention any events related to an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. The articles focus on the possibility of Netanyahu's travel to Poland for the Auschwitz anniversary and the potential for his arrest due to an ICC warrant.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Information about Netanyahu leaving Israel and fleeing to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, is missing.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on January 9, 2025, stating that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance at the commemoration. The article also includes an image of soldiers <image:1>.

The Los Angeles Times and DW.COM also reported on January 9 and January 22, 2025, respectively, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. The DW.COM article mentions that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event. Both articles mention the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The provided information indicates that Netanyahu might travel to Poland in January 2025, but it does not mention any events related to an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. The articles focus on the possibility of Netanyahu's travel to Poland for the Auschwitz anniversary and the potential for his arrest due to an ICC warrant.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Information about Netanyahu leaving Israel and fleeing to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, is missing.

Content: "<image:4532>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:4533>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:4532>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:4535>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Israelis demonstrate around 27 coffins symbolizing hostages killed in Gaza, as they protest for the release of Israelis held by Hamas terrorists in Gaza, outside the Defense Ministry Headquarters in Tel Aviv, September 5, 2024. <image:4537>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/F240905AVS48.jpg)

Israelis carry coffins symbolizing hostages murdered by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, as they protest in Tel Aviv for the release of remaining captives, September 5, 2024. (Oren Ziv/AFPTV/AFP)

Thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv on Thursday, carrying 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, demanding a deal to secure the remaining hostages’ release. They had been murdered days before Israeli troops reached them, almost 11 months after they’d been kidnapped from Israel during Hamas’s October 7 attack.

News of the hostages’ execution sparked outrage in Israel, and drew charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been refusing to pursue negotiations with Hamas in earnest, avoiding [concessions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/asked-to-decide-between-hostages-or-philadelphi-netanyahu-said-to-prefer-latter/)
 that might have allowed the Israelis to come home alive but would have endangered his ruling coalition.

As protesters in Tel Aviv gathered at Habima Square ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the [six slain hostages](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hersh-carmel-alex-eden-or-almog-the-6-hostages-murdered-by-hamas-just-days-ago/)
, accused Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shouted: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann said, noting the number of days Gat was held captive. (Adar Ayal)

The hostage families and supporters, carrying the caskets, held a mock funeral procession along Begin Street, in the direction of the Begin-Kaplan intersection, in front of the IDF headquarters.

The Tel Aviv thoroughfare has been a locus of demonstrations for a hostage deal and has been blocked by protesters every night since the slain hostages’ bodies were recovered last weekend.

When the 27 coffins arrived at the intersection, the protest began in earnest, swelling to some 2,000 people, who chanted slogans against the government and in favor of a deal.

“We are all hostages of the government of blood!” protesters yelled. <image:4538>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/09/WhatsApp-Image-2024-09-05-at-21.29.13.jpeg)

Israelis protest in Tel Aviv with photos of murdered hostages, at a demonstration calling for a deal to secure the release of remaining captives held by the Hamas terror group in Gaza, September 5, 2024. Significant crowds also gathered in Rehovot, Eilat and Jerusalem.

It was the fifth straight night of demonstrations, following the [recovery last Saturday](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-from-gaza-including-one-previously-presumed-alive/)
 of the bodies of six Israeli hostages. On the other side, cardboard planks spelled out: “Here lie our hostages.”

Inside the crowd, a man in Hasidic garb drew attention and applause as he delivered a philippic against Netanyahu.

“Redeeming the hostages is the entire Torah!” he shouted into a megaphone.

Police arrested six people at the demonstration, according to an organization that represents detained protesters. There was no immediate comment from police.

As the protest wound down, police on horseback rebuffed some 100 protesters who attempted to march outside the demonstration area on Begin Street.

Central Tel Aviv police chief Micah Gafni was seen pushing one protester out of the crowd and snatching his megaphone.

A column of officers later marched into the crowd and confiscated a protester’s drum, eliciting sarcastic applause.

Meanwhile, in Jerusalem, protesters gathered near the homes of Economy Minister Nir Barkat, Knesset Member Aryeh Deri, and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, as well as in the city’s central Zion Square.

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

## Claim
Claim: "<image:49> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli coffins protest")
image_search("Israeli coffins protest")
reverse_search(<image:49>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo)) discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages in February 2024, including images of the event <image:4533>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website shows an image of coffins draped with Israeli flags (<image:4548>). Al Jazeera published an article about Hamas, which states that Gaza captives will return in coffins if Israel continues raids, and includes an image of a protest (<image:4549>).


## Elaboration
The image search results show that coffins draped with Israeli flags have been used in protests. The BBC article mentions the return of bodies of Israeli hostages in February 2024. The Al Jazeera article discusses the return of Gaza captives in coffins.

Based on the evidence, it is possible that the image depicts a protest involving coffins draped with Israeli flags. However, the exact context and the specific event the image represents are not clear. The claim that the image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available information.

More information is needed to confirm the claim, such as the specific event, the date, and the identities of the deceased.

On 7 October 2023, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 mounted [an attack](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
 on Israel, abducting an estimated 251 people from the country, as well as killing 1,180 more. Since then, protests have been held in the country demanding the return of the hostages from Gaza.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:4-2)
 The first protest was held on 14 October 2023, in Tel Aviv criticizing the handling of the war by the Israeli government.[\[5\]](#cite_note-bizin-5)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
 Continued perceived inaction by the Israeli government on the issue caused additional rallies, and international rallies were held to mark the six-month anniversary and call for the return of hostages.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

On 1 September 2024, the [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 stated that six hostages taken by Hamas, including [Hersh Goldberg-Polin](/wiki/Hersh_Goldberg-Polin "Hersh Goldberg-Polin")
, had been found dead in a tunnel underneath [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
. Several protesters were arrested following clashes that broke out after the coffins were taken by police.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:2-3)

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home filmed by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.

A drone targets the Israeli prime minister's house during new barrages with Hezbollah

  !Smoke rises from an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Saturday. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

_CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting._

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially accurate. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. However, the image dates back to 2019, according to the reverse image search results. The web search results confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone strike in October 2024, but the provided image is not from that event. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

A spokesperson for Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed to media outlets on Monday for the first time that Israel was behind a string of devastating attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.

During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu reportedly boasted that Israel was behind the attacks, but while the Jewish state was widely believed to have been responsible, there had been no official confirmation from the government or military until spokesman Omer Dostri’s statement on Monday.

[On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded](https://www.timesofisrael.com/several-killed-thousands-hurt-as-wave-of-pager-explosions-strikes-hezbollah/)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.

The coordinated attack dealt a deadly blow to the Iran-backed Lebanese terror group, and kicked off an escalation that continued with the assassination of almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and a limited Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the incident was the “biggest security breach” for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.

Netanyahu reportedly claimed to cabinet ministers on Sunday that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation.

“The pager operation and the elimination of \[Hezbollah leader Hassan\] Nasrallah were carried out despite the opposition of senior officials in the defense establishment and those responsible for them in the political echelon,” he reportedly said, in a clear dig at recently fired defense minister Yoav Gallant.

The pager explosions occurred after almost a year of incessant rocket and drone attacks on Israel by the Hezbollah terror group, which began a day after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre and led to the evacuation of some 60,000 residents from northern Israel towns on the border with Lebanon.

![Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon begins](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Josh Einiger has details on the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.

LONDON -- Israel's cabinet has approved the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah after prolonged negotiations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the cabinet for approval Tuesday evening local time. local time, Biden said.

"Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security," the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.

Netanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.

"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon," Netanyahu said in a statement. We will continue together until victory."

The prime minister hailed "great achievements" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.

"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action," Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack."

Netanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.

This was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.

Netanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.

In October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.

Tensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. "If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holcoursepopup1.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. <image:4643>

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).  

The Hamas leader had arrived in Tehran earlier this week and had attended events at the parliament and an exhibition near Milad Tower before retiring to his residence.

Neither Hamas nor Iranian officials have yet commented publicly on the incident."

‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets
============================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Israeli intelligence sources reveal use of ‘Lavender’ system in Gaza war and claim permission given to kill civilians in pursuit of low-ranking militants

The Israeli military’s bombing campaign in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 used a previously undisclosed AI-powered database that at one stage identified 37,000 potential targets based on their apparent links to Hamas, according to intelligence sources involved in the war.

In addition to talking about their use of the AI system, called Lavender, the intelligence sources claim that Israeli military officials permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed, particularly during the early weeks and months of the [conflict](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war)
.

Their unusually candid testimony provides a rare glimpse into the first-hand experiences of Israeli intelligence officials who have been using machine-learning systems to help identify targets during the six-month war.

Israel’s use of powerful AI systems in its war on Hamas has entered uncharted territory for advanced warfare, raising a host of legal and moral questions, and transforming the relationship between military personnel and machines.

“This is unparalleled, in my memory,” said one intelligence officer who used Lavender, adding that they had more faith in a “statistical mechanism” than a grieving soldier. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images

The testimony from the six intelligence officers, all who have been involved in using AI systems to identify Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) targets in the war, was given to the journalist Yuval Abraham for a [report published by the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
.

Their accounts were shared exclusively with the Guardian in advance of publication. Four of the sources said that, at one stage early in the war, Lavender listed as many as 37,000 Palestinian men who had been linked by the AI system to Hamas or PIJ.

Lavender was developed by the Israel Defense Forces’ elite intelligence division, Unit 8200, which is comparable to the US’s National Security Agency or GCHQ in the UK.

Several of the sources described how, for certain categories of targets, the IDF applied pre-authorised allowances for the estimated number of civilians who could be killed before a strike was authorised.

Two sources said that during the early weeks of the war they were permitted to kill 15 or 20 civilians during airstrikes on low-ranking militants. Attacks on such targets were typically carried out using unguided munitions known as “dumb bombs”, the sources said, destroying entire homes and killing all their occupants.

“You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people – it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage \[of those bombs\],” one intelligence officer said. They help the Hamas government, but they don’t really endanger soldiers.”

Before the war, US and Israeli estimated membership of Hamas’s military wing at approximately 25-30,000 people.

\
Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/the-gospel-how-israel-uses-ai-to-select-bombing-targets)

In the weeks after the Hamas-led 7 October assault on southern Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped about 240 people, the sources said there was a decision to treat Palestinian men linked to Hamas’s military wing as potential targets, regardless of their rank or importance.

The IDF’s targeting processes in the most intensive phase of the bombardment were also relaxed, they said. They said that in wartime there was insufficient time to carefully “incriminate every target”.

“So you’re willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it,” they added.

‘It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home’
------------------------------------------

The testimonies published by +972 and Local Call may explain how such a western military with such advanced capabilities, with weapons that can conduct highly surgical strikes, has conducted a war with such a vast human toll.

When it came to targeting low-ranking Hamas and PIJ suspects, they said, the preference was to attack when they were believed to be at home. Book tickets [here](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2024/feb/16/guardian-newsroom-the-unfolding-crisis-in-the-middle-east)

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question. This one had a self-contained spyware, a covert scout concealed within the message that was to invade his device’s perimeter. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. This operation depicts how cyber espionage has slowly turned the conventional ware kind of ware where bytes and codes are more destructive than guns and grenades.

Thus, the employment of such enhanced spyware demonstrates how current cyber warfare strategies are constantly evolving. Spyware tools like Pegasus are interesting but present several ethical and legal issues primarily revolving on privacy and misuse."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")
web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel according to the sources. The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) and articles from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)).

None of the sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")
web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel according to the sources. The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) and articles from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)).

None of the sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in Nuseirat. The Countercurrents.org article states that they died in an Israeli bombing of the Al Jaoni School. The article was published on July 7, 2024, which is consistent with the claim's date of July 6, 2024. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the Nuseirat rescue and massacre, which occurred on June 8, 2024.

The claim does not mention the mother and grandmother. The evidence does not provide information about the circumstances of their deaths.

Verdict: The claim is partially supported.
