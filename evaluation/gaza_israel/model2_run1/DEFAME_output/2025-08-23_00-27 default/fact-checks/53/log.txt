The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024, the evidence does not support the specific quote attributed to him. Instead, a source indicates that Trump called for the annihilation of Iran if they assassinate him ([https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
