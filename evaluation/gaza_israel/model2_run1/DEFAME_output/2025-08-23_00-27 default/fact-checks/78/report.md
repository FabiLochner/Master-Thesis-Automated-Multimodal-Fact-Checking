## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on January 9, 2025, stating that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, as he faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance at the commemoration. The article also includes an image of soldiers ![image 1](media/0.jpg).

The Los Angeles Times and DW.COM also reported on January 9 and January 22, 2025, respectively, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. The DW.COM article mentions that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event. Both articles mention the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The provided information indicates that Netanyahu might travel to Poland in January 2025, but it does not mention any events related to an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. The articles focus on the possibility of Netanyahu's travel to Poland for the Auschwitz anniversary and the potential for his arrest due to an ICC warrant.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim. Information about Netanyahu leaving Israel and fleeing to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results describe an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, codenamed "Operation True Promise II" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)). The attack involved approximately 200 ballistic missiles launched from Iran, targeting Israeli military facilities. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) also reported on the attack, with Al Jazeera stating that the attack was in response to Israeli actions. Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack a "big mistake" ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The NPR article includes images of Israelis sheltering during the missile barrage ![image 281](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-334464.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024. However, the provided search results do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland during the attack.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms the occurrence of the missile attack but does not provide any information about Netanyahu's actions during that time.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024. However, there is no evidence in the search results to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland during the attack. The search results about Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland are related to a later event in January 2025.

The claim is not supported by the evidence, as there is no information about Netanyahu's actions during the missile attack. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While an Iranian missile attack on Israel did occur on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland during the attack. Information about Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland is related to a later event in January 2025, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next).
