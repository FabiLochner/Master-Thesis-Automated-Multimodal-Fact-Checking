## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel according to the sources. The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) and articles from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)).

None of the sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (![image 1](media/0.jpg))

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (![image 4643](media/2025-08-23_01-07-1755911275-462094.jpg)) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (![image 4657](media/2025-08-23_01-08-1755911291-919292.jpg), ![image 4658](media/2025-08-23_01-08-1755911292-467848.jpg))

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.
