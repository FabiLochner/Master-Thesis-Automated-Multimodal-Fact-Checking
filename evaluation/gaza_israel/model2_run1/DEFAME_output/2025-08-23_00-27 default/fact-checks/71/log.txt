The vegetable basket that once fed Gaza
=======================================

Israel has bulldozed the fertile area of Mirage, destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself and sentencing the people to a slow death.

In southern Gaza, just outside Rafah, lies Mirage—once known as the vegetable basket of Gaza. Then the tanks rolled in, trampling the land to ensure that it would no longer be suitable for agriculture.

Since March 2, 2025, almost no food or aid has entered Gaza, and people cannot find anything to eat. “Not because there’s no sun—but because there’s no reason to water what’s no longer alive.”

The Israeli assault on Mirage came not only with bulldozers grinding through the earth and drones buzzing menacingly overhead, but with the brutal understanding that destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself sentences it to a slow death.

Abu Suleiman’s eyes welled up as he remembered the tomatoes he grew that fed Gaza. Will we ever be free to make this land fertile again, or will the dust remain as a permanent reminder of what was lost?

!Platters of raw vegetables including carrots, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes. <image:4478>

_Vegetables from the market in January 2025, the last time they were readily available and affordable. This fertile area yielded vibrant red tomatoes, the earthy scent of freshly dug potatoes, the glossy purple of plump eggplants, and the sharp, clean smell of onions to homes across the besieged Gaza Strip.

Mirage now lies barren. Israel destroyed everything: the land, the homes, even the vegetables."

The claim '<image:43> This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor.' is false.
Justification: The image shows a vegetable stand with a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava, and the location is Syria, not Gaza, as confirmed by a Turkish news website ([Source](https://en.haberler.com/in-syria-an-abandoned-tank-has-become-a-fruit-and-2027395/)) and an AOL fact-check article. The image predates January 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
