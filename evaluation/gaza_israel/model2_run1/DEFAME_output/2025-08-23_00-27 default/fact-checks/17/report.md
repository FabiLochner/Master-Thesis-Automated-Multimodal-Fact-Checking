## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was targeted in July 2024. The attack occurred in the Arabian Sea, not the Gulf of Aden, according to Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/)) and VOA News ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-on-u-s--flagged-container-ship-sailing-through-arabian-sea/7692113.html)). The Columbian also mentions the Gulf of Aden ([Source](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/)), but the other sources are more specific.

A Maersk spokesperson confirmed the ship was one of its U.S.-flagged vessels. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. A U.S.-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in July 2024. However, the attack occurred in the Arabian Sea, not the Gulf of Aden, according to multiple sources. A Maersk spokesperson confirmed the ship was one of its U.S.-flagged vessels.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While a U.S.-flagged Maersk vessel was attacked in July 2024, the attack occurred in the Arabian Sea, not the Gulf of Aden, as reported by Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/)) and VOA News ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-on-u-s--flagged-container-ship-sailing-through-arabian-sea/7692113.html)). A Maersk spokesperson confirmed the ship was U.S.-flagged.
