## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) also reported on the investigation. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

The articles note the political implications of the match and that an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for "smartly avoiding meeting \[the] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight". <image:k> ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against the Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason for this was that Dris failed to make weight, not a direct withdrawal. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The evidence also suggests that the situation has political implications, as an Algerian newspaper seemingly celebrated Dris's failure to make weight as a way to avoid the match. This is not the first time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the Olympics.

Therefore, while the claim is not entirely accurate, it is close. The judoka did not compete, but the reason was not a direct withdrawal.


## Final Judgement
The Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against the Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason was that Dris failed to make weight, not a direct withdrawal. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The claim is partially accurate, as the judoka did not compete against the Israeli opponent. However, the reason was not a direct withdrawal, but failing to make weight. Therefore, the claim is slightly misleading. `false`
