A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home filmed by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.

A drone targets the Israeli prime minister's house during new barrages with Hezbollah

  !Smoke rises from an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Saturday. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

_CNN’s Eyad Kourdi and Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting._

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially accurate. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. However, the image dates back to 2019, according to the reverse image search results. The web search results confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone strike in October 2024, but the provided image is not from that event. Therefore, the claim is misleading.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

A spokesperson for Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed to media outlets on Monday for the first time that Israel was behind a string of devastating attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.

During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu reportedly boasted that Israel was behind the attacks, but while the Jewish state was widely believed to have been responsible, there had been no official confirmation from the government or military until spokesman Omer Dostri’s statement on Monday.

[On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded](https://www.timesofisrael.com/several-killed-thousands-hurt-as-wave-of-pager-explosions-strikes-hezbollah/)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.

The coordinated attack dealt a deadly blow to the Iran-backed Lebanese terror group, and kicked off an escalation that continued with the assassination of almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and a limited Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the incident was the “biggest security breach” for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.

Netanyahu reportedly claimed to cabinet ministers on Sunday that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation.

“The pager operation and the elimination of \[Hezbollah leader Hassan\] Nasrallah were carried out despite the opposition of senior officials in the defense establishment and those responsible for them in the political echelon,” he reportedly said, in a clear dig at recently fired defense minister Yoav Gallant.

The pager explosions occurred after almost a year of incessant rocket and drone attacks on Israel by the Hezbollah terror group, which began a day after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, massacre and led to the evacuation of some 60,000 residents from northern Israel towns on the border with Lebanon.

![Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon begins](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Josh Einiger has details on the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.

LONDON -- Israel's cabinet has approved the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah after prolonged negotiations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the cabinet for approval Tuesday evening local time. local time, Biden said.

"Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security," the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.

Netanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.

"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon," Netanyahu said in a statement. We will continue together until victory."

The prime minister hailed "great achievements" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.

"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action," Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack."

Netanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.

This was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.

Netanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.

In October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.

Tensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. "If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holcoursepopup1.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. <image:4643>

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).  

The Hamas leader had arrived in Tehran earlier this week and had attended events at the parliament and an exhibition near Milad Tower before retiring to his residence.

Neither Hamas nor Iranian officials have yet commented publicly on the incident."

‘The machine did it coldly’: Israel used AI to identify 37,000 Hamas targets
============================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Israeli intelligence sources reveal use of ‘Lavender’ system in Gaza war and claim permission given to kill civilians in pursuit of low-ranking militants

The Israeli military’s bombing campaign in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 used a previously undisclosed AI-powered database that at one stage identified 37,000 potential targets based on their apparent links to Hamas, according to intelligence sources involved in the war.

In addition to talking about their use of the AI system, called Lavender, the intelligence sources claim that Israeli military officials permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed, particularly during the early weeks and months of the [conflict](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war)
.

Their unusually candid testimony provides a rare glimpse into the first-hand experiences of Israeli intelligence officials who have been using machine-learning systems to help identify targets during the six-month war.

Israel’s use of powerful AI systems in its war on Hamas has entered uncharted territory for advanced warfare, raising a host of legal and moral questions, and transforming the relationship between military personnel and machines.

“This is unparalleled, in my memory,” said one intelligence officer who used Lavender, adding that they had more faith in a “statistical mechanism” than a grieving soldier. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images

The testimony from the six intelligence officers, all who have been involved in using AI systems to identify Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) targets in the war, was given to the journalist Yuval Abraham for a [report published by the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
.

Their accounts were shared exclusively with the Guardian in advance of publication. Four of the sources said that, at one stage early in the war, Lavender listed as many as 37,000 Palestinian men who had been linked by the AI system to Hamas or PIJ.

Lavender was developed by the Israel Defense Forces’ elite intelligence division, Unit 8200, which is comparable to the US’s National Security Agency or GCHQ in the UK.

Several of the sources described how, for certain categories of targets, the IDF applied pre-authorised allowances for the estimated number of civilians who could be killed before a strike was authorised.

Two sources said that during the early weeks of the war they were permitted to kill 15 or 20 civilians during airstrikes on low-ranking militants. Attacks on such targets were typically carried out using unguided munitions known as “dumb bombs”, the sources said, destroying entire homes and killing all their occupants.

“You don’t want to waste expensive bombs on unimportant people – it’s very expensive for the country and there’s a shortage \[of those bombs\],” one intelligence officer said. They help the Hamas government, but they don’t really endanger soldiers.”

Before the war, US and Israeli estimated membership of Hamas’s military wing at approximately 25-30,000 people.

\
Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/the-gospel-how-israel-uses-ai-to-select-bombing-targets)

In the weeks after the Hamas-led 7 October assault on southern Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed nearly 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped about 240 people, the sources said there was a decision to treat Palestinian men linked to Hamas’s military wing as potential targets, regardless of their rank or importance.

The IDF’s targeting processes in the most intensive phase of the bombardment were also relaxed, they said. They said that in wartime there was insufficient time to carefully “incriminate every target”.

“So you’re willing to take the margin of error of using artificial intelligence, risking collateral damage and civilians dying, and risking attacking by mistake, and to live with it,” they added.

‘It’s much easier to bomb a family’s home’
------------------------------------------

The testimonies published by +972 and Local Call may explain how such a western military with such advanced capabilities, with weapons that can conduct highly surgical strikes, has conducted a war with such a vast human toll.

When it came to targeting low-ranking Hamas and PIJ suspects, they said, the preference was to attack when they were believed to be at home. Book tickets [here](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2024/feb/16/guardian-newsroom-the-unfolding-crisis-in-the-middle-east)

### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question. This one had a self-contained spyware, a covert scout concealed within the message that was to invade his device’s perimeter. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. This operation depicts how cyber espionage has slowly turned the conventional ware kind of ware where bytes and codes are more destructive than guns and grenades.

Thus, the employment of such enhanced spyware demonstrates how current cyber warfare strategies are constantly evolving. Spyware tools like Pegasus are interesting but present several ethical and legal issues primarily revolving on privacy and misuse."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")
web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel according to the sources. The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) and articles from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)).

None of the sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024")
web_search("Israeli intelligence Hamas leader WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel according to the sources. The sources include a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) and articles from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)).

None of the sources mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
One source from CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements, with Hamas operatives contacting troops on WhatsApp, posing as fellow soldiers, and asking for intelligence. The IDF is aware of Hamas's activity and has launched operations to counter it. (<image:1>)

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31. Unconfirmed reports suggest spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking. (<image:4643>) The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp. (<image:4657>, <image:4658>)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported. While the provided sources confirm that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, the evidence is mixed regarding the use of WhatsApp for tracking.

One source mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking, which could have led to his assassination. However, other sources do not explicitly confirm this.

Therefore, the claim is neither fully verified nor refuted, as the evidence provides conflicting information. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in Nuseirat. The Countercurrents.org article states that they died in an Israeli bombing of the Al Jaoni School. The article was published on July 7, 2024, which is consistent with the claim's date of July 6, 2024. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the Nuseirat rescue and massacre, which occurred on June 8, 2024.

The claim does not mention the mother and grandmother. The evidence does not provide information about the circumstances of their deaths.

Verdict: The claim is partially supported.
