The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)) report that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Germany" and "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)) also reported on the event.

The New York Post and The Telegraph include images of Thunberg at the event (![image 392](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846185-389823.jpg), ![image 393](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846187-063198.jpg), ![image 394](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846189-584061.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 396](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846195-195779.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments. Specifically, she declared "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany, as reported by multiple news outlets ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)). The image in the claim shows Thunberg holding a sign with the same message. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the image's authenticity or the exact date (November 2024) the image was taken.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially true. While Greta Thunberg did express the sentiment "Fuck Israel" at a rally, the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the specific date (November 2024) the image was taken. Therefore, the claim is only partially accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Greta Thunberg did express anti-Israel sentiments, including saying "f–k Israel" at a rally, as reported by the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and other sources. However, the evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image or the specific date (November 2024) the image was taken.
