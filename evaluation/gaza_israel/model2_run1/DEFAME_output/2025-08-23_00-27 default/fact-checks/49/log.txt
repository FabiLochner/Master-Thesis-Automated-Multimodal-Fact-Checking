Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire): 
Content: The CNN article, published on July 26, 2024, reports on Kamala Harris's meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024. During the meeting, Harris expressed concern about the suffering in Gaza and urged Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire deal. The article quotes Harris saying, "It is time for this war to end." [<image:k>] The article also mentions Harris's reaffirmation of America’s “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel.

The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While Kamala Harris's support for Israel was a topic of discussion around July 22, 2024, and she reaffirmed America's commitment to Israel on July 25, 2024, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote, "Our support for Israel will continue," from July 22, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
