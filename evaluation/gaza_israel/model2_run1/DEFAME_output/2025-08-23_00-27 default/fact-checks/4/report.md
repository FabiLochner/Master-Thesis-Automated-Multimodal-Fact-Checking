## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The first web source from Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-)) contains images of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza from May 16, 2021. The image ![image 5](media/4.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources provide information about events in Gaza in December 2024. One source discusses an airstrike by the Israeli Air Force on December 12, 2024, in the Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in at least 33 deaths. Another source, an Amnesty International report, concludes that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, documenting Israeli actions between October 7, 2023, and early July 2024. The BBC News reported on Israeli strikes in Gaza on December 23, 2024, which resulted in the deaths of at least 28 people. The image ![image 5](media/4.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is from Anadolu and depicts Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. The provided evidence indicates that the image is not of the U.S. bombarding Yemen. The image is likely from May 16, 2021, or from December 2024, when there were Israeli airstrikes on Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image is from Anadolu and depicts Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. The claim that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image, credited to Anadolu, depicts Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, not the U.S. bombarding Yemen. Evidence from a reverse image search and web searches, including sources like the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-)), confirms the image's origin and context.
