The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While there was an assassination plot against Donald Trump, it was orchestrated by Iran, not Jewish Americans, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department)). The evidence also supports the U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel war, as discussed by PBS NewsHour ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/what-to-know-about-the-u-s-militarys-intervention-in-the-israel-iran-war)).
