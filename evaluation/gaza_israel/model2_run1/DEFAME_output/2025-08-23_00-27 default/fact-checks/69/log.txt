Content: The search result from Syria Direct includes an image of Israeli military forces. <image:4558>

The claim '<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of Israeli military activity in the Tasil area, Syria, the provided evidence does not confirm the date (February 2025) or the specific context of the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
