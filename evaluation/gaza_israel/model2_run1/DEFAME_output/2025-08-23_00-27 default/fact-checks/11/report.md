## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, The Times of Israel reported on a Hezbollah drone attack on Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, including a photo of Herzi Halevi (<image:k>) and mentioning criticism of Halevi for the IDF's response to the attack ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/)). The Jerusalem Post also published an article on the same day, written by Keshet Neev, stating that false rumors about IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death in a Hezbollah attack were spreading on social media, and mentioning a Hezbollah drone attack that wounded over 60 people (<image:i>) ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli army base in Binyamina, north of Tel Aviv, resulting in the death of four soldiers and injuries to over 60 others (<image:k> from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24)). The attack targeted the Zar’it barracks of the Golani Brigade Training Base in Binyamina, Israel ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina)).

The attack was in retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2) <image:k>).


## Elaboration
1.  The Jerusalem Post reported on October 13, 2024, that rumors of Herzi Halevi's death in a Hezbollah attack were circulating on social media.
2.  On the same day, CNN and Wikipedia reported a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli army base in Binyamina, resulting in casualties.
3.  The Times of Israel reported on a Hezbollah drone attack on Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea, including a photo of Herzi Halevi.
4.  The evidence indicates that there was a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, but it does not confirm that Herzi Halevi was assassinated. The Jerusalem Post explicitly mentions that rumors of his death were false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there was a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, but it does not confirm that Herzi Halevi was assassinated. The Jerusalem Post explicitly mentions that rumors of his death were false.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli army base, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina), but there is no evidence to support the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated. In fact, [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443) reported that rumors of his death were circulating but were false.
