The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli army base, as reported by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina), but there is no evidence to support the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated.
