## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 8](media/8.jpg) of an explosion over a city at night is found on multiple websites. One source, "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)", labels the image as "A picture of the raid that targeted the Al-Laylaki area a short while ago" and dates it October 22, 2024 ![image 645](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873814-356134.jpg).

Another source, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", also contains the image with the same label and date ![image 648](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873818-669516.jpg). The image is also found on "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)" ![image 649](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873823-228030.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Israel attacking Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. The image is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, and is labeled as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area.

The evidence suggests the image depicts an event that occurred on October 22, 2024, not October 26, 2024, as the claim states. The evidence also does not mention Israel or Iranian military targets.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, and is labeled as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area. The claim states the image shows an event on October 26, 2024, and mentions Israel attacking Iranian military targets, which is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is associated with an event on October 22, 2024, as evidenced by sources like "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)" and "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max/)", which label it as a raid targeting the Al-Laylaki area. The claim's assertion of an October 26, 2024, event involving Israel and Iranian military targets is not supported by the available evidence.
