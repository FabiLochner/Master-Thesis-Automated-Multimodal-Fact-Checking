Wikipedia discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, mentioning Israeli strikes in Beirut, including the near-total closure of Beirut's airport. Many airlines shut down services at Beirutâ€“Rafic Hariri International Airport due to Israeli airstrikes. ![image 10](media/10.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image is AI-generated and does not depict a real event. Multiple sources confirm that the image was created using AI and is not authentic.


## Final Judgement
The claim is based on an AI-generated image. While there were Israeli airstrikes near Beirut airport in October 2024, the image itself is not authentic.

`false`
