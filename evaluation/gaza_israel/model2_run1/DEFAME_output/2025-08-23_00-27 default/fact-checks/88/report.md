## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Esmail Qaani in disguise.

The web search results further support this, mentioning the image's circulation during the Israel-Hezbollah war and rumors of an assassination attempt.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm the reason for the disguise, but it implies that it was a tactic to avoid being targeted. The context provided by the sources suggests that the disguise was likely a response to threats or attacks.

The claim is likely true, based on the available evidence.
