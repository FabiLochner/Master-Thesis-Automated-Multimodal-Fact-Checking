Content: Mondoweiss published an article in January 2025 about Palestinians searching for missing loved ones in Gaza, including an image of a skeleton and a shoe. <image:521>

Useful result: From [Source](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363): 
Content: The image is digitally generated. <image:522>

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Gaza conflict has resulted in numerous casualties and suffering, the image of the mother holding a skeleton is digitally generated, as indicated by image search results from ABP Live and Mondoweiss ([https://www.mondoweiss.net/](https://www.mondoweiss.net/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
