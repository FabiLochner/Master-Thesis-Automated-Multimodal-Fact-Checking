## Claim
Claim: "![image 59](media/92.jpg) This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 59](media/92.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 59](media/92.jpg)) shows a Syrian child named Sham who was rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023. The child was later transferred to Abu Dhabi's Burjeel Hospital for treatment.

The image was found in articles from Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), UAE Times ([https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), and El Pa√≠s ([https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html)).


## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian child, not a Palestinian child. The child was rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake in February 2023, not after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in July 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Syrian child rescued after an earthquake in Syria, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian child rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake in February 2023, as reported by Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.
