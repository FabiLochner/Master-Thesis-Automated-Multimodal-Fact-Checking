Useful result: From [Source](https://www.columnblog.com/p/if-harris-opposes-trumps-horrific): 
Content: The Column, published on May 19, 2025, discusses the political debate surrounding Kamala Harris's stance on the Gaza conflict and her potential differences with Donald Trump's policies. The article suggests that Harris should publicly criticize Trump's policies on Gaza to gain political points and pressure the White House. <image:1562>.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there are reports of a phone call between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, the existence of the call is disputed by both Trump and Netanyahu's offices, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248) and [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-denies-reports-of-speaking-to-donald-trump-over-gaza-ceasefire-6343281). Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Trump's motivation was to influence the ceasefire to affect Kamala Harris's campaign.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
