## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The memorial includes a bronze sculpture of an American flag morphing into a flame.

The evidence does not explicitly state that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the claim that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is false, as multiple sources, such as [Memorial Mapping](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/browse-by-country) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks), confirm the existence of other 9/11 memorials in various countries.
