Content: The search result from Memorial Mapping lists several countries with 9/11 memorials outside the US, including Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The number of memorials in each country is also provided.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks" lists several 9/11 memorials, including the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The article does not explicitly state that the Jerusalem memorial is the only one outside the US. Other memorials mentioned include the Central Kitsap 9/11 Memorial in Bremerton, Washington, and a memorial outside the Air Mobility Command Museum near Dover, Delaware. <image:50>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/september-11-memorials-slideshow): 
Content: The Architectural Digest article features several 9/11 memorials, including the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, designed by Eliezer Weishoff. <image:50> The article also mentions memorials in Bayonne, New Jersey, and Boston, Massachusetts, among others.

The claim '<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the claim that this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is false, as multiple sources, such as [Memorial Mapping](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/browse-by-country) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks), confirm the existence of other 9/11 memorials in various countries.

So, the overall veracity is: false
