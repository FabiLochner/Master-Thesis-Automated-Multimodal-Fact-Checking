## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Israel" at a rally in Germany in December. However, the evidence does not show that she held a sign with the words "FUCK ISRAEL" in November 2024.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is authentic, but the claim that Greta Thunberg held a sign reading "FUCK ISRAEL" is not supported by the evidence. While she did make the statement, there is no evidence of her holding a sign with those words. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

While Greta Thunberg did say "f–k Israel" at a rally in December 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that she held a sign with the words "FUCK ISRAEL" in November 2024.
