## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg): Found exact image on website with title: File:Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg
Content: The image is from Wikimedia Commons and is titled "Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg". The image shows two soldiers in Babil Province Iraq in 2007. The image was uploaded on June 21, 2011, and is in the public domain. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image is of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, according to the Wikimedia Commons entry. The claim states that the image shows General John Pagri, who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.

The evidence contradicts the claim. The image is not of General John Pagri, and it was taken in Iraq in 2007, not in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image is from 2007 and shows soldiers in Iraq, not General John Pagri in the Gaza Strip in 2025. The claim misrepresents the image's origin, content, and meaning.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image in the claim is a photograph of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, taken in 2007, as evidenced by the [Wikimedia Commons entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg). The claim incorrectly identifies the individuals and the location, making it misleading.
