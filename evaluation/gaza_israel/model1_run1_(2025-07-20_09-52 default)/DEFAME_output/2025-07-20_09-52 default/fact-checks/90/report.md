## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
ESPN reports that the International Judo Federation will investigate why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. This disqualification marks the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics. In Tokyo 2021, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul.

The Guardian states that the IJF is investigating Dris's failure to make weight for his bout with Butbul. An Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for "smartly avoiding meeting \[the] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight".

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the 2024 Olympics. Dris failed to make weight, leading to an investigation by the International Judo Federation. An Algerian newspaper suggested that Dris avoided the match.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate. Multiple reliable sources confirm that an Algerian judo athlete, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against his Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the 2024 Olympics due to failing to make weight.
