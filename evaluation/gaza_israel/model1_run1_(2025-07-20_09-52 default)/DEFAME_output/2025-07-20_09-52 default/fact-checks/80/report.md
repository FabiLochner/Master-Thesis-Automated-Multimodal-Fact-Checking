The Times of Israel mentions 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in captivity. ![image 49](media/80.jpg)

A BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo)) from February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages. ![image 2228](media/2025-07-20_11-04-1753009451-365528.jpg) ![image 2227](media/2025-07-20_11-04-1753009451-090791.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where demonstrators used mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolize hostages held in Gaza. The Times of Israel reported that the coffins represented hostages killed in captivity. Therefore, the claim that the image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers is inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, to symbolize hostages held in Gaza, not dead Israeli soldiers. The claim misrepresents the context and purpose of the coffins.

`misleading`
