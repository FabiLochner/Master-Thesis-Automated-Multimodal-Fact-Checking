Content: The search result from IFJ.org lists numerous journalists killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The list includes Ibrahim Muhareb, who was killed due to Israeli gunfire and shelling in western Khan Yunis on August 18, 2024. The source also mentions the killing of several other journalists in Israeli airstrikes in different locations and dates.

The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is not enough information.
Justification: The claim is partially verifiable. While the image is confirmed to be of Sham Imad Muhareb, and there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm whether the baby lost her arm in an Israeli airstrike. Therefore, the claim is considered to have `not enough information`.

So, the overall veracity is: not enough information
