## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo)) reports on an airstrike on April 9, 2025, resulting in deaths and injuries. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hundreds-thousands-flee-israel-seizes-rafah-new-gaza-security-zone-2025-04-03/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hundreds-thousands-flee-israel-seizes-rafah-new-gaza-security-zone-2025-04-03/)) mentions an airstrike on April 3, 2025, and the displacement of Palestinians. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike)) discusses the April 9, 2025, airstrike and the context of the 2025 Gaza war. ![image 1707](media/2025-07-20_10-43-1753008232-451336.jpg), ![image 1709](media/2025-07-20_10-43-1753008232-852116.jpg), ![image 1710](media/2025-07-20_10-43-1753008238-019756.jpg)

These sources confirm the occurrence of Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state whether Sham Imad Muhareb lost her arm in an airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.ifj.org/es/actions/projects/africa/informa-formation-sur-les-phenomenes-migratoires-en-afrique-de-louest?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=21667&tx_news_pi1%5BoverwriteDemand%5D%5Bcategories%5D=47&cHash=7448603e6b0fa12844a83484b8707019): 
Content: The search result from IFJ.org lists numerous journalists killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The list includes Ibrahim Muhareb, who was killed due to Israeli gunfire and shelling in western Khan Yunis on August 18, 2024. The source also mentions the killing of several other journalists in Israeli airstrikes in different locations and dates.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The evidence also mentions that Ibrahim Muhareb was killed due to Israeli gunfire and shelling. However, the evidence does not mention anything about Sham Imad Muhareb's arm injury or whether she was injured in an Israeli airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially verifiable. The image is of Sham Imad Muhareb, and there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm whether the baby lost her arm in an Israeli airstrike. Therefore, the claim is `not enough information`.

### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The claim is partially verifiable. While the image is confirmed to be of Sham Imad Muhareb, and there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaia neighborhood in April 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm whether the baby lost her arm in an Israeli airstrike. Therefore, the claim is considered to have `not enough information`.
