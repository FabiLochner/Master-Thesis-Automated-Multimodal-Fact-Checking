## Claim
Claim: "![image 53](media/84.jpg) This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) shows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image is from 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster.

The image was also found on PesaCheck, which published an article on August 28, 2024. The Times of Israel published an article about the Prime Minister's Residence, but the image is not included in the article. The article mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim is not accurate. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024. The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020. The evidence also mentions a Hezbollah attack on the PM's home in October 2024, which does not align with the claim's timeframe.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024. The claim also states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone, which is not supported by the evidence.

`misleading`

### Verdict: MISLEADING

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024, as claimed. The image was featured in a _Times of Israel_ article from June 25, 2020, and the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence.
