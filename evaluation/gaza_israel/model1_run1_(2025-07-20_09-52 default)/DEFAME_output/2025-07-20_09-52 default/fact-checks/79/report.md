The article includes images ![image 2202](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009419-732500.jpg), ![image 2211](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009424-208027.jpg), ![image 2213](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009424-579305.jpg), ![image 2214](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009424-997047.jpg), ![image 2216](media/2025-07-20_11-03-1753009425-382838.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched rockets at the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided search results do not include the image in the claim. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase after an attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While there is evidence of an attack on the airbase on that date, the image has not been verified. Therefore, the claim is `not enough information`.

### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified because, while there is evidence of a Hezbollah rocket attack on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, the provided image has not been found in any of the search results ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/), [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267), [Press TV](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/09/22/733773/explainer-hezbollah-struck-ramat-david-airbase-rafael-arms-factory-haifa)).
