## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Syriacpress.com article ([https://syriacpress.com/blog/2025/07/13/israeli-tanks-advance-in-quneitra-countryside-as-anti-isis-protests-erupt-in-daraa/](https://syriacpress.com/blog/2025/07/13/israeli-tanks-advance-in-quneitra-countryside-as-anti-isis-protests-erupt-in-daraa/)) discusses Israeli military activity in the Quneitra and Daraa governorates of Syria in July 2025, including ground incursions and protests in Tasil. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_Syria_(2024%E2%80%93present))) details the Israeli invasion of Syria, which began on December 8, 2024, and mentions IDF raids in Rif Dimashq and Daraa on February 25, and an incursion on March 19, 2025. The Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/israeli-incursion-into-quneitra-and-demonstrations-in-daraa-against-return-of-isis-mercenaries](https://hawarnews.com/en/israeli-incursion-into-quneitra-and-demonstrations-in-daraa-against-return-of-isis-mercenaries)) reported on July 13, 2025, on Israeli patrols in Quneitra and a demonstration in Tasil, Daraa. ![image 2050](media/2025-07-20_10-56-1753009002-022011.jpg) ![image 42](media/69.jpg) ![image 42](media/69.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the "2025 Israeli military operation in the West Bank" (<image:i>), also known as "Iron Wall," which began on January 21, 2025, involving the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and targeting Palestinian militants. Al Jazeera reported on February 24, 2025, about Israeli military raids in the occupied West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarem, and the deployment of Israeli tanks. Another source, dated February 10, 2025, provides an Israel at War Situation Report, mentioning IDF operations in Gaza, a strike on a Hezbollah tunnel, and a counterterrorism operation in the West Bank.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The web search results confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. The Wikipedia article and the Syriacpress.com article mention Israeli incursions and demonstrations in Tasil. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The image itself is present in the evidence, but its origin and context are not specified.

Therefore, while the claim's general context is supported, the specific details about the image and the exact date cannot be verified with the available information.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/): 
Content: The search result from syriadirect.org contains an image of Israeli military forces. ![image 2103](media/2025-07-20_11-00-1753009224-417475.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image search provides an image of Israeli military forces, but it does not match the original image. The evidence confirms Israeli military presence in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. However, the evidence does not confirm that the original image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.

`not enough information`

### Verdict: NEI

### Justification
The claim cannot be fully verified. While there is evidence of Israeli military activity in the Daraa governorate, including Tasil, in 2025, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.
