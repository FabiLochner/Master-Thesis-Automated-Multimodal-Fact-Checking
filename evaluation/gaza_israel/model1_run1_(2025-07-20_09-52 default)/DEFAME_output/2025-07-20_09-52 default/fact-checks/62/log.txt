Content: India Today reports that protestors in Kolkata marched in support of Palestine. <image:1747>

Content: Getty Images shows images of a pro-Palestine protest in Kolkata, India. <image:1748>

The claim '<image:37> This image shows thousands gathering at Sohrawardi Park in Kolkata, India, in April 2025 to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.' is misleading.
Justification: The image likely depicts a pro-Palestine protest in Kolkata, India, as supported by the `geolocate` results and image search results, which found reports of similar protests in Kolkata ([https://thewire.in/rights/genocide-in-palestine-left-parties-march-in-kolkata-question-indian-govts-stand](https://thewire.in/rights/genocide-in-palestine-left-parties-march-in-kolkata-question-indian-govts-stand), [https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/kolkata/story/protestors-in-kolkata-march-in-support-of-palestine-2448209-2023-10-12](https://www.indiatoday.in/cities/kolkata/story/protestors-in-kolkata-march-in-support-of-palestine-2448209-2023-10-12)). However, the claim's specific details about the location (Sohrawardi Park) and the date (April 2025) are not confirmed.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
