## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence)), The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)), and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)). The attack was part of the Israeli–Lebanese conflict and was claimed by Hezbollah.

The Times of Israel reported that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The Reuters article also stated that Netanyahu was not present and there were no casualties. The Times of Israel included a tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu describing the attack as an assassination attempt. The Wikipedia article mentions that Yair Netanyahu is the son of Benjamin Netanyahu. <image:k>, ![image 2105](media/2025-07-20_11-00-1753009248-153351.jpg), ![image 2106](media/2025-07-20_11-00-1753009248-503944.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`

Content: The New York Times reports that on October 19, 2024, a drone struck a building near Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel. <image:i> The article mentions that Netanyahu and his wife were not home at the time and there were no injuries.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack occurred on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)). However, the provided sources explicitly state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The drone attack on October 19, 2024, did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, but reports indicate that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, in Caesarea, Israel, multiple sources ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)) state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The provided evidence does not support the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.
