Content: The search result from Eurovision News | Spotlight states that a video and still images shared online falsely claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces.

Content: The article from Caliber.Az, published on October 15, 2024, reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania. The article mentions that Zelenskyy inscribed messages on US bombs, including the phrase "Glory to Ukraine." The article also states that the visit stirred controversy. <image:40>

The claim '<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing US-made munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant on September 23, 2024, not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza, as claimed. The event is documented by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o)) and AP News ([https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09)).
