Content: The United Nations Security Council failed to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a veto by the United States on November 20, 2024. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also demanded the release of hostages and access to basic services for Gaza's civilian population. The U.S. representative stated that the resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Conscription in the United States" details the history of the draft in the US, including its use in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It provides statistics on the number of draftees during these conflicts. The article also mentions the Selective Service System and the legal framework for conscription, including the role of the National Guard and the unorganized militia. It does not mention the US reinstituting the draft in 2024.

Useful result: From [Source](https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/article/to-field-an-army-a-short-history-of-the-draft/): 
Content: The Warfare History Network published an article discussing the history of the draft. The article mentions the Military Service Act in Canada in 1917, the draft during the Vietnam era (August 1964 through February 1973), and the requirement for young men to register for the draft until April 1975. The article also includes images of American draftees in June 1917 <image:1> and soldiers during WWII <image:2>.

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple searches, including a review of the history of the US draft ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)), and news regarding the Israel-Hamas war, failed to provide any evidence that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
