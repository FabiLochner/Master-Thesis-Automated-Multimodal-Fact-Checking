Useful result: From [Source](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations): Found exact image on website with title: Russian Youth More Favorable Toward Israel than Older Generations
Content: The search result from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs includes an image of Israeli tanks. <image:45> The article discusses a survey conducted in September-October 2024, which found that young Russians have different views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict compared to older generations. The article does not mention the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria.

The reverse image search results show the image is associated with events in Gaza, as reported by sources like [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801) and [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720).
