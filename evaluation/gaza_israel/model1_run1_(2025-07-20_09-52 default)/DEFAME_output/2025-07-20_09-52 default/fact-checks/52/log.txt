Useful result: From [Source](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza): 
Content: The World Population Review estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth. The population in 1950 was 63,444. The growth rate is 3% per year.

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While one source cites a 2.02% increase based on pre-October 7, 2023, growth forecasts, multiple sources, including CNN and The Times of Israel, report a 6% decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, due to the ongoing conflict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
