Useful result: From [Source](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024):

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon): 
Content: The provided Wikipedia article discusses the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, which were part of the ongoing Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict. The attacks occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024. The article mentions attacks on various dates, including September 30, 2024, when Hezbollah fired 35 rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights. <image:11> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim is not related to the alleged attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Reverse image searches show the image depicts a fire at a chemical plant in New Jersey and a fireworks warehouse in California. While there were attacks on September 30, 2024, including a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)), the image does not depict this event.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
