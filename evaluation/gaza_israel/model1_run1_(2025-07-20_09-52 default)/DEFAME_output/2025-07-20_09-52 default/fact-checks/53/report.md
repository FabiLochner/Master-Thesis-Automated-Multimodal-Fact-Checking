## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, the content of his posts on that day, according to the provided sources, included comments about Kamala Harris's meeting with Netanyahu and a statement about annihilating Iran if he were assassinated. There is no mention of Trump posting "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on July 25, 2024.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, but the content of his posts, according to the provided sources, did not include the statement "I hope that America obliterates Israel." Instead, he commented on Kamala Harris and Netanyahu, and also mentioned Iran.
