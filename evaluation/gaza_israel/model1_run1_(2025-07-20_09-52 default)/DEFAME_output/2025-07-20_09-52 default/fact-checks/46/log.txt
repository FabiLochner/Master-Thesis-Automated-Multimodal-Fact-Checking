Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof): 
Content: The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief for developing countries. It also mentions that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid to treat victims of the Ebola virus. The page also includes a discography of Geldof's solo albums. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394): 
Content: The article from Dublin Live, published on November 3, 2024, discusses singer Mary Coughlan's criticism of Bono and Bob Geldof for not speaking out about the situation in Gaza, comparing it to their involvement in Live Aid in the 1980s. The article mentions Bono's and Geldof's calls for peace in the Middle East.

The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The search results do not support the claim that U2 and Bob Geldof announced a tour to aid the Israeli army in November 2024. A Dublin Live article from November 2024 ([Dublin Live](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/mary-coughlan-slams-bono-bob-28095856)) discusses criticism of Bono and Geldof, but not a tour for the Israeli army.

So, the overall veracity is: false
