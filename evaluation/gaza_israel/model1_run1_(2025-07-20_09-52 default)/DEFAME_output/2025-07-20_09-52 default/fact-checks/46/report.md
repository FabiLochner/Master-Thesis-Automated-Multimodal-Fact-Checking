```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief for developing countries. It also mentions that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid to treat victims of the Ebola virus. The page also includes a discography of Geldof's solo albums. <image:k>

An article from Dublin Live, published on November 3, 2024, discusses singer Mary Coughlan's criticism of Bono and Bob Geldof for not speaking out about the situation in Gaza, comparing it to their involvement in Live Aid in the 1980s. The article mentions Bono's and Geldof's calls for peace in the Middle East.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence does not support the claim.
2.  The search results mention a Dublin Live article from November 2024, which discusses Mary Coughlan's criticism of Bono and Bob Geldof. The article does not mention any tour to aid the Israeli army.
3.  The evidence suggests that Bono and Geldof have called for peace in the Middle East.
4.  The Wikipedia page mentions Geldof's work with Bono and a Band Aid project in November 2014, but not a tour to aid the Israeli army.
5.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results do not support the claim. There is no mention of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army in November 2024. The evidence suggests that Bono and Geldof have called for peace in the Middle East.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results do not support the claim that U2 and Bob Geldof announced a tour to aid the Israeli army in November 2024. A Dublin Live article from November 2024 ([Dublin Live](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/mary-coughlan-slams-bono-bob-28095856)) discusses criticism of Bono and Geldof, but not a tour for the Israeli army.
