The claim '<image:14> This image shows the Israeli Olympic team spelling out 'Bring Them Home' at the 2024 Olympic games because they were not allowed to wear their yellow 'Bring Them Home' pins.' is misleading.
Justification: The image of the Israeli swimmers spelling out "Bring Them Home Now" is not from the 2024 Olympics, as reported by [stljewishlight.org](https://stljewishlight.org/sports/those-viral-images-of-israeli-olympians-advocating-to-bring-them-home-are-not-actually-from-the-olympics/) and [WCNC.com](https://www.wcnc.com/video/news/verify/olympics-verify/israel-swim-team-bring-them-home-now-image-not-from-olympics-video/536-9ef735d9-23f4-4928-9611-d6607538e54f). The claim that the team created the image because they were not allowed to wear "Bring Them Home" pins is therefore false.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
