## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published a live blog on July 7-8, 2025, covering Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting at the White House, mentioning Elon Musk was called "off the rails" by Trump. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu in April. ([https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/07/donald-trump-elon-musk-new-party-us-politics-live-latest-news](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/07/donald-trump-elon-musk-new-party-us-politics-live-latest-news))

France 24 reported on February 5, 2025, that a photo of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 16](media/19.jpg)) is AI-generated, circulating on social media after a meeting between Israeli and US leaders. NDTV.com, on January 20, 2025, discussed Elon Musk's praise for Donald Trump's negotiation skills.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image in question (![image 16](media/19.jpg)) is AI-generated, according to France 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20250205-photo-of-elon-musk-donald-trump-and-benjamin-netanyahu-is-ai-generated](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20250205-photo-of-elon-musk-donald-trump-and-benjamin-netanyahu-is-ai-generated)). The claim that it is an authentic image is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is confirmed to be AI-generated, contradicting the claim that it is an authentic image. Therefore, the claim is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to France 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20250205-photo-of-elon-musk-donald-trump-and-benjamin-netanyahu-is-ai-generated](https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20250205-photo-of-elon-musk-donald-trump-and-benjamin-netanyahu-is-ai-generated)), the image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk is AI-generated, not an authentic photograph.
