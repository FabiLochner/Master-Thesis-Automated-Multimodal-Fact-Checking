Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24): Found exact image on website with title: USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrives in Kiel, Germany, marking its ...
Content: The image is of the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The USS Mount Whitney arrived in Kiel, Germany on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24. The exercise involved various NATO allies.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.c6f.navy.mil/Press-Room/News/News-Display/Article/3814280/baltops-24-concludes-in-kiel-germany/): Found exact image on website with title: BALTOPS 24 concludes in Kiel, Germany - U.S. Naval Forces Europe
Content: The image is from a U.S. Navy website and shows ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. <image:55> The exercise involved over 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/Article/3815129/baltops-24-concludes-in-kiel-germany/): Found exact image on website with title: BALTOPS 24 Concludes In Kiel, Germany - Navy.mil
Content: The image is from the U.S. Navy website and shows the BALTOPS 24 exercise, which concluded on June 20, 2024, in Kiel, Germany. <image:55> The exercise involved over 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and approximately 9,000 personnel from NATO allies.

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is misleading.
Justification: The image in the claim is misrepresented. The photo shows the USS Mount Whitney and other ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search. While the U.S. did send warships to the Mediterranean in August 2024, as reported by The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html)), the image does not depict this event.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
