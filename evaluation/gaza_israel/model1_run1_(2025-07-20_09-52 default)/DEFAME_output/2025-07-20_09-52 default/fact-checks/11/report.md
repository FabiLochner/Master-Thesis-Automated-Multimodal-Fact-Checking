## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel reports on government ministers criticizing IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi for the IDF's response to a Hezbollah drone attack, published in October 2024. The article does not mention Halevi being assassinated. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

The Jerusalem Post reports on false rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death in a Hezbollah attack that spread on social media. The article was published on October 13, 2024, and updated on October 14, 2024. ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli military base near Binyamina, north of Tel Aviv, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24)) and Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina)). The attack resulted in the death of four soldiers and injuries to over 60 others. The AP also reported the attack ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2)).

The sources do not mention the assassination of Herzi Halevi.


## Elaboration
The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, is false. While there was a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on that date, which resulted in casualties, reports from The Jerusalem Post explicitly state that rumors of Halevi's death were circulating on social media but were untrue. Furthermore, The Times of Israel reported on government ministers criticizing Halevi for the IDF's response to a Hezbollah drone attack, but did not mention his assassination.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that while a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, there is no credible evidence to support the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated. News reports specifically debunked rumors of his death.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack occurred on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, reports from The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) debunked rumors of Herzi Halevi's death. Additionally, The Times of Israel reported on government criticism of Halevi without mentioning his assassination ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministers-blast-idf-chief-in-ambush-over-gaza-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-reports/)).
