The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is misleading.
Justification: The claim is misleading. While there was an assassination plot against Donald Trump, it was orchestrated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, not Jewish Americans, as revealed by the Department of Justice ([https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-brings-charges-thwarted-iranian-plot-assassinate-tr-rcna179342](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-brings-charges-thwarted-iranian-plot-assassinate-tr-rcna179342)). Furthermore, the U.S. was involved in the Israel-Iran war, including bombing Iranian nuclear sites, but the claim oversimplifies the complex geopolitical dynamics.

So, the overall veracity is: misleading
