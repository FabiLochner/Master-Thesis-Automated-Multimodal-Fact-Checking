### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to [Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy), the video and images were falsely claimed to show Zelenskyy signing shells for use in Gaza. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs. Zelenskyy wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on the shells, referencing Ukraineâ€™s war with Russia.

The visit stirred controversy. ![image 40](media/66.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in September 2024, not in March 2025. The shells were for Ukraine's defense, not for use against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. factory in September 2024, not Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza in March 2025. The shells were for Ukraine's defense. `false`
