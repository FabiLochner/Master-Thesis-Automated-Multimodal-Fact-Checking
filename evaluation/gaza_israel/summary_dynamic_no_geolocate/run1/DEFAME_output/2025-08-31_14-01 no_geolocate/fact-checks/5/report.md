## Claim
Claim: "![image 6](media/5.jpg) This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 6](media/5.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares was found in multiple sources. One source, from The Times of Israel, states that the image was taken during fighting in Gaza in May 2019, and also mentions an Israeli helicopter downed by Hezbollah in 2006. Another source, PesaCheck, states that the image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon. A third source, Arab News PK, indicates the image was taken on March 25, 2019, during Israeli airstrikes on Hamas targets in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts an Israeli helicopter, but it was not shot down by Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024. The image was taken in 2019 during fighting in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image is of an Israeli helicopter, but it was taken in 2019 during fighting in Gaza, not in Southern Lebanon in 2024. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts an Israeli helicopter deploying flares, but it was taken in Gaza in 2019, not in Southern Lebanon in 2024 as the claim states. This is supported by sources such as The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/)) and Arab News PK ([https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east)).
