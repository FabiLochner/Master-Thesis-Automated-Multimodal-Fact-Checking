Useful result: From [Source](https://english.aawsat.com/features/5051777-besieged-gazans-share-shoes-wear-same-clothes-months): 
Content: The article from Asharq Al-Awsat, published on August 18, 2024, discusses the difficulties Gazans face in obtaining clothing due to the ongoing conflict, including the lack of clothing and the impact on the textile industry. The article mentions the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The article includes an image of Palestinians waiting for a cobbler to repair their shoes in Khan Younis on July 5, 2024. <image:12785>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/06/israel-gaza-war-hamas): 
Content: The New Yorker article from November 6, 2023, discusses the Israeli-Gaza conflict, mentioning the presence of tanks and the impact on civilians. The article includes an image of a Hamas fighter outside a burned home near the border with Gaza. <image:12784>

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence, including web and image searches, does not contain the image in the claim and fails to corroborate the assertion that the image depicts a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. The search results discuss the conflict in Gaza, the presence of tanks, and the impact on civilians, but do not support the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
