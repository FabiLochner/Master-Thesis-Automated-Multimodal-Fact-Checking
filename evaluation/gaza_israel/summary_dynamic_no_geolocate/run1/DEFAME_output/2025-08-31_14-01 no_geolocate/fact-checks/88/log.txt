Useful result: From [Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/global/story/iran-rejects-allegations-against-quds-force-commander-esmail-qaani-as-fake-news-2616700-2024-10-14): 
Content: India Today published an article on October 14, 2024, about Iran rejecting allegations against Esmail Qaani. <image:10653>

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, as confirmed by multiple sources, including a post on Nairaland. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he is disguised in a hijab due to fear of Israeli bombing.

So, the overall veracity is: false
