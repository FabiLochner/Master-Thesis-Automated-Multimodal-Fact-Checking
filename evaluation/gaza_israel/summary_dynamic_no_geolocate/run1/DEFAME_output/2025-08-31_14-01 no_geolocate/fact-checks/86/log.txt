The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim, which shows military ships at sea, was taken in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, and is related to the exercise Baltic Operations 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). Therefore, the image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the IDF.

So, the overall veracity is: false
