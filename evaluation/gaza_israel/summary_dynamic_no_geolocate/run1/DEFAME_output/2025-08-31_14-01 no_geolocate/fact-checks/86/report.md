### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. sent additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran, according to the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo)). The Pentagon also announced the deployment of additional Navy warships to the Middle East to increase support for the defense of Israel ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/)). The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower was mentioned in the Reuters article. ![image 12897](media/2025-08-31_15-04-1756652677-298095.jpg), ![image 12898](media/2025-08-31_15-04-1756652677-581892.jpg), ![image 12899](media/2025-08-31_15-04-1756652683-012615.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image in the claim shows military ships at sea. However, the reverse image search reveals that the image was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea, and is related to the exercise Baltic Operations 2024. Therefore, the image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image was taken in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, not in August 2024 near Lebanon. The image is also not related to supporting the IDF. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim, which shows military ships at sea, was taken in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, and is related to the exercise Baltic Operations 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). Therefore, the image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the IDF.
