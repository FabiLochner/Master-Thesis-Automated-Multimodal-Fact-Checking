Content: The Times of Israel reports that Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia Avraham Neguise was removed from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa. Neguise has served as ambassador to Ethiopia since August 2024. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926): 
Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on April 7, 2025, stating that Israel’s ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference on the Rwandan genocide. <image:k> The article mentions that Neguise has been Israel’s ambassador to Ethiopia since August 2024.

The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from a conference, this was not a formal expulsion by the Ethiopian government. Furthermore, on April 2, 2025, the ambassador expressed a commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, as reported by the Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) and Fana Media Corporation S.C.

So, the overall veracity is: false
