## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Wikipedia, there was an attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, in Pennsylvania, by Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shot Trump with an AR-15-style rifle. The Secret Service had increased Trump's security due to intelligence indicating Iran was plotting to assassinate him. Conspiracy theories spread on social media after the shooting.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The United States has provided significant financial support to Israel, including at least $22.76 billion since October 7, 2023, with $17.9 billion allocated for military operations in Gaza, according to Brown University ([https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIsrael](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIsrael)). Wikipedia discusses US support for Israel in the Gaza war, including the debate over arms transfers and the Antisemitism Awareness Act ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war)).

Anadolu Agency discusses the financial implications of a potential conflict between Israel and Iran, including the costs of US military operations, such as a hypothetical operation involving 125 aircraft and expensive ammunition, which could cost between $1 billion and $2 billion (<image:k>) ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Iranian government official allegedly orchestrated a plot to assassinate Donald Trump. The plot also involved the killings of two Jewish-Americans. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans.

The evidence confirms that the US provides financial support to Israel, including military aid. It also mentions the potential financial implications of a conflict between Israel and Iran, including the costs of US military operations. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel wants American money to fund a war with Iran or American servicemen to fight it.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The first part of the claim is not supported by the evidence. The second part of the claim is not explicitly supported, but the evidence does show that the US provides financial support to Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that an Iranian government official was allegedly involved in a plot to assassinate Donald Trump, which also involved the killings of two Jewish-Americans. However, the claim that the plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans is not supported by the evidence. The evidence confirms that the US provides financial support to Israel, but it does not explicitly state that Israel wants American money to fund a war with Iran or American servicemen to fight it.

The claim is partially false because the first part of the claim is demonstrably false, and the second part is not explicitly supported by the evidence. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially false. While there was an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, the evidence does not support the assertion that it was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Additionally, the evidence confirms that the US provides financial support to Israel, but it does not explicitly state that Israel wants American money to fund a war with Iran or American servicemen to fight it.
