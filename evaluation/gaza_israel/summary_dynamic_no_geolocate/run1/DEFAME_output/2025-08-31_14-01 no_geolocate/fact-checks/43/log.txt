Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html): 
Content: The Yahoo article fact-checks the quote "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine." attributed to Anthony Bourdain. The article states that there is no credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement. The oldest version of the quote found with Bourdain's name attached was from July 2021. Similar statements without Bourdain's name were found dating back to 2013. The article mentions Bourdain's visit to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for a CNN show episode, which resulted in noteworthy comments and tweets regarding Palestinians. <image:12665> The article also includes a photo of Anthony Bourdain.

The claim 'Anthony Bourdain once said, 'Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Anthony Bourdain made the statement is not supported by evidence. A fact-check from Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html)) indicates that there is no credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement, with the earliest attribution to him appearing in July 2021.

So, the overall veracity is: false
