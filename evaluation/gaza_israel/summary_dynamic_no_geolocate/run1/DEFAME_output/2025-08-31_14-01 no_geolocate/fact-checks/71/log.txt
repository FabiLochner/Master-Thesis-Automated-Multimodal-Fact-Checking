Useful result: From [Source](https://en.haberler.com/in-syria-an-abandoned-tank-has-become-a-fruit-and-2027395/): Found exact image on website with title: In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
Content: The search result from Haberler.com shows an image of a tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand in Syria. The article is dated December 15, 2024. <image:2101> The article mentions clashes between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The image shows the tank after it was abandoned by regime forces.

The claim '<image:43> This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor.' is false.
Justification: The image shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, used as a fruit stand in Syria, not Gaza. This is confirmed by a fact-check from [AOL](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html) and a reverse image search that found the image on a website with the title "In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand".

So, the overall veracity is: false
