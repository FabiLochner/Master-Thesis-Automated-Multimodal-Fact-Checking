## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the use of genetic tests in Israel, particularly in relation to immigration and determining Jewish identity. One source, a paper titled "Genetic citizenship: DNA testing and the Israeli Law of Return" by Ian V. McGonigle and Lauren W. Herman, explores the historical and legal context of Jewishness and immigration rights in Israel, raising questions about the impact of Jewish genetics on Israeli law and society (<image:k>). Another source from Harvard University discusses the use of genetic tests in Israel to determine whether potential immigrants are Jewish, published in 2015 by Oxford University Press (<image:k>). Additionally, a nature.com article discusses a bill proposing stringent restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel, passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Instead, it is used in specific contexts, such as immigration and determining Jewish identity. Furthermore, there are discussions and legislative actions regarding the regulation and restriction of genetic information, implying that DNA testing is permissible but subject to legal frameworks.

The provided sources highlight the use of DNA testing in Israel, particularly in the context of immigration and Jewish identity. The existence of a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information further supports the idea that DNA testing is not illegal but is subject to regulation.

To definitively verify the claim, information on the specific legality of DNA testing for various purposes (e.g., medical, ancestry) is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/): 
Content: The search result from pz-law.co.il discusses the use of DNA tests for repatriation to Israel, specifically to prove Jewishness for immigration purposes. It states that DNA tests can be used if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. The article also mentions that the results of DNA tests from other laboratories may not be recognized, and it is recommended to consult with a lawyer regarding the legitimacy of such tests. The article was published on the website of a law firm.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes to establish Jewish identity. The pz-law.co.il source confirms that DNA tests can be used for repatriation if the applicant has Israeli relatives. This suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but its use may be subject to specific regulations and requirements, especially concerning the recognition of test results from different laboratories.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. It is used in specific contexts, such as immigration, and is subject to regulations. The provided sources confirm the use of DNA tests for repatriation to Israel, specifically to prove Jewishness for immigration purposes.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a law firm's website ([pz-law.co.il](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)), indicates that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes to establish Jewish identity. While regulations and restrictions may apply, the practice itself is not illegal.
