## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include articles discussing Keir Starmer's statements and actions related to the situation in Gaza. One article from map.org.uk, published on October 30, 2024, reports that Starmer stated that Israel is exterminating Palestinians in Gaza, but does not mention any boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. Another article from The Guardian, published on October 6, 2024, discusses Starmer's call for a ceasefire in Gaza. A BBC article from June 4, 2024, mentions the pressure on Starmer to take stronger action against Israel, including sanctions. ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 1011](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006106-695473.jpg), ![image 1012](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006107-233228.jpg), ![image 1010](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006104-876764.jpg), ![image 1023](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006112-822136.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While Keir Starmer has made statements regarding the situation in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and stating that Israel is exterminating Palestinians, none of the provided articles mention a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. The BBC article mentions pressure for stronger action, including sanctions, but not a complete boycott.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer has made statements about the situation in Gaza, but there is no mention of a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results from various news sources, including articles from [map.org.uk](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east), do not support the claim that Keir Starmer stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel. While Starmer has commented on the conflict in Gaza, no evidence of such a boycott was found.
