Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/elderly-palestinian-woman-recounts-terrifying-attack-by-israeli-army-dog-in-gaza/3262376): 
Content: Anadolu Agency published an article on June 30, 2024, about a 70-year-old Palestinian woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, who was attacked by an Israeli army dog in Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp. The article states that the dog had a camera on its back. The article includes a photo of the woman. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://pchrgaza.org/israeli-military-dog-attacked-me-while-asleep-and-viciously-bit-my-shoulder/): 
Content: The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) published an article on July 7, 2024, detailing an incident where an Israeli military dog attacked an elderly Palestinian woman while she was asleep, biting her shoulder. The article includes a photo of the woman with her injured arm <image:10860>. The incident occurred in May 2024. The article also mentions a video of the attack captured by a camera mounted on the dog.

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: While there were reports of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women in June 2024, the image in question could not be verified as authentic. Reverse image searches and other searches did not yield any results confirming the image's authenticity, despite confirming similar incidents, including one captured on video by a camera mounted on a dog.

So, the overall veracity is: false
