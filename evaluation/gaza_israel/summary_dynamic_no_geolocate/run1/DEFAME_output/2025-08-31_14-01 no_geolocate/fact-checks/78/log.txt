The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), evidence from Reuters indicates that Netanyahu was in Jerusalem, Israel, on that date, not in Poland.

So, the overall veracity is: false
