Useful result: From [Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf): 
Content: The JINSA report, "Erdogan Calls for Israel's Destruction," dated April 23, 2025, details Erdogan's anti-Israel rhetoric.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence): 
Content: PBS News published an article on July 23, 2025, stating that Syria requested Turkey's support to strengthen its defense capabilities following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention. <image:12815> The article mentions that Turkey was working towards providing training, advisory services, and technical support. It also mentions that tensions escalated in southern Syria, leading to Israeli airstrikes. The article also discusses the U.S. position and Turkey's stance on the SDF. The article mentions that in April, Israel struck five cities in Syria.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: Based on the evidence, while Turkish President Erdogan made anti-Israel statements in March 2025 and Turkey was critical of Israel's actions in Syria, there is no direct evidence to support the claim that he urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The JINSA report ([https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html](https://my.rusi.org/resource/turkey-navigates-an-escalating-israeliran-rivalry.html)) details Erdogan's anti-Israel rhetoric, but does not mention any such urging.

So, the overall veracity is: false
