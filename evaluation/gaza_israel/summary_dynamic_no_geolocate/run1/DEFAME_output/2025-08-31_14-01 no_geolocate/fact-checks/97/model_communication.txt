United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

## Claim
Claim: "The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war."

## Actions

web_search("US draft Israel-Hamas war 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:1>). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

The United Nations published a press release on November 20, 2024, reporting that the Security Council failed to adopt a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a US veto. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also called for the release of hostages and humanitarian aid.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN regarding the conflict, specifically its veto of a ceasefire resolution.

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)

 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)

At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:1>). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

The United Nations published a press release on November 20, 2024, reporting that the Security Council failed to adopt a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a US veto. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also called for the release of hostages and humanitarian aid.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN regarding the conflict, specifically its veto of a ceasefire resolution.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

Content: "He [told CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-terror-attack/)
 in an interview in February of last year that once Israel invaded Rafah in southern Gaza, “the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion.”

Now, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war.

But that operation also targets a city that is home to more than a million people, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza.

More than 22 months since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, over 2 million people in Gaza have been struggling with severe hunger, disease and displacement amid Israel’s siege.

Cases of child malnutrition have tripled across Gaza in “less than six months,” according to the United Nations, as humanitarian workers [urged Israel](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fpress-releases%2F2025%2F08%2Fgaza-israel-must-restore-un-humanitarian-system-stave-starvation-say-un&data=05%7C02%7Cjerome.taylor%40cnn.com%7Cac449314fcdd4420e59b08dde02dbaa9%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638913209256057834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZFc6p7J7iZRcGh9Y8O%2BDrA9RqOX7abUnaTHPbP56Osg%3D&reserved=0)
 to lift severe restrictions on aid entering the besieged enclave.

Nearly 1 in 3 children are malnourished in Gaza City, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in what he called a “a man-made, preventable starvation”.

Netanyahu’s government have repeatedly denied that starvation is rife in the enclave.

Jerusalem  — 

As the earliest stages of a [massive assault](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.

The takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/09/middleeast/nentanyahu-israel-gaza-analysis-intl)
 said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000.

Those plans have sparked growing condemnation [both internationally and domestically](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 over fears that the spiraling humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza will worsen – and that the lives of the remaining hostages will be further at risk from an expanded military operation.

The Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig. And even this won’t destroy Hamas.”

The Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military also said it has begun warning medical officials and international aid organizations in northern Gaza to plan for mass evacuation and displacement of the Palestinian population ahead of the planned Gaza City takeover.

The forced evacuation of the healthcare system risks worsening an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis gripping the besieged territory.

An Israeli military official told CNN that there will be “several steps” before Israeli ground forces move into the city. To continue fighting what has become the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.

But it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.

Defrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. “The war is over a year ago,” said Halutz, describing the current plan as having “no logic.” The retired general was careful not to call on Israelis to refuse to serve, but he encouraged reservists to “act according to his conscience, to his set of rules.”

Netanyahu promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. The IDF has begun preparing for the city’s evacuation by sending in more tents for displaced Palestinians, but evacuation warnings have not yet been issued.

When Israel’s security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.

After nearly [two years of war](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gaza-war-expansion-explainer-intl)
, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.

A new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40% of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13% were more motivated."

([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/))


### Evidence from `web_search`
The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war by providing care packages and programs. The Pentagon announced on October 16 that 2,000 U.S. service members have been placed on heightened alert for potential deployment. An article from CNN, published on August 20, 2025, discusses Israel's plans to call up tens of thousands of reservists for a military operation in Gaza City (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>).

One source states that there is no US military draft.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US has not reinstituted the draft. While there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, and the US is involved in the Israel-Hamas war, there is no evidence to support the claim that the draft was reinstituted in 2024. A source explicitly states that there is no US military draft.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while the US is involved in the Israel-Hamas war, there is no evidence to support the claim that the draft was reinstituted in 2024. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN regarding the conflict and discussions about the possibility of a draft, but no evidence confirms the claim.

`false`

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)
 to organizations funding relief in Israel and Palestine.

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

After the video went viral on social media, the woman, Daulat Abdallah Altanana, was compared to Little Red Riding Hood and the dog to the wolf. "He dragged me from the bedroom to the door and I was injured in my hand," said the woman who also claimed to have been displaced from her home during the war.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog. 

### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/israeli-military-dog-attacked-me-while-asleep-and-viciously-bit-my-shoulder/#respond)

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."
