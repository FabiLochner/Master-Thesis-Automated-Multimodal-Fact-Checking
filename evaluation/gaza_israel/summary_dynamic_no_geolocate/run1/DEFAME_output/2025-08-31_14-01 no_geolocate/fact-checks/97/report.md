## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News published an article on November 20, 2024, stating that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution demanding an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Security Council Report published on November 19, 2024, discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.

The United Nations published a press release on November 20, 2024, reporting that the Security Council failed to adopt a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza due to a US veto. The resolution, supported by 14 Council members, also called for the release of hostages and humanitarian aid.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN regarding the conflict, specifically its veto of a ceasefire resolution.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on conscription in the United States discusses the history of the draft, including during World War I and the Vietnam War, and mentions the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the end of the draft in 1973. It also mentions a 2007 article discussing the improbability of the draft returning. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States))

War on the Rocks published an article on August 8, 2024, discussing the possibility of a draft in the US, mentioning debates about conscription in other countries and the Selective Service System, and noting public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/))


### Evidence from `web_search`
The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war by providing care packages and programs. The Pentagon announced on October 16 that 2,000 U.S. service members have been placed on heightened alert for potential deployment. An article from CNN, published on August 20, 2025, discusses Israel's plans to call up tens of thousands of reservists for a military operation in Gaza City (![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg)).

One source states that there is no US military draft.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US has not reinstituted the draft. While there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, and the US is involved in the Israel-Hamas war, there is no evidence to support the claim that the draft was reinstituted in 2024. A source explicitly states that there is no US military draft.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while the US is involved in the Israel-Hamas war, there is no evidence to support the claim that the draft was reinstituted in 2024. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN regarding the conflict and discussions about the possibility of a draft, but no evidence confirms the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While the US is involved in the conflict, and there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, a source explicitly states that there is no US military draft ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)).
