## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with representatives of the Israeli Embassy. This event occurred in February 2023, not September 2024. The evidence also confirms that Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government in May 2024, citing the ongoing war in Gaza. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date and the context of the event.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate because the image was taken in February 2023, not September 2024. Additionally, the claim mentions the ongoing Gaza war, which is not directly related to the event depicted in the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with Israeli representatives in February 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-732077). This event occurred before the date mentioned in the claim and before Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government in May 2024, as reported by [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/barcelona-city-council-votes-to-cut-ties-with-israel-over-gaza-war/).
