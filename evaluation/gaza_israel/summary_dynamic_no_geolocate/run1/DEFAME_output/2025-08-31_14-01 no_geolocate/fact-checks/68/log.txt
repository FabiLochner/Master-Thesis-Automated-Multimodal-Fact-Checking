Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/low-airplanes-series-blasts-heard-syrian-capital-witnesses-say-2025-02-25/): 
Content: Reuters reports that on February 25, 2025, Israeli warplanes hit a town south of Syria's capital and the southern province of Daraa. The article mentions strikes on Kisweh, approximately 20 kilometers south of Damascus. The Israeli military stated that it attacked military targets in southern Syria. The article was written by Timour Azhari, Khalil Ashawi, and Mahmoud Hasano in Damascus, Seteven Scheer in Jerusalem and Jaidaa Taha in Cairo. The article was published on February 25, 2025.

The claim '<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were Israeli strikes in southern Syria in February 2025, including Kisweh ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/low-airplanes-series-blasts-heard-syrian-capital-witnesses-say-2025-02-25/)), the image's origin and connection to the specific event described in the claim remain unverified. The image has been used in other contexts, such as an interview about the media landscape in Syria and a report about an Israeli air attack on Damascus on December 2, 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
