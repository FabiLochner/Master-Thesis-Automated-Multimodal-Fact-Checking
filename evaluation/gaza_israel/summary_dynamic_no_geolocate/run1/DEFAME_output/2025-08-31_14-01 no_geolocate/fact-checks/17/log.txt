Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_the_MV_Maersk_Hangzhou): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Attacks on the MV Maersk Hangzhou" states that on December 30, 2023, Houthi forces attacked the Maersk Hangzhou in the Gulf of Aden. The article also mentions the Red Sea crisis and Operation Prosperity Guardian. The article lists several attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including the MV Maersk Hangzhou. It also mentions the 2024 Houthi drone attack on Israel and the July 2024 Israeli attack on Yemen.

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is true.
Justification: The claim is partially true. Multiple sources, including Reuters and PBS News, confirm that a U.S.-flagged container ship, the Maersk Sentosa, was targeted in the Gulf of Aden by Houthi rebels in July 2024 ([https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/) and [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/houthi-rebels-target-u-s-flagged-container-ship-off-coast-of-yemen](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/houthi-rebels-target-u-s-flagged-container-ship-off-coast-of-yemen)). However, the claim also includes a quote from a Maersk spokesperson, which is not directly verified by the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: true
