Content: The search result from NDTV.com discusses the Bibas family, including Shiri Bibas and her two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The article, published on December 4, 2023, reports that Hamas claimed the family was dead, while Israeli authorities had not confirmed this. <image:12631> The article also mentions the family's hopes for their return and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their fate.

The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While the BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family, the title was "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family," which contradicts the claim's title. The reverse image search confirms this discrepancy.

So, the overall veracity is: false
