Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/myanmar-earthquake-religious-cultural-sites): 
Content: The National Geographic article shows images of the ruins after the Myanmar earthquake. <image:2913>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. Multiple sources confirm a 7.9-magnitude earthquake occurred in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as reported by ScienceDirect ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772467025000399](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772467025000399)) and CGTN ([https://www.cgtn.com/special/Live-updates-M7-9-quake-strikes-Myanmar.html](https://www.cgtn.com/special/Live-updates-M7-9-quake-strikes-Myanmar.html)). However, the image search did not return the image provided in the claim, making it impossible to verify if the image depicts the aftermath of the earthquake.

So, the overall veracity is: false
