Content: The Times of India published an article on December 10, 2024, reporting that Greta Thunberg shouted "F\*\*k Israel" at a German rally. <image:k> The article mentions that Thunberg's comments sparked backlash and criticism.

The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: The image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Fuck Israel" is authentic and has been used in articles discussing her support for Gaza, as evidenced by articles from The Ecologist ([https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza](https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza)) and The Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greta-thunberg-laughs-as-she-shouts-fk-israel-at-german-rally-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116164532.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greta-thunberg-laughs-as-she-shouts-fk-israel-at-german-rally-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116164532.cms)). However, the claim that the image is from November 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
