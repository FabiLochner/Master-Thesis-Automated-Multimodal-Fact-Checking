## Elaboration
The image (![image 29](media/45.jpg)) is present in an article from The Ecologist published on November 3, 2023, discussing Greta Thunberg's support for Gaza. The Times of India reported that Thunberg shouted "F\*\*k Israel" at a German rally. The claim states the image is from November 2024, which is not supported by the evidence.

Based on the evidence, the image is likely authentic, but the date is incorrect.


## Final Judgement
The image is authentic and has been used in articles discussing Greta Thunberg's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. However, the claim that the image is from November 2024 is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`
