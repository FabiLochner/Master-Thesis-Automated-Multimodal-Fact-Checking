### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss an attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, in Pennsylvania during a campaign rally. The perpetrator, Thomas Matthew Crooks, used an AR-15-style rifle, wounding Trump and killing one other person. The event prompted responses from President Joe Biden and the Secret Service, as well as an investigation.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-biden-trump-07-13-24)) mentions Trump's plan to travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and includes a statement from Trump on Truth Social. C-SPAN ([https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?Trump-Rally-Shooting](https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?Trump-Rally-Shooting)) provides videos and news clips related to the event, including information about the investigation and reactions from public figures. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania)) details the event, including the weapon used, the number of deaths and injuries, and the response to the event.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim cannot be determined based on the available evidence. Additional information is needed to verify the specific statement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East. The post, made on July 25, 2024, does not mention Israel or Hamas by name, but warns of severe consequences if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025. ![image 11568](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-192813.jpg), ![image 11567](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636512-862768.jpg), ![image 11569](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-524886.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, the provided search results from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)) show that the post did not mention Israel or Hamas and instead focused on the release of hostages.

Therefore, the claim that Trump posted "I hope that America obliterates Israel" on July 25, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the search results do not contain the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim. Further investigation reveals a post by Trump on the same date, but it does not contain the statement in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an assassination attempt on him on July 13, 2024, the evidence, including a search result from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)), does not support the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim.
