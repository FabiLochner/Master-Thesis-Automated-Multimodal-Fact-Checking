Content: The Associated Press reports that the Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war passed 55,000 as of June 2025. The article mentions that at least 21 people were killed on their way to aid distribution sites. The article also mentions that the Gaza Health Ministry said that women and children make up more than half the 55,000 dead. <image:214>, <image:215>, <image:216>, <image:217>, <image:218>, <image:219>. The article was published on July 16, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261): 
Content: The UN News article, published on March 19, 2025, reports that at least one UN staff member was killed and five others injured in an explosion at a UN guesthouse in Deir al-Balah. The article states that the Israeli military denied attacking the compound, which was known to them and "deconflicted." The Secretary-General condemned the attacks. The article also mentions that the incident brings the number of UN colleagues killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, to at least 280. <image:1>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-strike-hits-near-gaza-medical-centre-truce-talks-continue-2025-07-10/): 
Content: Reuters reports on an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah on July 10, 2025, near a medical center, resulting in the deaths of 10 children and 6 adults. <image:224> The article also mentions that several rounds of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have failed to produce a breakthrough since the Israeli military resumed its campaign in March.

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence confirms Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, with casualties including the death of a UN staff member, as reported by a [UN News article](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160092). However, the exact number of Palestinian deaths in March is not explicitly confirmed by the provided sources.

So, the overall veracity is: false
