Content: The Statista Research Department published a report on June 30, 2025, discussing statistics and facts about the Gaza Strip. The report mentions a total population of 2.1 million.

Useful result: From [Source](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza): 
Content: The World Population Review estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth. The population grew by 22,771 in the last year. The source is the UN World Urbanization Prospects.

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Gaza's population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including CNN and The Times of Israel, report a 6% decrease in population since that date, citing factors such as casualties and emigration due to the ongoing conflict. The claim's basis on growth forecasts from August 2023 does not align with the observed population decline.

So, the overall veracity is: false
