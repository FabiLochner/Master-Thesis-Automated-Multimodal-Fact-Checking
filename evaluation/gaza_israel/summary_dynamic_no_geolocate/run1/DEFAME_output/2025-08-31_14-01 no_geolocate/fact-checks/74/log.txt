Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216): 
Content: The NBC News live blog reports a drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, Israel, on Saturday morning.

The claim 'Netanyahu’s son Yair was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024 that targeted the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea, Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), the sources state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu, thus contradicting the claim that he was killed in the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
