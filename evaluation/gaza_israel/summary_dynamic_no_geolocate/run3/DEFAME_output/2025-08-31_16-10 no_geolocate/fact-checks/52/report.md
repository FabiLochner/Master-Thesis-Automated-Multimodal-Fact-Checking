## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with about 100,000 Palestinians leaving since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks <image:k>, <image:j>. The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) also states a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), which indicates a decline of approximately 160,000 people ![image 1646](media/2025-07-20_10-39-1753007954-541099.jpg).

Conversely, the New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023 ![image 1632](media/2025-07-20_10-38-1753007935-200533.jpg). This estimate is based on growth forecasts from August 2023.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a decrease of 6%.

However, the New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) claims an increase of 2.02%, based on growth forecasts from August 2023.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting reports.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. Some sources indicate a population decrease in Gaza since October 7, 2023, while another source claims an increase. The claim is therefore not verifiable. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not verifiable. While the New York City Financial Policy Association ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) states an increase of 2.02%, based on growth forecasts, CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a 6% decrease in population since October 7, 2023.
