Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/a-visual-guide-to-the-destruction-of-gaza): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, detailing the destruction in Gaza. The article states that nine in ten homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged. It also mentions that satellite imagery shows large portions of neighborhoods in Rafah have been almost completely demolished. The article includes drone footage and satellite imagery. <image:13201>, <image:13202>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68006607): 
Content: The BBC article, published on January 30, 2024, states that more than half of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since October 7, 2023. <image:13740> shows the increasing damage across Gaza from October 2023 to January 2024. The analysis suggests between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed, which is between 50% and 61% of Gaza's buildings. The article also mentions the destruction of residential areas, shopping streets, universities, and farmlands.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza): 
Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on January 20, 2025, discusses the destruction in Gaza after more than 15 months of Israeli bombings. It states that at least 60 percent of all buildings in Gaza have been destroyed, and approximately 92 percent of housing units are destroyed or damaged. The article includes multiple images of destroyed buildings and rubble in Gaza. <image:k>, <image:13201>, <image:13202>.

The claim '<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence from multiple sources, including the Guardian and Al Jazeera, confirms widespread destruction in Gaza, with a significant percentage of buildings damaged or destroyed. Image searches also show that images of destroyed buildings were published in December 2024, making the date plausible. However, the claim's assertion that the image shows Gaza "completely destroyed" is not directly supported by the evidence, and the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
