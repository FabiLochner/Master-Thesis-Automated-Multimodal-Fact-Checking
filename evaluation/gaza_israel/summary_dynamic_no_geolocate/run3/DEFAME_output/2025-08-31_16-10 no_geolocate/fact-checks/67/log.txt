Useful result: From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: The article from Madamasr.com, published on August 28, 2025, discusses the political situation in Syria, including the role of Turkey, the U.S., and Israel. It mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on May 24, where they discussed the Kurdish forces. The article also mentions that on March 16, 2025, Trump promised to lift sanctions on the Syrian regime. The article also mentions that on July 16, Israel began bombing Syrian forces in Suwayda.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check reveals that while Turkish President Erdogan and U.S. President Trump discussed Syria in March 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel during that time. The search results show that Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" on March 30, 2025, and that the Turkish Foreign Minister criticized Israel's involvement in Syria in a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey on May 15, 2025, but the specific request to control Israel is not confirmed. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.

So, the overall veracity is: false
