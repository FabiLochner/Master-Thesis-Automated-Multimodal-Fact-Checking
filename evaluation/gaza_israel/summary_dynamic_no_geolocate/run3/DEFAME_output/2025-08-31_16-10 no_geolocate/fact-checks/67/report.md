## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from [en.majalla.com](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023, a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025, and Israeli strikes on Syrian government troops in July 2025 (![image 11686](media/2025-08-31_10-48-1756637288-250779.jpg), ![image 11685](media/2025-08-31_10-48-1756637286-795762.jpg)). Another article from [mondediplo.com](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, and that Greece made strides in the global fight against antisemitism in January 2025 (![image 1](media/0.jpg)).

The Times of Israel ([www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (![image 11692](media/2025-08-31_10-49-1756637373-724529.jpg)). The article also mentions that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025, and that there were talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025. The evidence also mentions a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025.

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information on the relationship between Turkey, the U.S., Israel, and Syria in 2025.  Reuters ([www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/)) reports that Turkish President Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Trump on March 16, 2025, discussing efforts to restore stability in Syria (![image 11695](media/2025-08-31_10-50-1756637416-710330.jpg)). JINSA ([jinsa.org](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) mentions that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated."

Levant24 ([levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses a meeting on May 15, 2025, between the US Ambassador to Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Minister, where the latter criticized Israel's involvement in Syria (![image 11694](media/2025-08-31_10-50-1756637409-668024.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Trump on March 16, 2025, discussing Syria. It also shows that Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" on March 30, 2025. Furthermore, the Turkish Foreign Minister criticized Israel's involvement in Syria in a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey on May 15, 2025.

While the evidence confirms a discussion between Erdogan and Trump about Syria in March 2025, it does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel. However, the evidence does suggest that Turkey was critical of Israel's actions in Syria.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, as there was communication between Erdogan and Trump regarding Syria in March 2025. However, the evidence does not directly confirm the specific request to control Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Middle East Institute ([mei.edu](https://www.mei.edu/publications/trump-should-build-momentum-syria-and-help-prevent-turkey-israel-clash)) published an analysis on May 14, 2025, discussing the risk of a military confrontation between Turkey and Israel in Syria (![image 11695](media/2025-08-31_10-50-1756637416-710330.jpg)). Madamasr.com ([madamasr.com](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) discusses the political situation in Syria, including the role of Turkey, the U.S., and Israel, mentioning a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on May 24, and that Trump promised to lift sanctions on the Syrian regime on March 16, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence reveals that on March 16, 2025, Trump promised to lift sanctions on the Syrian regime. Also, on March 16, 2025, Erdogan and Trump discussed Syria. The evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there were discussions between Turkish President Erdogan and U.S. President Trump regarding Syria in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check reveals that while Turkish President Erdogan and U.S. President Trump discussed Syria in March 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel during that time. The search results show that Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" on March 30, 2025, and that the Turkish Foreign Minister criticized Israel's involvement in Syria in a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey on May 15, 2025, but the specific request to control Israel is not confirmed. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.
