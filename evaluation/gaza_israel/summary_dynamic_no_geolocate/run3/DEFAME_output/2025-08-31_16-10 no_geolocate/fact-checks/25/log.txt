Useful result: From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-keir-starmer-israel-gaza-city-netanyahu-plan/): 
Content: The article from Politico.eu reports that Keir Starmer condemned Israel's military escalation in Gaza. It mentions a statement by Starmer, but does not mention any boycott of diplomatic relations. The article is dated August 2025.

The claim 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Keir Starmer has called for a ceasefire and expressed concerns about the situation in Gaza, there is no evidence from sources like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east), [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/24/uks-starmer-calls-for-de-escalation-between-israel-and-hezbollah), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3618lnj2ygo) to support the assertion that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
