The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is true.
Justification: The claim is supported by the evidence. The image in the claim is present in the Al Jazeera and Getty Images articles, which document the war in Gaza ([https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/15/israels-war-on-gaza-15-months-15-pictures](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/15/israels-war-on-gaza-15-months-15-pictures) and [https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gaza-war](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gaza-war)). The BBC article discusses the search for missing people in Gaza ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6269pd5y2ko](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6269pd5y2ko)), and the image search results show other images of mothers and children in Gaza.
