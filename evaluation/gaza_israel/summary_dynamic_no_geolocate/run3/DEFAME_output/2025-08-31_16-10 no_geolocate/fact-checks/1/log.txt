Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sinchew.com.my/news/20250404/nation/6425552): Found exact image on website with title: 网上不实照片真多加沙旧图变缅地震照- 国内 - 星洲日报
Content: The article from Sin Chew Daily, published on April 4, 2025, addresses the spread of a photo online, which was falsely claimed to be from the Myanmar earthquake. The article states that the image <image:2> is actually from the Gaza region and was circulating on social media as early as March 20, 2025, before the Myanmar earthquake on March 28, 2025.

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image provided in the claim, which purports to show the aftermath of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been circulating on social media since March 20, 2025, and is unrelated to the earthquake. Reverse image searches show that the image was falsely associated with the Gaza region.

So, the overall veracity is: false
