Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc): 
Content: NPR published an article on August 23, 2024, by Jaclyn Diaz, stating that Harris met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and said at the time that she held an “unwavering commitment to Israel,” but that she “will not be silent” about the humanitarian issues in Gaza. <image:13690>, <image:13691>, <image:13692>. The article also mentions that Harris said, "Let me be clear, I will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself."

The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Kamala Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the United States cannot be verified. While Harris expressed support for Israel around that time, including reaffirming Israel's right to defend itself and expressing an unwavering commitment to Israel's existence, the specific quote is not found in the provided sources ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
