Content: The Vanity Fair article, published in July 2015, discusses rising antisemitism in France, focusing on events in 2014 and early 2015. It mentions a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, where a swastika was painted on a statue and chants of "Death to the Jews" were heard. The article also covers the January 2015 Hyper Cacher attack and the broader context of increasing anti-Semitic incidents, including attacks on synagogues and schools. The article includes an image of a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, where a swastika was painted on a statue.

Content: The World Jewish Congress published an article on June 19, 2017, about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism. The article includes the image in the claim. <image:6999> The image shows a group of people with Palestinian flags and a swastika drawn on a monument.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/tags/adam-milstein): Found exact image on website with title: Adam Milstein | The Jerusalem Post
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article by Adam Milstein on July 27, 2023, discussing antisemitism in Europe. The article includes an image of a protest in Paris where a swastika was drawn on the base of the Statue de la République during a pro-Palestinian protest on July 26, 2014. <image:546154>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)), and not a protest against Le Pen's victory in 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
