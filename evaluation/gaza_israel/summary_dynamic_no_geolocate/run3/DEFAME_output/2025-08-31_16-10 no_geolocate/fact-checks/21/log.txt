Useful result: From [Source](https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/overview-of-president-trumps-executive-actions-on-global-health/): 
Content: The KFF.org article, published on August 15, 2025, and originally published on January 28, 2025, lists executive actions taken by President Trump. Two executive orders were issued on January 20, 2025: "Initial rescissions of Executive Orders and Actions" and "Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government." A memorandum was issued on January 24, 2025, regarding the reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy. The article does not mention any executive order related to UNRWA funding.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nafsa.org/executive-and-regulatory-actions-trump2admin): 
Content: NAFSA.org published an article on August 21, 2025, listing executive orders and actions during the Trump-Vance administration (January 20, 2025 - January 20, 2029). The article mentions several executive orders signed on January 20, 2025: Executive Order 14148, a Presidential Memorandum on a Hiring Freeze, Executive Order 14169, and Executive Order 14150. Executive Order 14169 is about reevaluating and realigning United States Foreign Aid.

The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding, the specific date of January 20, 2025, is not supported by the evidence. Additional searches confirm that Trump signed executive orders on that date, but none of them concerned UNRWA funding.

So, the overall veracity is: false
