## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The attack was carried out by Israel, according to a CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) and a CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) also mentions the assassination.

The sources do not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, in Tehran, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account may have enabled location tracking. The article cites a report by Sputnik. ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) ![image 13377](media/2025-08-31_16-04-1756656269-970149.jpg)

The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 17, 2025, claiming that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals in Iran, and that they previously killed Ismail Haniyeh the same way in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> CUFI discusses Hamas using WhatsApp to collect intelligence on IDF movements. ([https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/](https://cufi.org/issue/hamas-using-whatsapp-to-collect-intelligence-on-idf-movements/)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially supported but also contains uncertainties. One article mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)). Another article states that Iranian state media reported that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate individuals, including Haniyeh ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)).

However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The reports are unconfirmed, and the Jerusalem Post article cites Iranian state media, which may have a bias.

Further investigation is needed to confirm the specific methods used by Israeli intelligence and the role of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on March 6, 2025, discussing how the Israeli military is creating a ChatGPT-like tool using Palestinian surveillance data, and that Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit, is using AI to analyze intercepted communications ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance)). Human Rights Watch published an article on September 10, 2024, discussing the Israeli military's use of digital tools in Gaza, including mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)).

Truthout.org published an article on May 21, 2024, discussing reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings of Palestinians, mentioning the "Lavender" AI system, which allegedly identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)). The article also mentions that Israel may acquire WhatsApp data through informants, captured devices, and spyware. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the use of spyware, developed by Israeli companies, to target WhatsApp users. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal)) details the Pegasus scandal, where spyware was used to target journalists, activists, and government officials. NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)) report on Paragon Solutions, another Israeli company, targeting WhatsApp users with spyware, including journalists and civil society members. ![image 13377](media/2025-08-31_16-04-1756656269-970149.jpg) ![image 13957](media/2025-08-31_17-05-1756659949-312089.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence uses various methods to track individuals, including the use of AI to analyze intercepted communications and mobile phone location tracking ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance), [https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)). Furthermore, there are reports that Israel uses WhatsApp data in targeted killings, potentially through informants, captured devices, and spyware ([https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/](https://truthout.org/articles/report-indicates-israel-uses-whatsapp-data-in-targeted-killings-of-palestinians/)).

Specifically, the evidence indicates that Israeli companies have developed spyware to target WhatsApp users ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp_snooping_scandal), [https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/whatsapp-says-spyware-company-paragon-solutions-targeted-journalists-rcna190227), [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware)). While there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp, the use of spyware and the reported use of WhatsApp data in targeted killings suggest that it is plausible.

The claim is therefore plausible, but not definitively proven.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Tehran Times reported that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before his assassination, suggesting WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). The SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit reported on the assassination, but did not mention WhatsApp ([https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/)). <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides further support for the claim. The Tehran Times reported that Ismail Haniyeh's son stated that his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)). This, combined with previous evidence of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance and targeted killings, increases the plausibility of the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for his assassination on July 31, 2024, is plausible but not definitively proven. While there are unconfirmed reports suggesting spyware on Haniyeh's phone, accessed through WhatsApp, may have enabled location tracking, and evidence of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance, there is no direct confirmation. However, the Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination, increasing the plausibility.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is plausible but not definitively proven. While there are reports of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance and targeted killings, and the Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)), there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.
