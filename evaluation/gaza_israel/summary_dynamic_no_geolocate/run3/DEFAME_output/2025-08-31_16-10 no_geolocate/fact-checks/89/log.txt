Useful result: From [Source](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says): 
Content: The Tehran Times published an article on August 19, 2024, stating that Ismail Haniyeh's son mentioned that his father used WhatsApp shortly before his assassination. The article suggests that WhatsApp may have been involved in the assassination. The article also mentions that the Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31. <image:k>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/07/31/ismail-haniyehs-assassination/): 
Content: The SpecialEurasia OSINT Unit published a report on July 31, 2024, discussing the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran. The report states that Hamas blames Israel for the assassination. The report does not mention any information about Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The claim 'For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.' is false.
Justification: The claim is plausible but not definitively proven. While there are reports of Israeli use of spyware and WhatsApp data for surveillance and targeted killings, and the Tehran Times reported that Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp shortly before the assassination ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)), there is no direct confirmation that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

So, the overall veracity is: false
