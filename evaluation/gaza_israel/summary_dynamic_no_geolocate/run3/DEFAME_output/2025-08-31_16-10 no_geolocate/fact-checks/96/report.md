## Elaboration
The claim states that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed on July 6, 2024, at Al-Jaoni UN school. However, the evidence indicates that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 23, 2023, in their home in the Gaza Strip.

The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the date and location of the children's death.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli airstrike, but the date and location mentioned in the claim are incorrect. The claim misrepresents the circumstances of their death. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. According to multiple sources, including Al Jazeera and Press TV, Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 23, 2023, in their home in the Gaza Strip, not on July 6, 2024, at Al-Jaoni UN school as the claim states ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/11/25/715273/Humans-of-Gaza-Mayar-Bilal-inseparable-siblings](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/11/25/715273/Humans-of-Gaza-Mayar-Bilal-inseparable-siblings)).
