Useful result: From [Source](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2023/11/18/82751/): 
Content: Palinfo.com published an article on November 18, 2023, stating that Mayar and Bilal Hamida, children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida, were killed in Israeli airstrikes in October 2023 along with their mother. <image:11844>, <image:11842>, <image:11843>.

Justification: The claim is false. According to multiple sources, including Al Jazeera and Press TV, Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli airstrike on October 23, 2023, in their home in the Gaza Strip, not on July 6, 2024, at Al-Jaoni UN school as the claim states ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/11/25/715273/Humans-of-Gaza-Mayar-Bilal-inseparable-siblings](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2023/11/25/715273/Humans-of-Gaza-Mayar-Bilal-inseparable-siblings)).
