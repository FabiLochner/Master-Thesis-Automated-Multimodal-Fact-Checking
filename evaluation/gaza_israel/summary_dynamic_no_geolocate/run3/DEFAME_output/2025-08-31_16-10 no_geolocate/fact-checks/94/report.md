The image ![image 61](media/94.jpg) appears in a VOA News article from January 24, 2018, about Syria and Russia accusing the U.S. of lying about chemical weapons attacks. The image shows a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on January 22, 2018. The image also appears in a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report from October 16, 2024, discussing emerging trends in chemical weapons usage in the Middle East. The ABC News article from January 23, 2018, also includes the image and discusses the U.S. stance on chemical attacks in Syria.

## Elaboration
The image is from January 2018 and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face in a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack. The claim states the image is from July 2024 and shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war. The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is from January 2018 and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face in a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack. The claim states the image is from July 2024 and shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image's origin and context are misrepresented. The image is not from the Gaza war in July 2024, but from Syria in January 2018. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from January 2018 and shows a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant's face following a reported gas attack, as reported by [VOA News](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html) and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201). The claim misrepresents the image's origin and context, stating it is from the Gaza war in July 2024.
