## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR published an article on November 5, 2024, stating that Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replaced him with Israel Katz. The article also mentions protests across Israel. ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) ![image 13619](media/2025-08-31_16-28-1756657705-435429.jpg), ![image 13620](media/2025-08-31_16-28-1756657705-782305.jpg)

Al Jazeera published an article on October 8, 2024, stating that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant canceled a meeting with the US Secretary of Defense. The article mentions an Iranian missile attack on Israel last week and that Gallant was fired in 2023 by Netanyahu.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Yoav Gallant was the Defense Minister of Israel and was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. The Times of Israel published an article about the attack on October 1, 2024, including a photo of Gallant. Furthermore, Al Jazeera reported that Gallant canceled a meeting on October 8, 2024, and NPR reported that he was fired on November 5, 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was not killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. Multiple sources, including The Times of Israel, Al Jazeera, and NPR, provide information about Gallant's activities and status after the alleged attack. These sources show that Gallant was alive and active after the date of the attack.

`false`
