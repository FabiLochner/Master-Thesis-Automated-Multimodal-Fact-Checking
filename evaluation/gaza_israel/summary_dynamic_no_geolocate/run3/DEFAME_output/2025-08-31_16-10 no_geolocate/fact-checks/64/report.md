## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, was seen in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination (<image:k>). According to the IDF, Qaani is still alive (![image 13246](media/2025-08-31_15-47-1756655233-688764.jpg)).

Reports of Qaani being killed in Israeli airstrikes in June 2025 were not confirmed by Iranian authorities. A video from June 24, 2025, showed Qaani in Tehran, refuting the death reports (<image:k>).

The claim is demonstrably false because it is contradicted by evidence from multiple and reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a video and reports, shows that Esmail Qaani was in Tehran in June 2025, directly contradicting the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is in Israel.
