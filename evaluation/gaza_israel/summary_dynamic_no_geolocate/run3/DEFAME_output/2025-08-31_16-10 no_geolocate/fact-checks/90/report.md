## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics. In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul. ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg) <image:i> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics because he failed to make weight. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances. This is not explicitly a withdrawal, but rather a disqualification due to not making weight.

The provided evidence also mentions that this is not an isolated incident. In the Tokyo Olympics, another Algerian judoka, Fethi Nourine, withdrew to avoid a match against Butbul.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. While the Algerian judoka did not compete against the Israeli opponent, the reason was not a withdrawal but a failure to make weight, which led to disqualification.

`false`
