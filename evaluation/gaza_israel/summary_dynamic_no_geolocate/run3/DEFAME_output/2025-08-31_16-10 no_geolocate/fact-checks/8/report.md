## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 8](media/8.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 8](media/8.jpg) is found on multiple websites. One website, "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)", labels the image as "A picture of the raid that targeted the Al-Laylaki area a short while ago" and dates it October 22, 2024. Another website, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", also uses the image with the same caption.

The image is also found on "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)", which discusses the Israeli aggression against Gaza and mentions a drone and missile operation in April 2024.


## Elaboration
The image is associated with different events. One source dates the image to October 22, 2024, and labels it as a raid on the Al-Laylaki area. Another source mentions the image in the context of Israeli aggression against Gaza, with a drone and missile operation in April 2024.

The claim states the image shows attacks on October 26, 2024, which contradicts the evidence.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is associated with different events, including a raid on the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024, and Israeli aggression against Gaza in April 2024. The claim that the image shows attacks on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is associated with a raid on the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024, as indicated by the "[Islamic State (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)" and "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)" websites. The claim that the image depicts attacks on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the available evidence.
