Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the Majdal Shams attack that occurred on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights, where a rocket hit a soccer field, killing 12 Syrian Druze children and injuring at least 42 others.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054339/rocket-attack-on-israeli-controlled-golan-heights-kills-10-rescue-official-says): 
Content: NPR reports on a rocket attack on a soccer field in Majdal Shams on July 27, 2024, in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, which killed at least 10 people and wounded several others, including children. <image:13629> The Israeli military stated that Hezbollah was behind the rocket launch. The article also mentions that Hezbollah denied carrying out the attack. The article was published on July 27, 2024, by The Associated Press.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a rocket attack did occur on July 27, 2024, in Majdal Shams, killing children, the image provided is unrelated to the event. The image search results show a baby eating a strawberry, and the web search confirms the attack, but the image is not associated with the event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
