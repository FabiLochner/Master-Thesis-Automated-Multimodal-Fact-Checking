Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks" lists several 9/11 memorials, including the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem. The article also mentions memorials in Bremerton, Washington, Dover, Delaware, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, among others. The article does not explicitly state that the Jerusalem memorial is the only one outside the US.

The claim '<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US.' is false.
Justification: The image shows the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. However, contrary to the claim, this is not the only 9/11 memorial outside the US; there are multiple memorials in various countries, as evidenced by search results ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
