## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader)) reports that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024. The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)) also mentions the airstrikes in Beirut that killed Hassan Nasrallah.

The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/)) reports that an Israeli airstrike in Beirut targeted Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah, and the article mentions the strike occurred on September 27, 2024. The Washington Post also includes the image of the ring (![image 24](media/35.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. The Washington Post article includes the image of the ring and mentions the strike occurred on September 27, 2024.

The claim states the airstrike occurred on September 28, 2024. This discrepancy needs to be clarified.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the date of the airstrike is inconsistent.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, and the image of the ring is included in a news article about the event. However, there is a discrepancy in the date of the airstrike.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the date of the airstrike is inconsistent. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including NPR ([Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader)) and The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/lebanon-reels-from-israeli-bombardment-with-no-sign-of-respite)), confirm that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/28/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/)) includes the image of the ring in an article about the event. However, the date of the airstrike is inconsistent across sources, making the claim not entirely accurate.
