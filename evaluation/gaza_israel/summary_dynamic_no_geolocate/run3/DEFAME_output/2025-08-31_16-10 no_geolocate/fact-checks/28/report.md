## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On April 2, 2025, the Ethiopian News Agency ([Source](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848)) reported that the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressed Israel's commitment to strengthening ties with Ethiopia ![image 1](media/0.jpg). Fana Media Corporation S.C. ([Source](https://www.fanamc.com/english/israel-seeks-stronger-economic-people-ties-with-ethiopia-ambassador/)) also reported on the same day that the ambassador emphasized strengthening economic and social ties ![image 5051](media/2025-08-23_01-29-1755912546-305304.jpg).

The Wikipedia article "Ethiopiaâ€“Israel relations" ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia%E2%80%93Israel_relations)) discusses the diplomatic relations between the two countries, including the history of their relationship and the fact that Ethiopia broke diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973 <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on April 2, 2025, the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, was actively working to strengthen ties between the two countries. This contradicts the claim that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador in April 2025.


## Final Judgement
The search results from April 2025 show the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Abraham Negussie, expressing a commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries. This contradicts the claim that the ambassador was expelled.
