The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, saying "I hope that America obliterates Israel" cannot be verified. While evidence confirms Trump posted on Truth Social on that date and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024, no source provides the specific quote from the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
