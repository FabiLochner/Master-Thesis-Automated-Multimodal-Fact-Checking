### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. government is offering charter flights to help Americans leave Israel, with options to Athens or Frankfurt by air, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. Americans will be asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government. (![image 9577](media/2025-08-30_00-59-1756515584-362178.jpg)) The State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" for U.S. citizens and lawful residents out of Israel.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to U.S. citizens in Lebanon to relocate to safer areas and is assisting U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon. The U.S. government has also started "assisted departure flights" for U.S. citizens and lawful residents out of Israel. The evidence does not specify whether the U.S. government is flying Israeli citizens out of Israel.

The claim that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to pay for flights out of Lebanon is supported by the evidence. The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to verify this part of the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725): 
Content: ABC News reports that the State Department is arranging chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to sites in Europe, starting Friday, October 13, 2023. ![image 13713](media/2025-08-31_16-39-1756658355-175726.jpg). The State Department expects these flights to facilitate the safe departure of thousands of U.S. citizens per week. The article is authored by Justin Gomez and Shannon K. and was published on October 12, 2023.


## Elaboration
The U.S. government arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe starting October 13, 2023. The evidence does not mention flights for Israeli citizens. The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon and has arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to U.S. citizens in Lebanon and has arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel, starting in October 2023, to facilitate their departure amid the conflict with Israel and Hezbollah. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year.
