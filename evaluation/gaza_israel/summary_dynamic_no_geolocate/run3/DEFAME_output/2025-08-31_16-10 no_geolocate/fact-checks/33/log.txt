The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While there was an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the plot was orchestrated by an Iranian government official, not Jewish Americans, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department)) and BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28x187rmko](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28x187rmko)). The U.S. was involved in the Iran-Israel war, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Israel wants American money or servicemen to fight it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
