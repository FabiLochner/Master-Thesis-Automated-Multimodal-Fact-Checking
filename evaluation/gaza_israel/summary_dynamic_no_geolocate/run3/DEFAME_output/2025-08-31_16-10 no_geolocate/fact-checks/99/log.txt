Content: The search result from iStockphoto contains multiple images of elderly women with dogs <image:14005>, <image:14006>, <image:14007>, <image:14008>, <image:14009>, <image:14010>, <image:14011>, <image:14012>, <image:14013>, <image:14014>, <image:14015>, <image:14016>, <image:14017>, <image:14018>, <image:14019>. The images show elderly women with dogs in various settings.

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, and images of elderly women with dogs, the specific image in the claim was not found in the image or web searches.

So, the overall veracity is: false
