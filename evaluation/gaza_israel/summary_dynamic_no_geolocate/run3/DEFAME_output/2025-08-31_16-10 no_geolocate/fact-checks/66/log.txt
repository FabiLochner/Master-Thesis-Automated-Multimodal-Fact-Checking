The claim '<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in Pennsylvania, as confirmed by multiple sources, including the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/trump-zelenskyy-ukraine-feud-republicans-election-interference) and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y30244467o).
