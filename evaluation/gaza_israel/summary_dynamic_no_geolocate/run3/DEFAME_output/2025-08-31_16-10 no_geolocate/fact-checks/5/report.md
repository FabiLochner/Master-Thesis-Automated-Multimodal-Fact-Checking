## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/)), uses the image in an article about an attempt to down an Israeli helicopter in May 2019. Another source, PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03)), states that the image's context is missing and that it is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon.

Arab News PK ([https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east)) also uses the image in an article about Israeli strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza on March 25, 2019. The article mentions an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip.


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to The Times of Israel, an Israeli Air Force attack helicopter shot down a Hezbollah drone in the Binyamina area, south of Haifa, on November 2, 2024. ![image 6](media/5.jpg)
The Wikipedia article on the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon mentions the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which began on October 1, 2024, and ended with a ceasefire agreement on November 26, 2024. The article also mentions the 2024 Basta airstrikes on November 23, 2024, in Beirut. An article from Caliber.Az reports that the IDF conducted airstrikes targeting Hezbollah facilities in southern Lebanon on March 16, 2025.

## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image has been used in multiple contexts, including an article about an attempt to down an Israeli helicopter in May 2019 ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/)) and an article about Israeli strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza on March 25, 2019 ([https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east)).

The evidence also indicates that an Israeli Air Force attack helicopter shot down a Hezbollah drone on November 2, 2024, south of Haifa ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog\_entry/footage-shows-hezbollah-drone-from-lebanon-being-shot-down-by-iaf-helicopter-south-of-haifa/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/footage-shows-hezbollah-drone-from-lebanon-being-shot-down-by-iaf-helicopter-south-of-haifa/)). The image's context is missing, and it is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon ([https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03)).


## Final Judgement
The image has been used in different contexts, and the claim misrepresents the event. The image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah on November 23, 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image has been used in different contexts, including an article about an attempt to down an Israeli helicopter in May 2019 and an article about Israeli strikes on Hamas targets in Gaza on March 25, 2019. Furthermore, an Israeli Air Force attack helicopter shot down a Hezbollah drone on November 2, 2024, south of Haifa, but the image's context is missing, and it is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon.
