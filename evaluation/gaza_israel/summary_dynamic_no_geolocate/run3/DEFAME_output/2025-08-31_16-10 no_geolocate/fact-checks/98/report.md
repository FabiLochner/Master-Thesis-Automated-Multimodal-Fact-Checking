The evidence indicates that Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson expressed support for Israel amid the Hamas attacks. However, the image search results reveal that a fake image of Dwayne Johnson has been circulating. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Dwayne Johnson expressed support for Israel, but the image in the claim is not authentic. The image is a manipulated one.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed support for Israel, the image of him wearing the Israeli flag is not authentic, as indicated by the image search results, which show that the image has been manipulated.
