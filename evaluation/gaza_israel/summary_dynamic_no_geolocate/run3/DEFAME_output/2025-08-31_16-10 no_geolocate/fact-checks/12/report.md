## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's continued presence unlawful. The ICJ stated that Israel must end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations should not recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence. ([https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176))

The ICJ delivered an advisory opinion on December 19, 2024, on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion. The UN website provides links to the report in multiple languages. ([https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/)) The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg) ([https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/))


## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, stating that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but it did find Israel's continued presence unlawful and called for specific actions, including ending the unlawful presence and ceasing settlement activities.


## Final Judgement
The ICJ's advisory opinion in July 2024 found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, but it did not declare Israel an illegal state. The ICJ called for specific actions, including ending the unlawful presence and ceasing settlement activities.

The claim is not factually accurate because the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, even though it found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, as stated in the summary published on the ICJ website ([https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176)). However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.
