Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on April 12, 2025, stating that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan lambasted Israel for undermining stability in Syria. <image:13263>, <image:13264>. The article mentions talks between Turkey and Israel to defuse tensions and a meeting between Erdoğan and Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. The article also mentions the Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's statement about the need for a deconfliction mechanism with Israel.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025 is not supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of strong criticism of Israel by Turkish President Erdoğan in March 2025, including a call for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/](https://www.jns.org/turkeys-moves-in-syria-threaten-israel/)), there is no evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to intervene.

So, the overall veracity is: false
