Useful result: From [Source](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3654573/houthis-attack-commercial-shipping-vessel-with-anti-ship-missiles/): 
Content: CENTCOM reports that Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired anti-ship ballistic missiles at the U.S.-flagged container ship M/V Maersk Detroit in the Gulf of Aden. The USS Gravely (DDG 107) shot down two of the missiles. The press release was published on an official U.S. government website.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_the_MV_Maersk_Hangzhou): 
Content: The search result from Wikipedia mentions that on December 30, 2023, Houthi forces attacked the MV Maersk Hangzhou in the Gulf of Aden. The article also lists several attacks and military operations in the Red Sea and Yemen, including a July 2024 Israeli attack on Yemen.

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: Multiple sources, including Reuters and PBS News, confirm that U.S.-flagged container ships, such as the Maersk Sentosa and M/V Maersk Detroit, were targeted in the Gulf of Aden by Houthi rebels in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not verify the statement attributed to a Maersk spokesperson.

So, the overall veracity is: false
