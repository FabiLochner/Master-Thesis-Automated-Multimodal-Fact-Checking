### Evidence from `web_search`
The image in the claim shows a protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. However, the photos are not from Kolkata, India, as the claim states. According to Factly ([Source](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/)), the photos are from a protest held in Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 12, 2025, with approximately 100,000 participants (![image 5422](media/2025-08-23_01-41-1755913265-318914.jpg), ![image 5425](media/2025-08-23_01-41-1755913273-290121.jpg)).

Kashif ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/images-of-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-palestine-from-bangladesh-circulate-as-from-india/)) confirms that the images are from Dhaka, Bangladesh, and were falsely claimed to be from Kolkata, India (![image 5433](media/2025-08-23_01-41-1755913280-402649.jpg), ![image 5436](media/2025-08-23_01-41-1755913295-226450.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The images depict a protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people, but the event took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The protest occurred on April 12, 2025, at Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka, with approximately 100,000 participants.


## Final Judgement

### Verdict: FALSE
