The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. Evidence suggests an Iranian government official orchestrated a plot to assassinate Donald Trump, not Jewish Americans, as stated in the claim. While the provided sources discuss the economic impact of an Iran-Israel war, they do not support the assertion that Israel desires American funding or servicemen for the conflict.
