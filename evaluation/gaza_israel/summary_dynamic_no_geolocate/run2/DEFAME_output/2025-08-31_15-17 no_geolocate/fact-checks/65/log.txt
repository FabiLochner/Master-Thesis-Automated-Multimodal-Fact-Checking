Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-resumes-strikes-in-gaza-killing-more-than-400-palestinians-and-shattering-ceasefire-with-hamas): 
Content: The PBS article discusses the resumption of Israeli strikes in Gaza in March 2025, which resulted in over 400 Palestinian deaths. The article includes an image of the destruction in Gaza <image:13256>.

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While there was heavy Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, resulting in casualties, the image's origin and its specific connection to the event cannot be verified. The reverse image search yielded no results, and the image search did not find the image in question. Therefore, the claim is unproven.

So, the overall veracity is: false
