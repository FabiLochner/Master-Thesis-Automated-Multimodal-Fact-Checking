Sputnik India ([https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html](https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html)) reports that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh. ![image 13395](media/2025-08-31_16-05-1756656315-521817.jpg) Sputnik Globe published articles about Ismail Haniyeh, including one discussing his assassination in Tehran, but they do not mention tracking via WhatsApp.


## Elaboration
The Sputnik India article ([https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html](https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html)) reports that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh. This supports the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals unconfirmed reports and claims from Iranian state media and Sputnik that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The Sputnik India article specifically mentions that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is supported by reports, although they are unconfirmed. Therefore, the most appropriate decision is `true`.

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
The claim is supported by reports, although unconfirmed, that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The Sputnik India article ([https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html](https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html)) states that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh.
