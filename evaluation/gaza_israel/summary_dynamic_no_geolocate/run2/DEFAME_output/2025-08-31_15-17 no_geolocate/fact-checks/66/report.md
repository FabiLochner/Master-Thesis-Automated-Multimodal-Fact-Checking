### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to [Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://spotlight.ebu.ch/p/video-caption-falsely-claims-zelenskyy), the video and images were falsely claimed to be Israeli bombs for use in Gaza. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs. Zelenskyy wrote "Glory to Ukraine" and "Thanks for Support" on the shells, referencing Ukraineâ€™s war with Russia.

The visit stirred controversy. ![image 40](media/66.jpg) ![image 11669](media/2025-08-31_10-46-1756637218-195721.jpg)
