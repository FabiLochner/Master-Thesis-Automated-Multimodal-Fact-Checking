Content: The Anadolu Agency published an article on January 30, 2025, stating that the International Medical Corps (IMC) refuted claims made by the Trump administration that US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms or provide family planning services in Gaza. The article mentions that the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that $50 million in taxpayer dollars were going to fund condoms in Gaza, but did not provide evidence. The article also mentions that a review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom deliveries to Gaza. <image:k>

Content: The White House announced that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) halted a $50 million payment for "condoms in Gaza." The article mentions that the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, described the expense as a waste of taxpayer money. Elon Musk, the head of DOGE, commented that the expense was the "tip of the iceberg." The article was published on January 28th, 2025, by The National News Desk. <image:12980>

The claim '$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not entirely accurate. While the White House stated that DOGE halted a $50 million payment for condoms in Gaza, other sources, including CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and the Anadolu Agency ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324)), refute this, and there is no evidence to support it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
