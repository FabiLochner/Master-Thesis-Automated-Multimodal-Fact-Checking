## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Jewish Congress provides the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, which was adopted on May 26, 2016. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, such as making allegations about Jews as a collective, denying the Holocaust, and holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel. The IHRA definition has been adopted or endorsed by numerous countries and organizations.

The search results do not mention any amendment to the definition in March 2025 or the inclusion of "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, adopted in May 2016. One source, published on August 26, 2025, from [urj.org](https://urj.org/blog/five-definitions-antisemitism), mentions that the definition is a "working definition" which "connote[s] the possibility for change." The article also mentions the Nexus Document and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism, which were written in response to the IHRA definition.

Another article from [palquest.org](https://www.palquest.org/en/highlight/38757/ihra-working-definition-antisemitism) discusses the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism and its examples, noting that by March 2025, the definition had been endorsed by 44 UN member states. Neither source mentions the World Jewish Congress or any amendment to the definition in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted in May 2016. While the definition is considered a "working definition" and subject to change, the search results do not mention any amendment by the World Jewish Congress in March 2025. Specifically, there is no mention of including "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" in the definition.

The search results provide information about the IHRA definition and its adoption by various entities. However, they do not support the claim of an amendment in March 2025.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence does not support the claim that the World Jewish Congress amended the IHRA working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel." The search results focus on the original definition and its adoption, with no mention of the alleged amendment.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The World Jewish Congress's IHRA working definition of antisemitism, adopted in 2016, has not been amended to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" as of March 2025. The search results provide no evidence of such an amendment.
