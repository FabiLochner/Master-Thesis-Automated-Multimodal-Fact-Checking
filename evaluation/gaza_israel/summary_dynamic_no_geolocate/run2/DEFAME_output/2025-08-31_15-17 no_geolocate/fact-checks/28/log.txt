Useful result: From [Source](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/04/08/israeli-diplomat-booted-from-au-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/): 
Content: The Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from an annual conference on the Rwandan genocide held in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025. <image:8426> The article states that the African Union joined a case filed in the International Court of Justice by South Africa against Israel’s genocide in Gaza in February 2025.

The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: Multiple sources, including the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)), report that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia was expelled from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa in April 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador; rather, the expulsion was due to other member states' refusal to participate alongside him.

So, the overall veracity is: false
