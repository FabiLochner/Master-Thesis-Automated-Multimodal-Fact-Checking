## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics. In Tokyo, Fethi Nourine withdrew to avoid a potential fight against Butbul. ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg) <image:i> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics. However, the reason for his absence was failing to make weight, not a direct withdrawal. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances.

The provided evidence also mentions that this is not the first time an Algerian judoka has avoided a match against an Israeli opponent. In the Tokyo Olympics, Fethi Nourine withdrew to avoid a potential fight against Butbul.


## Final Judgement
The claim is accurate as an Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against an Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Olympics. While the reason was failing to make weight, the outcome aligns with the claim.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
An Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics because he failed to make weight, as reported by ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)), The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)), and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)).
