PBS News published an article on March 20, 2025, about an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children, including a month-old girl's parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023, and nearly 49,000 Palestinians have been killed since then.

The BBC published an article on December 29, 2023, about a baby girl pulled alive from the rubble in Rafah after an Israeli air strike that killed her mother and sister. More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza. The BBC also published several videos in July and August 2025 about the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
