Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877): 
Content: NBC News published an article about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The article includes an image of tents on fire <image:13331>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo): 
Content: The BBC article from April 18, 2025, shows an image of a fire in Gaza <image:13332>.

The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and incidents of tents on fire in Gaza in April 2025, the image's origin and context could not be verified. The reverse image search and other searches did not provide any evidence to support the claim that the image depicts tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
