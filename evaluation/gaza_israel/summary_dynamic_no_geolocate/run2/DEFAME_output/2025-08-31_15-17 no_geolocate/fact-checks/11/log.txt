The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base did occur on October 13, 2024, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-war-iran-palestine-lebanon-10-13-24), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_drone_strike_on_Binyamina), and [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-news-10-13-2024-a8cd5df3e2bb4ab08405a78251244bb2), the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated is contradicted by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443), which reported on false rumors of his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
