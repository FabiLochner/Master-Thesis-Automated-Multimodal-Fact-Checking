Content: The search result from boughtbyzionism.org, authored by Melissa Garriga, discusses Kamala Harris's stance on Israel, criticizing her support and highlighting her ties to pro-Israel groups. It mentions the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America's endorsement of Harris on July 22, 2024. The article does not contain the quote in the claim. <image:13167>

The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu around the specified date and expressed support for Israel, the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" is not found in the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
