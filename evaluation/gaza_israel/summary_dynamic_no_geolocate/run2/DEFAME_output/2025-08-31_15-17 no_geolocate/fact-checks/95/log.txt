Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_July_2024_al-Mawasi_attack): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes killed at least 90 Palestinians and injured over 300. <image:62> The article mentions that the attack targeted Hamas leaders and that the EU called for an independent investigation, describing the attack as a possible war crime. The article also mentions that an arrest warrant was issued for Mohammed Deif by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on 21 November 2024, but the warrant was cancelled in February 2025 after Hamas confirmed Deif's death.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/israeli-attacks-kill-dozens-of-palestinians-in-southern-and-central-gaza): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on July 16, 2024, reporting on Israeli attacks in Gaza that killed at least 42 Palestinians and wounded dozens. The attacks targeted a UN-run school in the Nuseirat refugee camp and a main street in al-Mawasi. <image:1>. The article mentions that the bombing of al-Razi is the sixth Israeli attack on UN schools in the past 10 days.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/bodies-trapped-gaza-city-under-israeli-assault-mediators-push-truce-2024-07-11/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on July 11, 2024, discusses the ongoing conflict in Gaza, including Israeli airstrikes and the failure of peace talks. <image:13439> The article mentions that the war has been going on for 10 months and has resulted in the deaths of over 38,000 Palestinians.

The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of a man in Turkey after the February 2023 earthquake, not in Gaza after an Israeli bombing, as evidenced by reverse image searches and articles from sources like The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
