Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/tags/adam-milstein): Found exact image on website with title: Adam Milstein | The Jerusalem Post
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article on July 27, 2023, by Adam Milstein, which includes an image of a swastika on the base of the Statue de la RÃ©publique in Paris during a pro-Palestinian protest in 2014. <image:546154>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, as reported by *Vanity Fair* ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market)), not a 2024 protest against Le Pen's victory.

So, the overall veracity is: false
