The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024. The UN website provides links to the report in multiple languages.

The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg) ([https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/world-leaders-must-act-to-end-israels-unlawful-presence-in-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/))


## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024 regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and stated that Israel must end its unlawful presence. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful.


## Final Judgement
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful.

The claim is partially accurate as the ICJ did issue a ruling in July 2024 regarding Israel's actions. However, the claim misrepresents the ruling, which found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, but did not declare Israel an illegal state. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's continued presence unlawful, as stated in the ICJ's summary ([https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176)). However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.
