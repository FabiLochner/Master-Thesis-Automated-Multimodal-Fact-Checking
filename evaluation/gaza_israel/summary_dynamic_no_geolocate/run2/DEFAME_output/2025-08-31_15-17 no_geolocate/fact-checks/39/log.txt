Content: The search result from Factly.in states that the image in the claim is from a 2023 issue of Vogue China magazine and does not show Chinaâ€™s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games. The article mentions that China's uniform for the Paris Olympics features red and white colors. <image:6130>, <image:6131>, <image:6133>, <image:6147>, <image:6148>.

The claim '<image:27> This image shows an athlete of China which has chosen a design of the Palestinian flag for the Paris 2024 Olympics.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image in the claim is from the September 2023 issue of Vogue China Magazine and was taken for the promotion of the Hangzhou Asian Games, not the Paris 2024 Olympics, as reported by [Factly](https://factly.in/an-old-photo-from-vogue-china-magazine-is-being-falsely-shared-as-showing-chinese-athletes-wearing-the-colours-of-the-palestinian-flag/) and [Fact Crescendo](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/china-has-not-chosen-a-design-inspired-by-the-palestinian-flag-for-the-paris-olympics-2024/).
