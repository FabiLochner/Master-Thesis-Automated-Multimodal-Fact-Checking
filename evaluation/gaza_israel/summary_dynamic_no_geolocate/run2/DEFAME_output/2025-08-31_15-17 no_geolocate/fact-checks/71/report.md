## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.haberler.com/in-syria-an-abandoned-tank-has-become-a-fruit-and-2027395/): Found exact image on website with title: In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
Content: The search result is from a Turkish news website and shows an image of a tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand. The article states that the tank was abandoned by regime forces in Syria. The article is dated December 15, 2024. ![image 2101](media/2025-07-20_10-59-1753009194-040967.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 43](media/71.jpg)) shows a vegetable stand with a tank. According to a fact-check published on aol.com, the tank is a Syrian T-55, not an Israeli Merkava tank, and the image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The Merkava tank is a main battle tank used by the Israel Defense Forces since 1979, and has been used in several conflicts, including the Gaza War. Forbes published an article discussing a guide distributed by Hamas on how to destroy Israeli Merkava tanks.
