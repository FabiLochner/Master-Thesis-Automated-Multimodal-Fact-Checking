Useful result: From [Source](https://crispr-gene-editing-regs-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org/israel-germline-embryonic/): 
Content: The search result from crispr-gene-editing-regs-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org states that germline gene editing is prohibited in Israel, but the Minister of Health may give permission for germline gene editing experiments, upon the recommendation of an advisory committee. The "Prohibition of Genetic Intervention" Law, passed in 1999 and amended in 2016, bans germline gene editing unless authorized. <image:13172> <image:13173>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports on the use of DNA tests by the Chief Rabbinate in Israel to determine Jewishness, which has become a point of contention. The article mentions a 2000 law that grants authority for genetic testing to both civil family courts and religious authorities with consent. Yisrael Beytenu has vowed to try and pass legislation outlawing it. <image:13184>

Useful result: From [Source](https://welcome-israel.com/blog/repatriation-to-israel-through-a-dna-test): 
Content: The article from welcome-israel.com, updated August 14, 2025, discusses DNA testing in Israel for repatriation. It states that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but it is not generally accepted as the sole method for proving Jewish ancestry or for repatriation under the Law of Return. <image:k>

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Evidence indicates that DNA testing is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewishness, and is authorized by law, although there are regulations and discussions about the use of genetic information, and specific laws regarding germline gene editing. Sources include [crispr-gene-editing-regs-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org](https://crispr-gene-editing-regs-tracker.geneticliteracyproject.org) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
