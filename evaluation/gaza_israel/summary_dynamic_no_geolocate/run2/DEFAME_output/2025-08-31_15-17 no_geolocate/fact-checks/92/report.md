## Elaboration
The image depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023. The claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024 is false.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false as the image is of a Syrian child rescued after an earthquake in 2023, not a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in 2024. The image is being misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake in February 2023, as reported by [Enab Baladi](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/), [UAE Times](https://uaetimes.ae/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/), and [El País](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-07-20/the-manual-of-repression-shared-by-modern-tyrants.html). The claim misrepresents the image's context, falsely associating it with a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.
