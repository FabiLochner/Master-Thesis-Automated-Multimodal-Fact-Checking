Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 6, 2024, discussing Keir Starmer's call for a ceasefire in Gaza and his urging for unity in Britain. The article mentions Starmer's comments on the anniversary of the October 7 attacks and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. <image:1011>, <image:1012>, <image:1010>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on June 4, 2024, discussing the pressure on Keir Starmer to take stronger action against Israel regarding the situation in Gaza. <image:1023> shows protesters calling for the UK to sanction Israel. Starmer described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire. He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.

The claim 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Keir Starmer has expressed concerns about the Israel-Gaza conflict, called for a ceasefire, and considered sanctions, there is no evidence from sources like [MAP](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza) or the BBC to suggest he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
