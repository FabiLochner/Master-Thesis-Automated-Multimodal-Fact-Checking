## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/). The attack was part of the ongoing Israeli–Lebanese conflict and was claimed by Hezbollah. The drone hit a bedroom window but did not penetrate further due to reinforced glass <image:i>.

The attack was also reported by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216). Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack, and there were no injuries. The Times of Israel article includes a tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu describing the attack as an assassination attempt on "me and my wife." ![image 5540](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913514-658764.jpg), ![image 5541](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913515-076396.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel)) reported a drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, Israel. ![image 11706](media/2025-08-31_10-53-1756637594-897146.jpg) ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

Both articles state that Netanyahu was not present and there were no casualties. The Al Jazeera article also mentions Hezbollah firing rockets at northern Israel.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by multiple sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel)). However, the evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

The evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

The claim is missing information about Yair Netanyahu's presence or involvement in the attack.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms a drone attack on October 19, 2024, on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack. The evidence explicitly states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While multiple sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/drone-launched-netanyahu-home-northern-israel-spokesman-says-2024-10-19/), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel)) confirm a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on that date, the reports state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.
