### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. State Department is offering assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel, including charter flights to Europe, with options to Athens or Frankfurt by air, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. Americans will be asked to repay the U.S. government for these flights. The State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory.

Newsweek mentions "Operation Exodus" and notes that the embassy in Jerusalem is assisting with departures via cruise ship, commercial or charter flights, or U.S. government-operated flights. These actions are in response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict, which aligns with the claim. The U.S. is also assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights, with the expectation that the flights will be repaid.

The evidence supports the claim that the U.S. government is providing assistance for departures from both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the U.S. is assisting *U.S. citizens* in leaving Israel, and that these flights are to be repaid.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported, but the assertion about flying Israeli citizens is not. More information is needed to verify the claim about flying Israeli citizens.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/): 
Content: The Missouri Independent published an article on October 13, 2023, stating that the U.S. State Department will arrange charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel starting Friday, October 13, 2023, due to the conflict. ![image 13195](media/2025-08-31_15-43-1756654998-591515.jpg) The State Department is working to meet the demand for flights as commercial flights are being reduced. The article also mentions that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pledged continued support.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. government arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel starting in October 2023, due to the conflict. The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence. The evidence specifies that the flights were for U.S. citizens.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is offering loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon and has been assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights since October 2023. The claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is providing emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon amid escalating conflict in October 2024, as stated in the claim. Additionally, the U.S. has been assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights since October 2023, as reported by [Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/). However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.
