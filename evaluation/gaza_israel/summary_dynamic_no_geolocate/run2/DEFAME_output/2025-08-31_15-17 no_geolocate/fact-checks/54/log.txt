Useful result: From [Source](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/): 
Content: The Missouri Independent published an article on October 13, 2023, stating that the U.S. State Department will arrange charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel starting Friday, October 13, 2023, due to the conflict. <image:13195> The State Department is working to meet the demand for flights as commercial flights are being reduced. The article also mentions that Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pledged continued support.

The claim 'As the tensions between Israel and Hezbollah escalate in October, 2024, the U.S. government is offering Americans loans to pay for flights out of Lebanon while they have been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year 'on US taxpayers' dime.' is false.
Justification: The U.S. government is providing emergency loans and arranging flights for U.S. citizens to depart Lebanon amid escalating conflict in October 2024, as stated in the claim. Additionally, the U.S. has been assisting U.S. citizens in leaving Israel via charter flights since October 2023, as reported by [Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/). However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
