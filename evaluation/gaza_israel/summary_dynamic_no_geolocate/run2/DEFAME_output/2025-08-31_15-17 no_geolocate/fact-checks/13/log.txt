Useful result: From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an "Iran Update" on September 13, 2024, discussing the ongoing conflict between Israel and various groups. The report mentions an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, which the US Embassy in Baghdad assessed was likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. The report also mentions that Iranian-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah, have conducted attacks into northern Israel. <image:5911> The IDF killed three senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on September 11. The report also mentions that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired rockets targeting Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor on September 13. <image:5913>

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not related to the alleged attack on a US facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Reverse image searches show the image is from an explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, or a fireworks warehouse in Northern California. The web search confirms an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, but the image is not related to this event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
