### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an "Iran Update" on September 13, 2024, discussing the ongoing conflict between Israel and various groups. The report mentions an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, which the US Embassy in Baghdad assessed was likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. The report also mentions that Iranian-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah, have conducted attacks into northern Israel. ![image 5911](media/2025-08-29_19-32-1756495975-895292.jpg) The IDF killed three senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on September 11. The report also mentions that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired rockets targeting Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor on September 13. ![image 5913](media/2025-08-29_19-33-1756495983-781166.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image (![image 11](media/13.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image is from an explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, which occurred around 10:30 p.m. on an unspecified Tuesday night, or from a fireworks warehouse in Northern California. The web search reveals that there was an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, but the provided image is not related to this event.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not related to the event described in the claim. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not related to the alleged attack on a US facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Reverse image searches show the image is from an explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha, New Jersey, or a fireworks warehouse in Northern California. The web search confirms an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, but the image is not related to this event.
