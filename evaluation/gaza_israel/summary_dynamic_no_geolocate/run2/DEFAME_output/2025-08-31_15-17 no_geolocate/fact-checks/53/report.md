## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East. The post, made without mentioning Israel or Hamas by name, stated that if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025, "there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East." ![image 11568](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-192813.jpg), ![image 11567](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636512-862768.jpg), ![image 11569](media/2025-08-31_10-35-1756636513-524886.jpg). The article also mentions a meeting between President Joe Biden and families of American hostages.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, the provided quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel" is not found in the search results. Instead, a post threatening consequences for those holding hostages in the Middle East is mentioned.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the specific quote in the claim is not found in the search results. Instead, a post threatening consequences for those holding hostages in the Middle East is mentioned.

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided quote is not supported by the evidence. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as confirmed by sources like the [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), the specific quote in the claim is not found in the search results. Instead, a post threatening consequences for those holding hostages in the Middle East is mentioned by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/).
