Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East. The post, made without mentioning Israel or Hamas by name, stated that if the hostages are not released before January 20, 2025, "there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East." <image:11568>, <image:11567>, <image:11569>. The article also mentions a meeting between President Joe Biden and families of American hostages.

The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as confirmed by sources like the [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), the specific quote in the claim is not found in the search results. Instead, a post threatening consequences for those holding hostages in the Middle East is mentioned by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
