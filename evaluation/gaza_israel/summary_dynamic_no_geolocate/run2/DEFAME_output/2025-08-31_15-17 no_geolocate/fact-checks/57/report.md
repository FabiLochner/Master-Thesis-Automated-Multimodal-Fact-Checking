## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during April 2025. One source, a Wikipedia article, details an airstrike on April 9, 2025, in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, resulting in numerous casualties and displacement of residents. Another source from PBS News reports on airstrikes on April 3, 2025, in Gaza, including attacks on a school in the Tuffah neighborhood and homes in Shijaiyah, with a high death toll. The Guardian also reported on an airstrike on April 3, 2025, on a school in the al-Tuffah neighborhood and mentions an airstrike on the Shujaâ€™iya suburb of Gaza City.

## Elaboration
