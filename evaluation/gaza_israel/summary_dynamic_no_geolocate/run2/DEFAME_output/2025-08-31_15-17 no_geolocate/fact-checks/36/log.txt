The claim 'Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including NPR and The Times of Israel, indicates that Yoav Gallant was the Defense Minister and was later replaced, and he was alive and active after the alleged date of his death. Additionally, Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the war cabinet on June 17, 2024, which included Gallant.

So, the overall veracity is: false
