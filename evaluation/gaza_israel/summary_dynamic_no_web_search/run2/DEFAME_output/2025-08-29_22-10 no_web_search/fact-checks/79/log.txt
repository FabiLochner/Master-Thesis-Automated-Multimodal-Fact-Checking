Useful result: From [Source](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/): 
Content: Politico.eu published an article about a Hezbollah rocket attack. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the attack. <image:8201>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/21/hezbollah-launches-medium-range-rockets-israel): 
Content: Axios reports that Hezbollah launched medium-range rockets into Israel in September 2024. <image:8202>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats published a map showing attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024. The map indicates that Lebanese Hezbollah conducted a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. <image:8203>

The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was a Hezbollah rocket attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, the image provided in the claim does not depict the aftermath of that attack. The evidence includes reports of the attack and images of the damage, which do not match the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
