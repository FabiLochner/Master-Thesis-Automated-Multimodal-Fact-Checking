The claim '<image:31> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsupported. While there were explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, and iPhones have exploded in the past, there is no evidence to connect the image to the pager attacks or to an iPhone explosion during that time, as confirmed by sources like [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hezbollah-devices-explode-lebanon-pager-blasts-beirut-israel-2602266-2024-09-18).

So, the overall veracity is: false
