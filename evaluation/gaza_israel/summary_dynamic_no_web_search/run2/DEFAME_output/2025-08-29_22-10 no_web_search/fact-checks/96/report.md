### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza killed at least 16 people on July 6, 2024. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)) ![image 8244](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506449-449749.jpg)

Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school. ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/07/israeli-airstrike-in-central-gaza-wipes-out-shelter-in-unrwa-school_6674107_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/07/israeli-airstrike-in-central-gaza-wipes-out-shelter-in-unrwa-school_6674107_4.html)) ![image 8245](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506449-887392.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza occurred on July 6, 2024, resulting in casualties. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or the Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The image search did yield an image of two children, but it is not confirmed to be the same children mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, while the date and location of the attack are confirmed, the specific details about the children and the school in the claim remain unverified. Further investigation is needed to confirm the identities of the children and the specific location mentioned in the claim.

## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while an Israeli attack on a UN school in Gaza on July 6, 2024, is confirmed, the specific details about Mayar Hamida, Bilal Hamida, and the Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp remain unverified. The image search did not yield any results.

The claim cannot be verified due to the lack of evidence confirming the specific details about the children and the school. `false`
