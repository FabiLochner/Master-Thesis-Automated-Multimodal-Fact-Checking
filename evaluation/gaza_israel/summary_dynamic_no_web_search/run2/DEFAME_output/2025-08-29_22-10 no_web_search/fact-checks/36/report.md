## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on October 8, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant postponed a visit to Washington (![image 7972](media/2025-08-29_22-16-1756505775-122531.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article about Benjamin Netanyahu firing Yoav Gallant, including an image of Netanyahu and Gallant (![image 7973](media/2025-08-29_22-16-1756505775-533297.jpg)).

An NPR article, published on November 5, 2024, features an image of Yoav Gallant (![image 7974](media/2025-08-29_22-16-1756505775-821891.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that he postponed a visit, and an NPR article from November 5, 2024, also features an image of him. The claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024, is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024, as he was mentioned in news articles published on October 8 and November 5, 2024. This contradicts the claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from Reuters and NPR, published after October 1, 2024, shows that Yoav Gallant was alive after the alleged date of his death.
