The claim 'Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence, including articles from The Times of Israel, The Guardian, and Livemint.com, contains information and images related to Esmail Qaani, but none of the sources confirm that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
