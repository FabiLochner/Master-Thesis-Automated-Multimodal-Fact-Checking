The claim '<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding the Israeli flag. While the evidence confirms the meeting occurred, the exact date is not specified. Therefore, the claim that the meeting happened in September 2024 or during the ongoing Gaza war cannot be verified due to the lack of a specific date in the provided evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
