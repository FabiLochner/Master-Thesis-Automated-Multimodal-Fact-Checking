Content: The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published a report on October 16, 2024, discussing emerging trends in chemical weapons usage in the Middle East. The report, authored by Natasha Hall, analyzes the growing willingness of states to develop and deploy chemical weapons. The report includes an image of a girl holding an oxygen mask over the face of an infant following a reported gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, on January 22, 2018. <image:5763> The report also includes an image of three men wearing gas masks. <image:5761> The report's findings suggest that the taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013.

Useful result: From [Source](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/): 
Content: The search result from belux.edmo.eu contains the image <image:8260>. The article discusses the misrepresentation of the image online.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim has been misrepresented, as indicated by the fact-check. The website [belux.edmo.eu](https://belux.edmo.eu/photo-of-syrian-girl-holding-babys-oxygen-mask-misrepresented-online/) discusses the misrepresentation of the image. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
