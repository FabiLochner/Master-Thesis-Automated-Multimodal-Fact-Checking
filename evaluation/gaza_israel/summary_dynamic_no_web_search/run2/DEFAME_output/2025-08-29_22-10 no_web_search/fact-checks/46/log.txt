Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/31/live-aid-campaigner-bob-geldof-was-scathing-about-african-leaders-files-reveal): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on December 31, 2024, about Bob Geldof. <image:8024>

The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there are images and articles related to U2 and Bob Geldof, none of the provided evidence, including an AI-generated image and news articles from sources like The Journal, Reuters, BBC, and The Guardian, supports the assertion of a multi-stadium tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.

So, the overall veracity is: false
