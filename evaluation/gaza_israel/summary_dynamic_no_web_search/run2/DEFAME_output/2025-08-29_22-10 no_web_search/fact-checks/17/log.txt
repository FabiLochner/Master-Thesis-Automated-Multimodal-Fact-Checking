The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. Multiple sources, including [Ahram Online](https://english.ahram.org.eg/News/527018.aspx) and [Seatrade Maritime](https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/containers/houthi-target-us-flagged-maersk-ship-in-failed-missile-strike), confirm that a US-flagged Maersk vessel was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. However, the evidence does not include a statement from a Maersk spokesperson, making that part of the claim unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
