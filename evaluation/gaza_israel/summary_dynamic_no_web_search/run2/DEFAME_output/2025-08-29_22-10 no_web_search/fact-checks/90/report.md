## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Algerian judoka, Dris M.R., was investigated for not making weight for a match against Israeli judoka Butbul. This suggests a withdrawal, as failing to make weight would prevent the match from taking place. The Guardian's report supports the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results from BBC Sport and The Guardian confirm that an Algerian judoka, Dris M.R., was investigated for failing to make weight for a match against an Israeli opponent, Butbul. This implies a withdrawal from the match.
