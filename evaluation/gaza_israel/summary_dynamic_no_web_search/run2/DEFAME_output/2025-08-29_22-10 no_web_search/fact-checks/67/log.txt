The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check, based on multiple image searches and articles from sources like The Times of Israel, The New Arab, AP News, and The New York Times, found no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control Israel regarding its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025. The search results primarily focused on Turkey's relations with Syria and Israel, but did not mention any such request to the U.S. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
