## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/world/middleeast/syria-turkey-al-shara-erdogan.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article that contains an image of Turkey's President. ![image 8161](media/2025-08-29_22-22-1756506163-989995.jpg)


## Elaboration
The latest search result from The New York Times includes an image of Turkey's President. However, the article does not provide any information about the U.S. being urged by Turkey in March 2025 to control Israel regarding its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of supporting evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results provide images of Turkey's President and articles discussing Turkey's relations with Syria and Israel. However, none of the sources mention the U.S. being urged by Turkey in March 2025 to control Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check, based on multiple image searches and articles from sources like The Times of Israel, The New Arab, AP News, and The New York Times, found no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control Israel regarding its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025. The search results primarily focused on Turkey's relations with Syria and Israel, but did not mention any such request to the U.S. Therefore, the claim is unverified.
