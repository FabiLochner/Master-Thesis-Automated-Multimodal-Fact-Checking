Useful result: From [Source](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market): Found exact image on website with title: The Troubling Question in the French Jewish Community - Vanity Fair
Content: The Vanity Fair article, published in July 2015, discusses rising antisemitism in France, focusing on events in 2014 and early 2015. It mentions a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, where a swastika was painted on a statue and chants of "Death to the Jews" were heard. <image:20> The article also describes a rise in anti-Semitic incidents, including attacks on synagogues and Jewish schools. The article references the Hyper Cacher attack in January 2015 and the concerns of the Jewish community.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017): Found exact image on website with title: German TV agrees to air anti-Semitism documentary following cries ...
Content: The World Jewish Congress published an article on June 19, 2017, about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism. The article includes an image <image:6999> that is similar to the image in the claim. The article also mentions the BDS movement and anti-Zionism.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/tags/adam-milstein): Found exact image on website with title: Adam Milstein | The Jerusalem Post
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article by Adam Milstein on July 27, 2023, discussing antisemitism in Europe. The article includes an image of a swastika on the base of the Statue de la RÃ©publique in Paris during a protest in support of Palestinians on July 26, 2014. <image:k>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris on July 26, 2014, as evidenced by a Vanity Fair article from July 2015 and a Jerusalem Post article from July 2023, not a protest against Le Pen's victory in the 2024 French parliamentary elections.

So, the overall veracity is: false
