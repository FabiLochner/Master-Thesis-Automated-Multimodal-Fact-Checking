The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While there is evidence of an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and significant US financial and military support for Israel ([Source](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/israel-iran-conflict-how-has-united-states-financed-israel-over-the-years-dollars-all-the-way-2743451-2025-06-20)), the claim incorrectly attributes the plot to Jewish Americans and does not fully support the assertion about Israel's intentions regarding US involvement in a war with Iran.

So, the overall veracity is: false
