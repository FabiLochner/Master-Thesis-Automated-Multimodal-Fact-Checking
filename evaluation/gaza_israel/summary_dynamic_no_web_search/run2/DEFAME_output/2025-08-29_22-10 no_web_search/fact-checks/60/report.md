## Actions

reverse_search(![image 35](media/60.jpg))

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 35](media/60.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image's metadata indicates it was taken by Mahmud Hams. The reverse image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. Without further information, it is impossible to verify the claim.

I need more information to verify the claim, such as the location of the image and the context of the event.
