Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here).

Shu Hu, head of Purdue University's Machine Learning and Media Forensics Lab in the United States, told AFP the image was AI-generated (archived link). Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was ""no obvious segmentation"", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery. While there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media, identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI."

However, the claim that these individuals have ceased fighting in Gaza and Lebanon to become ""settlers"" is not directly supported by the evidence. While some evidence suggests a connection between Israelis and Thailand, including war-weary reservists and emotional recovery tourism for IDF soldiers, there is no direct evidence to confirm the claim's specific assertions about the individuals in the image.

","However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic.

There is no evidence to support the assertion that they ceased operations after Trump's election.
","The militant group has said it will not halt its military operations, which come in response to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Huthi rebels have maintained their attacks in international waters since Trump won the 2024 US presidential election -- and the group's leader has confirmed the outcome will not change its military strategy."

While image searches revealed attacks on US facilities in Baghdad and a burning car, none of the images matched the one in the claim. Furthermore, a reverse image search yielded no results, and geolocation analysis did not identify Iraq as a likely location.

Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of launching the strike that killed Haniyeh. The photo was published online two years before the killing of Haniyeh, however.

Multiple sources confirm that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was arrested by ICE in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that he was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. The fact that an immigration judge ruled that he can be deported suggests that his permanent resident status is in question.
","Snopes readers contacted us asking if the story was true — if ICE agents had arrested and detained Khalil. They had. On March 10, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social announcing that ICE had arrested and detained Khalil, whom he called a ""Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student."" Trump's post said Khalil's arrest was the ""first of many to come"" and that he expected ""every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply"" with ICE's actions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an X post the day after Khalid was arrested that the department would revoke visas and green cards for ""Hamas supporters,"" and a separate X post from the official Department of Homeland Security account claimed that ""Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization."" On March 9, Khalil's lawyers filed a petition alleging that his detainment was illegal on the grounds that lawful permanent residents are protected by the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fifth Amendment right to due process."

","Trump did indeed say the above words, speaking at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Jan. 7, 2025. As such, we rate this claim a correct attribution. Trump made the comment in response to a journalist asking about the state of negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He was joined by Steve Witkoff, his pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, who said negotiators were ""making a lot of progress"" and ""hopefully it will all work out and we'll save some lives."" Witkoff also credited Trump's ""stature"" as driving the negotiation. A journalist then asked Trump and Witkoff to clarify past remarks about how ""all hell must be paid"" if Hamas did not release the hostages, to which Trump said, while briefly addressing Witkoff: 'I don't want to hurt your negotiations, [but] if [the hostages] are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East. And it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out. I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is.'"

We reached out to the author of the X post above to ask if they digitally created the image — or, if not, if they could share where they found it. We will update this report if we receive a response.

Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough comparison of the circulating image with the one shared by Israeli media and confirmed several similarities, including protesters wearing yellow, holding photos of Israeli hostages, the Israeli flag, objects on the building roof, and the presence of 27 coffins, arranged in three rows of nine. Sky News also shared a video showing Israeli protesters carrying coffins, reporting that the coffins represent hostages killed in Gaza.

Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading.
