## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on April 4, 2025, about Israeli troops expanding a security zone in northern Gaza, including an image of the aftermath of an airstrike in Gaza (![image 8102](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506003-433835.jpg)). The Guardian published an article about an Israeli bombing of a shelter in Gaza City in April 2025 (![image 8104](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506003-721711.jpg)).

The BBC News website contains an image of the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza City after an airstrike (![image 8106](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506003-811751.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that airstrikes occurred in Gaza City, including the Shejaeya neighborhood, in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention a baby named Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

## Final Judgement
The image search results confirm that airstrikes occurred in Gaza City, including the Shejaeya neighborhood, in April 2025. However, the search did not yield any information about a baby named Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While evidence confirms airstrikes in Gaza City, including the Shejaeya neighborhood, in April 2025, no information was found regarding a baby named Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike.
