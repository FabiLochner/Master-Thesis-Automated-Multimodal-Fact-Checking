Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966): 
Content: ABC News published an article about the Iranian attack on Israel and the Iron Dome air defense system. <image:14289>

The claim 'The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/2/iran-and-israel-what-are-their-attack-and-defence-capabilities) reports that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90% effective, this is a general statement and not specific to the October 1, 2024, attack. Other sources, such as [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966), discuss the attack but do not provide an interception rate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
