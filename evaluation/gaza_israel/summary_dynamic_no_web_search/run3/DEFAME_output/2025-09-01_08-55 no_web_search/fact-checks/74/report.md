## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) provides an image of people standing behind a barrier ![image 14290](media/2025-09-01_09-21-1756718498-631798.jpg). CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk)) contains an image of a person in uniform looking out of a broken window ![image 14291](media/2025-09-01_09-21-1756718499-046633.jpg). Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/victory-photo-will-beirut-killings-help-embattled-netanyahu-politically)) has no content.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not contain any information about Yair Netanyahu being killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024. The search results include images from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/)) and CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk)), but they do not mention the claim.

The Al Jazeera source ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/victory-photo-will-beirut-killings-help-embattled-netanyahu-politically)) also does not contain any relevant information.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

However, there is no information in the provided sources to support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while a drone attack did occur on October 19, 2024, targeting Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, there is no evidence to support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check confirms a drone attack on Netanyahu's home in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, as reported by Al Jazeera, but finds no evidence to support the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.
