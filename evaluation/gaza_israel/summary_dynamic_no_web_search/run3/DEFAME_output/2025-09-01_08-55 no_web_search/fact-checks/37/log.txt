The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, resulting in casualties, there is no evidence to connect the image provided to the attack. The image appears to be of a young child, and there is no information to confirm that the child in the image was a victim of the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
