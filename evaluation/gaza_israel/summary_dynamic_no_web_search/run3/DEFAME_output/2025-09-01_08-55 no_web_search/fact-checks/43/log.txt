Content: The search result includes an image with the quote attributed to Anthony Bourdain: "Today nearly everything is made in China - except for courage, it's made in Palestine." <image:14190>

The claim 'Anthony Bourdain once said, 'Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the quote is widely circulated and attributed to Anthony Bourdain on social media, searches for the quote's authenticity and origin did not yield any definitive results, making it impossible to confirm whether he actually said it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
