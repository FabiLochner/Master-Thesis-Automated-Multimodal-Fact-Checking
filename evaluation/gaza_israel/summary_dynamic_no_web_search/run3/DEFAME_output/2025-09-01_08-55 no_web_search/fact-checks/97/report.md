## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the US has not reinstituted the draft for the Israel-Hamas war. One source includes an image asking "IS THE DRAFT COMING BACK?", which implies that the draft is a topic of discussion. However, another source fact-checks the claim and states that there is no US military draft.

The evidence does not provide any information about the US reinstituting the draft.


## Final Judgement
The search results include a fact-check that denies the claim. Therefore, the claim is false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there may be discussions about the draft, a fact-check from WGRZ.com states that the US has not reinstituted the draft for the Israel-Hamas war.
