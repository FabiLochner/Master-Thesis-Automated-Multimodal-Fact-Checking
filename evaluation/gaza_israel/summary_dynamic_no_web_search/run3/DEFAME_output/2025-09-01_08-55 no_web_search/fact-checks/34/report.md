## Elaboration
The image in the claim (![image 23](media/34.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran in 2021, not from an event on October 26, 2024. While there were reports of Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, the image is not related to those events.

The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from a 2021 fire at an oil refinery near Tehran, as confirmed by reverse image searches and articles from sources like The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)). While there were reports of Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, the image is unrelated to those events.
