The claim 'The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the World Jewish Congress amended the IHRA definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" is not supported by the evidence. While the existence of the IHRA definition and the WJC's association with it are confirmed, no evidence of the specific amendment was found.

So, the overall veracity is: false
