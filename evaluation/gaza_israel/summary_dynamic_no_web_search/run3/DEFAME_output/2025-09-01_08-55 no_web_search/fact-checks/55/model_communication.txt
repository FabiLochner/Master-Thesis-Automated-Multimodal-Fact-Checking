The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?

 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")

 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_7420.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7420.mp4)

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

![cs_opinion_img](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:33>)
geolocate(<image:33>)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14230>). NPR also contains an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14231>). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:14232>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation data. The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from Gaza or that it was taken in December 2024.

To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the exact location and date the image was taken.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Claim
Text: "Chinese officials in white protective hazmat suits carried people down a hallway to be quarantined for having COVID-19 in November 2022."

ACTIONS:
```
image_search("China officials white suits carry people")
image_search("China officials carry people COVID quarantine 2022")
```

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:33>)
geolocate(<image:33>)
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14230>). NPR also contains an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14231>). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:14232>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation data. The image search results confirm that there has been destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from Gaza or that it was taken in December 2024.

To verify the claim, I would need to confirm the exact location and date the image was taken.


## Actions
```
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza December 2024")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Vatican News published an article about airstrikes in Gaza in December 2024, which includes an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14233>). Al Jazeera published an article on December 31, 2024, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:14234>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was destruction in Gaza in December 2024. However, the images found in the search results do not match the image in the claim.

Therefore, I cannot confirm the claim's veracity. I would need to find the exact source of the image to verify its location and date.

Gaza explosions rattle central Israel; scientist explains why
=============================================================

Locals reported hearing loud blasts Friday night, likely stemming from IDF strikes in Gaza, over 40 miles away; why do sounds of blasts from Gaza reach central Israel, how does weather play a role and why are they louder at night? Here’s the explanation

Residents of central Israel, including the Gush Dan and Shephelah regions, reported hearing loud explosions Friday night and early Saturday. The IDF confirmed no rocket impacts in the area while police attributed the sounds to explosions originating in Gaza, more than 40 miles away.

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the Davidson Institute of Science Education, explained to Ynet that atmospheric conditions can affect how sound travels, amplifying or diminishing its intensity. “When the air near the ground is warmer due to the sun heating the surface, sound waves are refracted upward into the sky. This can reduce the noise we hear,” he explained.

However, during nighttime, when the ground cools faster than the air above it, sound waves bend back toward the ground. “This phenomenon is why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night than during the day,” Dr. Rosenberg added.

The unique interaction of weather and sound physics highlights why certain noises travel farther or seem more pronounced depending on the time of day and environmental conditions.

In addition to explosions heard from Gaza, powerful booms have echoed through the Gush Dan region during the war, caused by rockets detonating over the sea. These loud blasts have sparked anxiety among residents due to their intensity.

“There are many factors that can influence the volume of an explosion we hear, meaning identical rockets detonating can sound vastly different,” explained Dr. Yuval Rosenberg. “The sound waves we perceive are essentially small disturbances in air pressure, which our brain interprets as sound after they reach our ears and vibrate the eardrum and the rest of our auditory system.”

“When a rocket explodes, it creates a shockwave characterized by a sudden and significant change in air pressure,” explained Dr. Rosenberg. “At close range, this shockwave can be extremely dangerous, capable of destroying buildings or killing marine life if the detonation occurs at sea.

"As it travels, the shockwave loses energy as it interacts with and is absorbed by objects, creating destruction but also heating the air. Eventually, as it continues over long distances, the shockwave dissipates and transforms into the sound waves we hear. Simply put, a shockwave is like a massive ocean swell that breaks into smaller waves.”

Dr. Rosenberg highlighted the difference in how explosion sounds carry over land versus sea. “For us to clearly hear the explosion, a significant amount of sound waves must reach our ears, or more precisely, the sound wave intensity must remain strong. However, various factors can block sound waves from reaching us. For instance, shockwaves and sound waves can be absorbed by the ground, trees and buildings. Hard surfaces like hills or building walls can also reflect sound waves, preventing them from reaching us,” he said.

“This is why when a rocket explodes on land, there are many obstacles that diminish the volume of the noise we hear. In contrast, over the sea, there are few such barriers, allowing sound waves to travel more freely and reach us more effectively,” he added.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's metadata indicates it was taken by Mahmud Hams. The reverse image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. Without further information, it is impossible to verify the claim.

I need more information to verify the claim, such as the location of the image and the context of the event.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search revealed an article from Al Jazeera on October 21, 2024, discussing the US seeking an end to the war in Lebanon. The geolocate function suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

The claim states the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon. The evidence suggests the image might be from Palestine, not Lebanon. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Source of the claim

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל: לפני זמן קצר נורה טיל לעבר בית פרטי ביישוב אביבים שבמועצה האזורית מרום הגליל. נגרם נזק לבית, לא היו נפגעים.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about the Israeli military in Deir al-Balah, Gaza ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl)).

Al Jazeera contains an image of destruction in Gaza ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)).

The sources contain images of destruction in Gaza (<image:14270>, <image:14271>, <image:14272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results confirm that there was Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. The image search also shows destruction in Gaza. The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date (March 2025) or the number of casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the date and the number of casualties.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:39>)
image_search("Israeli bombardment Deir al-Balah Gaza March 2025")
geolocate(<image:39>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:39>

### Evidence from `image_search`
CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about the Israeli military in Deir al-Balah, Gaza ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/middleeast/israel-military-deir-al-balah-gaza-intl)). The Guardian published an image of a building explosion in Gaza ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news)). Al Jazeera contains an image of destruction in Gaza ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)).

The sources contain images of destruction in Gaza (<image:14270>, <image:14271>, <image:14272>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The image search results confirm that there was Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza. The image search also shows destruction in Gaza. The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date (March 2025) or the number of casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the date and the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date (March 2025) or the number of casualties.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the date and the number of casualties.

الصحفي محمد العويد

##### الصحفي محمد العويد ابن محافظة درعا، يتحدث لدرعا 24 عن تحديات وآفاق الإعلام السوري: نحو بناء إعلام حر ومستقل في مرحلة ما بعد النظام

**يشهد الإعلام السوري اليوم مرحلة مفصلية بعد سقوط النظام الذي أحكم قبضته على الصحافة ومؤسساتها لعقود طويلة**، ولا سيما خلال السنوات الثلاث عشرة الأخيرة. ومع هذا التحوّل، انفتح الباب أمام أفقٍ جديدٍ يطمح إليه الصحفيون والمؤسسات الإعلامية في سوريا، لتمكين العمل الإعلامي الحر والمستقل. ومع ذلك، فإن الطريق نحو تنظيم هذا القطاع وضمان حرية التعبير لا يزال مليئاً بالتحديات.

في هذا السياق **أجرت شبكة درعا 24 مقابلةً خاصّة مع الصحفي [محمد العويد](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002329474787)
 من أبناء محافظة درعا**، للحديث عن هذا المشهد والكثير من الأمور المتعلقة به وتحديات وأولويات العمل الإعلامي في هذه المرحلة. يتناول الحوار قضايا مثل واقع الاتحادات التي أُنشئت مؤخرًا، وظروف الناشطين والصحفيين في البلاد، وأداء الحكومة في الجانب الإعلامي، والدور الذي يجب أن تضطلع به المؤسسات الصحفية لدعم التحول الإعلامي في سوريا.

**ينحدر الصحفي محمد العويد، من بلدة معربة في الريف الشرقي من محافظة درعا.** وهو خريج جامعة دمشق قسم الصحافة. عمل مديراً لفرع وكالة سانا في درعا، وفي صحف سورية أخرى قبل اندلاع الثورة في 2011. وعمل بعدها في تلفزيون “سوريا الشعب” الذي أُنشئ في عمّان في الأردن، حيث كان يقيم هناك. بعدها في تلفزيون “18 آذار” للمعارضة السورية. وفي عام 2014، هاجر إلى فرنسا. عمل من هناك مع تلفزيون “أورينت” كمراسل، وكذلك في موقع “زمان الوصل”. كما تعاون مع “تلفزيون سوريا”. وحالياً، ينشر مقالاته في عدد من المواقع الإلكترونية بصفة مستقلة، وليست دائمة.

كيف تُقيّم المشهد الإعلامي في سوريا اليوم بعد سقوط النظام الذي كان يُحكم قبضته بشكل كبير على الإعلام الرسمي وكل وسائل الإعلام في مناطق سيطرته؟ وما هي الآفاق التي تتطلع إليها من الإعلام السوري في المستقبل؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المشهد الإعلامي يعني – مرحليّاً – خلال هذه المرحلة لا يمكن تقييمه بالأدوات الطبيعية المعتادة؛ لأن الكل يشعرون أن هذه المرحلة هي مرحلة انتقالية، مرحلة تأتي بعد انهيار نظام الأسد وهروبه، وحل أكبر مؤسسات الدولة الأمنية والعسكرية. وبالتالي، **حالة الحرية – إذا جاز التعبير – في أوجها، في ذروتها، بدون أي ضوابط، بدون أي قواعد، في حالة من عدم المسؤولية الإعلامية.** لأن هناك سعة أفقية في انتشار الشائعات والمصادر غير المسؤولة، وعدم التأكد من الأخبار في حالة متناقضة بالقدر الذي نرى فيه الوجه الإعلامي الإيجابي من الحريات التي سادت في سوريا بعد فترة كبت طالت أكثر من عقود، نرى أيضاً غياب أدوات الدولة أو مؤسساتها التي يفترض أن تكون هي المصدر الرئيسي لفهم هذه التحولات، أو المصدر الرئيسي للأخبار التي تخاطب الناس أو تكون مصدراً للمعلومات منها.

كيف يمكن بناء إعلام يتمتع بالحرية في سوريا؟ وما هي التحديات التي تعيق تحقيق ذلك في المرحلة القادمة؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بتقديري، أولاً، يفترض أن يتحمل الجميع المسؤولية كشارع، كصحفيين، كنخب سياسية، وأن تكون على قدر المسؤولية. لأن المرحلة لها خصوصيتها، وثانياً، الشكل الطبيعي أن تبادر الناس، أن تبادر هذه القوى المجتمعية في الإعلام والسياسة إلى إعادة ترتيب أوراقها، إعادة ترتيب أولوياتها. وأن تكون إذا لم تكن الشراكة متاحة الآن مع أدوات الدولة أو سلطة الدولة، فلتكن في الجهة المقابلة. لكن تقديري أنها تحتاج بعض الوقت، لأنه الأسباب الموضوعية لغياب هذه الكتل التي يفترض أن تكون صلب أو مقومات الحريات الإعلامية، إن واقع المعارضة بعد العام 2011 لم يكن خاضعاً بالمعنى الحقيقي لبنية المؤسسات. وإذا شاءت ووجدت مؤسسة، فهي تحكم جمهورها السوري المنتشر في أصقاع العالم، في كل دول العالم. **فالآليات التي كانت سائدة خلال فترة المعارضة وإعلامها هي أقرب لمرحلة الفوضى وليس التنظيم**، لأنه أنت لا تحكم في جغرافية محددة، أنت توجّه خطاباً، وردّ هذا الخطاب من الجمهور لا تخضع لأي قواعد.

الآن الفرصة الاستثنائية هي أنه **أصبح للسوريين وطن وجغرافيا يمكن الالتزام بقواعدها وآلياتها،** كما هو في بقية البلدان، بدءًا من الجوار السوري في الأردن أو الشمال التركي، وصولًا إلى دول العالم الآخر. فبتقديري أنه **يجب أن نكون صريحين مع أنفسنا وتتحمل هذه القوى الجديدة مسؤولياتها وأولوياتها وواجباتها ووظيفتها**، من خلال أولاً تنظيم صفوفها، ومن خلال أن تكون هي الرافع الحقيقي للحريات. ولا نعول وننتظر حتى تمنحنا السلطة الحريات على طبق من ذهب.

ما هي الأولويات العاجلة التي يجب على المؤسسات الإعلامية والجهات الفاعلة تحقيقها لضمان حرية الصحافة في سوريا الجديدة؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن ترتيب هذه الأولويات سيكون مرهوناً بوجه السلطة القادمة. على الأقل خلال شهر آذار، سيتم إعلان تشكيل الحكومة، ومن المفترض أن يصدر عن هذا التشكيل لاحقاً – بالتوازي مع المؤتمر الوطني – البيان الدستوري. كما يُفترض أن يصدر معه بعض التعاميم أو القرارات التي تُحدد وتشرح وتؤطر مجموعة القوانين الناظمة للحياة السياسية والإعلامية. لأنه بدون هذا الجانب السياسي أولاً، لا يمكن للقوى السياسية أن تعمل.

بمعنى آخر، في الجانب الإعلامي، ما هي الأطر التي أعمل كصحفي بموجبها؟ هذه الأمور غير واضحة حالياً، لأنه ليس لدي أُطر ولا قوانين، والأمور متروكة الآن. لكن ا**لعاجل، بتقديري، هو أن تتولى القوى السياسية، ومن ضمنها القوى المدنية في الجانب الإعلامي، المسؤولية وأن تتهيأ لهذا الدور**. يجب أن تكون هذه القوى جاهزة، وأن تكون قادرة على ضم كوادرها والاستعداد للمرحلة القادمة. إذا لم تكن المؤسسات الإعلامية متاحة حالياً، فعلى الأقل في المرحلة القادمة، **يجب أن تكون هذه المؤسسات جاهزة إلى جانب المعارضة، وأن يكون لديها خطابها وبنودها التي ستطلبها من السلطة وتتناقش معها حولها،** سواء ما يتعلق بالإعلام أو بحريات الصحافة أو بالقانون الإلكتروني. كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن تبادر الجهات المدنية والصحفيين والنخبة الثقافية إلى تهيئة أوراقها، حتى تكون جاهزة في المرحلة القادمة.

**أعتقد أن أبرز تحدي حالياً هو تأخر السلطة السياسية في إعلان موقفها، على الأقل إعلامياً**. ما هي الأجواء التي ينبغي على الصحافة أن تعمل بموجبها. هل تترك بهذا الشكل غير المنضبط، ولكن في حدود معقولة؟ أم نعود إلى حالة من التنظيم؟ لأن أهم ما في الإعلام – إذا جاز التعبير بين هلالين – هو “لعبة المُشاكسة” مع الحكومة، وكل مُشاكسة تستوجب أن يكون هناك قواعد ضبط بين الطرفين. **للأسف، حتى الآن، غير واضح تماماً ما هي القواعد بين الطرفين. هل هو دستور 2012؟ هل هو قانون المطبوعات السوري؟** يبدو أن الأمور تُركت بهذا الشكل.

**لذلك، أعتقد أن أول الأولويات التي يجب أن تكون حاضرة وهو أن تتهيأ الأطراف المدنية لتلعب هذا الدور، وأن تكون على الأقل جاهزة فيما إذا ذهبت السلطة السياسية إلى اعتماد قانون ما. يجب أن يكون لديها النموذج المقنع والحضور الجماهيري.**

كيف يمكن للإعلام أن يساهم في بناء مستقبل سوريا الجديد؟ وما هو الدور الذي يجب أن تلعبه الحكومة لدعم هذا التوجه؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

جزء من وظيفة الإعلام دوماً أن يلعب دوراً محورياً في أي مجتمع، سواء في سوريا أو غيرها. وبالتأكيد، في الحالة السورية، هذا الدور مُضاعف بسبب الظروف الاستثنائية التي تمر بها البلاد. **في المجتمعات المستقرة، عادةً ما يلعب الإعلام دوراً ضمن قواعد السوق، حيث يكون الدافع هو السبق الصحفي، الشهرة، التسريبات، والعناوين المغرية** التي تجذب الجمهور وتزيد من انتشار المؤسسات الصحفية. هذه الممارسات تعتبر جزءاً من لعبة “العرض والطلب” في السوق الإعلامي.

لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً. **أحد التحديات الرئيسية هو أن الإعلام يجب أن يضع القيمة الأخلاقية في أولوية عمله – أي خبر قد يخلق بلبلة كبيرة في المجتمع السوري -، خاصةً أن بنية الدولة ما زالت هشة وغير مستقرة.** لذلك، أعتقد أن سلم الأولويات في الحالة السورية يجب أن يختلف قليلاً، وأن يُراعى في الحالة السورية **أن تكون الأولوية للبناء وليس فقط للممارسات الإعلامية التي نراها في المجتمعات المستقرة**، والتي لديها باع طويل في تحمّل أعراف الصحافة الجديدة وحقها في السوق. في الحالة السورية، الوضع يحتاج من الإعلامي أن يرتب أولوياته بشكل مختلف، مع **التركيز بشكل خاص على الأولويات الأخلاقية للمهنة.** يجب أن يكون المقياس الأخلاقي والحالة الوطنية، أي: هل تتحمل الناس هذه الأنشطة الصحفية؟ التي عادةً ما تكون حق للصحفي.

بالتالي، لا بأس بتقديري من تعزيز هذه التوصيفات والبنية الأخلاقية في الصحافة، على الأقل مرحلياً، حتى يستقيم بنيان المجتمع السوري وتعود الصحافة إلى دورها الطبيعي.

ما تقييمك للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة الجديدة فيما يتعلق بالإعلام؟ وكيف يمكن للإعلام أن يلعب دوراً رقابياً على أداء الحكومة في هذه المرحلة؟ وهل تتقبل الحكومة هذا الدور؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بالنسبة للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة، **حتى الآن لم تتخذ خطوات حقيقية**. ما نراه هو الطبيعي. بعد تحرير دمشق، حيث أن دمشق بأهميتها، التي تعتبر مأساة القرن، نحن أمام مشهد بالغ الأهمية من الطبيعي أن يستقطب كل الإعلام العالمي والمؤسسات الإعلامية. **أعتقد أن الإدارة المؤقتة ربما سهلت – إذا جاز التعبير – أو تعاطت مع الأمر بإيجابية، لأنها تريد إيصال رسالة مفادها أن هذه المرحلة تختلف عن مرحلة الأسد، التي كانت تتطلب الموافقات الأمنية وزيارات الفروع الأمنية،** وكانت هناك محدودية في قدرة الصحف والمؤسسات على العمل بحرية.

**الإدارة الجديدة قدمت رسالة سياسية أكثر من كونها إعلامية**، لأن الناس في الإعلام تنتظر بنية إعلامية وقانونية واضحة حتى تستطيع أن تستمر، وحتى تعرف ما هي الأرضية الصلبة التي تقف عليها. هذا الأمر ضروري حتى تستطيع أن تلعب دورها الرقابي على الإعلام، وهذا هو المطلوب. لكن موقف الحكومة حتى الآن – وهذا نعزوه للظرف الذي تمر به الإدارة الجديدة، وهي مرحلة انتقالية أو حتى ما قبل الانتقالية – لأنها استلمت بلداً ينوء من الخراب في كل هياكله، بما فيها الهياكل الإعلامية.

**سواء قبلت الحكومة الدور الرقابي للإعلام أم لم تقبله، فاعتقد أنه إذا استطاعت القوى الإعلامية والمنظمات الصحفية وكتلة الصحفيين والمثقفين أن تكون جاهزة ومنظمة لهذا الدور**، فسيقوم الإعلام بأداء دوره الرقابي بشكل طبيعي، ولكن ضمن الأطر والشروط التي سيتم الاتفاق عليها في المرحلة القادمة.

ما هي أبرز الأولويات التي يجب على الإعلاميين السوريين التركيز عليها خلال الفترة الانتقالية؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بالأولويات، أعتقد أنه من الصعب أن أكون جزءاً من الحالة الصحفية وفي نفس الوقت أطالب بإنهاء حالة الفردية وتعزيز القيم الأخلاقية لمهنة الصحافة. أفهم أن الأمر ليس سهلاً، لأن الصحفي يعيش كما الشاعر ليقول فيها للناس: “ها أنا هنا كصحفي، لدي سبق، لدي تحقيق، لدي… إلخ”. لكن الحالة السورية، بما أنها حالة وطنية استثنائية، تستوجب سلم من الأولويات مختلفة قليلاً.

بدلاً من أن تكون الأولوية لدي كصحفي أو كمؤسسة إعلامية هي السبق الصحفي، يجب أن تكون الأولوية للقيمة الأخلاقية والمسؤولية الوطنية (كما أسلفت). هذا لا يعني إنهاء دوري كصحفي، بل يعني الانتقال من الحالة الفردية إلى حالة من المشاورة والتعاون مع زملائي في العمل ومع المؤسسة الإعلامية التي أنتمي إليها، ومؤسستي لديها تشبيك مع مؤسسات أخرى، وبالتالي نعيد ترتيب الأولويات بما يتناسب مع خصوصية الحالة السورية.

وهذا يعزز الدور المؤسساتي للإعلام ويعطي صورة أفضل من الصورة السابقة. قبل 13 سنة، **كنا نعيش حالة فردية، بل وحتى حالة فصائلية في الإعلام. الآن، نحن أمام حالة وطنية تستوجب الدقة والتعاون مع الآخرين أكثر من أي وقت مضى**. هذه الحالة تستوجب التركيز على القيم العليا، وأولها القيمة الوطنية وقيمة المواطنة والحريات. كل هذا يتطلب تخفيف حالة التفرد والذاتية التي نمارسها عادةً كصحفيين.

ما هو رأيك بالأفكار التي تدعو لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام – أسوةً بكثير من دول العالم – كخطوة لدعم حرية الصحافة؟ وهل تعتقد أن هناك بدائل أفضل لتنظيم القطاع الإعلامي؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

في قضية **الدعوة لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام، أعتقد أن هذا الطرح مبكرٌ جداً، خصوصاً في الحالة السورية**. صعوبة الأسئلة المطروحة اليوم، سواء كانت إعلامية أو سياسية أو دينية، وكل البرامج المقدمة، لا تراعي بشكل كافٍ الحالة الاستثنائية التي تمر بها سوريا. إذا نظرنا إلى دولة مستقرة مثل المملكة الأردنية، يمكن أن يثار نقاش حول إلغاء وزارة الإعلام، لأن هناك بنى مدنية ومؤسساتية قائمة منذ أكثر من خمسين سنة. لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً.

**يجب أن نفهم خصوصية الحالة السورية البالغة الحساسية. القوى القادمة من المعارضة، والتي ستُدير البلد بشكل أو بآخر، لم تكن منضبطة خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية**. كانت هذه القوى مشتتة. لكن لأول مرة الجغرافيا السورية ستتعامل معها ضمن أطر قانونية. أنا في فرنسا، ملتزم بقانون الإعلام الفرنسي، لكني لست ملتزماً بالقانون التركي. الآن، في سوريا، أصبحت ملتزماً بالحالة السورية ككل. لأول مرة، تتاح فرصة لأن يكون المرسل والمستقبل في جغرافية واحدة تحكمها القواعد نفسها. هذا يحتاج إلى تأطير وإنهاء المرحلة السابقة التي كانت قائمة على الفوضى وعدم الانضباط.

ليس هناك قانون يحكم العلاقة بين تلفزيون سوريا في تركيا (الذي يعمل في المنطقة الحرة ولا يخضع للقوانين التركية) وبين جمهوره في أمريكا أو لبنان أو الأردن أو حتى داخل سوريا. الآن، لأول مرة، يفترض أن تتاح لعبة إعلامية مهمة جداً، حيث **يلتزم كل من المرسل والمستقبل بقواعد تندرج تحت قانون الإعلام السوري والقانون العام السوري بضوابطه وقواعده وتعريفاته**. هذا يحتاج إلى جهد كبير حتى نعتاد عليه.

في المراحل القادمة، بعد استقرار الدولة، **إذا رأى أهل التشريع أن البلد لم تعد بحاجة إلى وزارة الإعلام، فليكن ذلك. أنا مع دعاة توسيع مجال الحرية بلا حدود أمام المؤسسات الإعلامية، لكن في الحالة السورية، أقف وأشعر بالخوف. هذه الحالة هي أكثر الحالات التي تستوجب الضبط والقوننة، وليس العكس.**

كيف ترى الخطوات التي تُتخذ اليوم التي تهدف لتوحيد الإعلاميين والصحفيين في عدة مناطق في سوريا وتأسيس اتحادات؟ هل ترى أن هذا يساهم في توحيد الخطاب الإعلامي وتنظيم العمل، أم أنها قد تؤدي إلى تهديد حرية التعبير وطمس التنوع الإعلامي؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

مسألة توحيد الإعلاميين وتأسيس اتحادات، الأصل في ذلك أنه مباح والضروري والمهم، **لكنني شخصياً متخوف من جملة المشهد الإعلامي ومعطيات المشهد السياسي**. عادةً، في بلاد الشتات، اعتدنا أن أي مجموعة تعمل اتحاداً، وهذا الاتحاد يشابه – للأسف – الحالة السياسية أو أي حالة أخرى من التجمعات السورية. السبب في ذلك هو إنّه لم يكن لدينا “بيت” بالمعنى الحقيقي، فكنا نلجأ إلى وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والتعميمات المفتوحة، مع غياب القواعد الحقيقية.

**الخوف الآن هو من الاستسهال في المشهد السوري. بمعنى أنه غداً أو بعده، سنرى اتحادات صحفية في كل محافظة، وفي العاصمة دمشق، ستظهر اتحادات بأسماء متعددة**. المشكلة أن هذه الاتحادات، للأسف، هي استمرار للحالة السابقة، واستمرار للحالة التي كانت قائمة في الشتات. 

وهنا لا أريد أن يفهم كلامي كهجوم على أحد من زملائنا، **لكني أرى أن الإشكالية الحقيقية هي أننا نحاول صناعة “نمور من ورق” مجدداً، في حين أن الفرصة اليوم متاحة في دمشق لصناعة “نمور حقيقية”**.

بمعنى أن الراغبين في العمل السياسي والإعلامي، إصبح لدينا الآن وطن وبيت يمكننا اللقاء فيه، ولم نعد بحاجة إلى الأساليب القديمة التي تركت آثاراً سلبية. هذه فرصة حقيقية لبناء اتحادات قائمة على قواعد واضحة وفهم مشترك للآليات والدوافع.

النقطة الأهم هي أننا الآن أمام بيت، لكن الواجبات كثيرة. يجب أن نبدأ بتأثيث هذا البيت، تجميله، وتقديمه للجمهور. هل كل من في هذا البيت متوافق معك على الرؤية والقواعد والشروط والأولويات؟ من فهمي، أرى أن إشكالية الاتحادات التي تعلن عن نفسها بشكل متسارع تشبه إلى حد كبير القوى السياسية. ربما هذا بسبب خصوصية المرحلة، أو الظروف الراهنة، أو الرغبة في المشاركة، وهذا كله صحيح. لكن شخصياً، **أميل إلى أن قواعد وآليات تأسيس الاتحادات والروابط يجب أن تكون مختلفة عما يجري على أرض الواقع. لأنه لأول مرة سنكون أمام بُنى ستعتمد على ذاتها، وليس على دعم أو رعاية من هنا أو من هناك**. هذا البيت يجب أن يعتمد على اشتراكات الأعضاء. **هل الأعضاء في الحالة السورية جاهزون لهذا؟** أتمنى ذلك. هل الأعضاء سيكونون في حالة من الانضباط المؤسسي؟ أتمنى ذلك أيضاً.

بمعنى أن الاتحاد بهيكليته سيكون صاحب الموقف، وليس كل عضو بمفرده. الاتحاد سيكون ممثلاً للأعضاء، وهذه الجزئية لم نعتد عليها خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية، حيث كانت الاتحادات التي نشأت عبارة عن صفحات تواصل اجتماعي، وبالتالي كانت أدوات ضبط الأعضاء غير ممكنة، فكيف تضبط أنا في فرنسا والآخر في تركيا والثالث في أمريكا والرابع في سوريا. الفرصة الآن هي أن أصبح هناك بيت يجمع الجميع، وهي فرصة تاريخية. لكن يجب أن نبادر كصحفيين إلى استثمار أقصى طاقاتنا في هذا الجانب.

ما أبرز التحديات التي تواجه الصحفيين في درعا في المرحلة الحالية، وكيف يمكن للإعلام المحلي أن يساهم في إيصال صوت المجتمعات المحلية للحكومة وللعالم؟ وما هو مستقبل العمل الصحفي في درعا وسوريا؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بوضع درعا، هي جزء من الكل السوري. إذا استطاعت درعا أن تواكب الحالة الإعلامية السورية العامة، فهذا أمر جيد ويُحسب لها. بالتأكيد، أ**ي إعلام محلي يساهم في وصول صوت جمهوره أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يحاول أن يكون صوته.**

التحديات في درعا تشبه التحديات في المشهد الإعلامي السوري ككل. مرة أخرى، نحن أمام لحظة فارقة: أصبح لديك بيت بعد أن كان أعضاء هذا البيت، من الأب إلى الأبناء، مشتتين في كل أنحاء العالم. ولأول مرة، يستوجب بناء هذا البيت حضور الجميع ومشاركة الجميع. لكن يبدو أن ثمة ظروفاً أو معيقات ستكون عائقاً أمام اكتمال هذه العائلة. هذه المشكلة تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في درعا، كما تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في عموم سوريا.

بمعنى، ماذا عن الزملاء الآخرين؟ هل سيعودون؟ هذا غير واضح. وماذا عن المؤسسات القائمة وكوادرها؟ ما هي الخيارات ؟ هذا أيضاً غير واضح. وماذا عن النشطاء الذين هم جزء كبير من المشهد الإعلامي السوري اليوم؟ حملوا أرواحهم على أيديهم وضحوا، ولدينا تضحيات جسيمة، نقف أمامها بإجلال. لكنه سؤال مرّ يحتاج إلى وضوح وإجابة: **ماذا تفعل أمام كتلة لا يستهان بها من الشباب من النشطاء الإعلاميين؟ ما هي الخيارات؟ هل تقول لهم “كفيتم ووفيتم”؟ بالتأكيد، هذا لا يستقيم. يجب أن نستفيد من تجربتهم، أولاً هذا حقهم أن يكونوا جزءاً من المشهد القادم، لكن ضمن أي شروط؟ ضمن أي معطيات؟**

كل هذه الأسئلة تشكل تحديات كبيرة تحتاج إلى إجابات. وأنا بتقديري أن الأهم هو أن تكون هذه المجموعة أو هؤلاء الصحفيين هم من يثيروا هذه الأسئلة، وهم من يعبر عن أدواتهم، ويعرفوا عن هويتهم. كل هذه الأسئلة يفترض أن يصوغوها هم، بمساعدة الآخرين، بمساعدة زملائهم السابقين، وبالتشبيك بين بعضهم. لكن عليهم هم أن يثيروا هذه الأسئلة.

ما هي رسالة محمد العويد للصحفيين في درعا؟ وكيف يمكنهم أن يكونوا أكثر فاعلية في المشهد؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المهم جداً هو أن يعمل كل ناشط، كل مواطن صحفي، وكل مهتم بالشأن الإعلامي في المحافظة، ويبادر بالتشبيك مع الآخرين من زملائه. **المهم الآن هو أن يفهم الجميع أن الأصوات الفردية لن يكون لها جدوى في المرحلة القادمة**، حتى لو كان مشهور أو ذو باع طويل لن يحقق شيئاً، لأن الأصوات الفردية لن تكون ذات جدوى أمام هذا المشهد بالغ التطور والمتسارع، والذي يعاد بناؤه في سوريا.

المشروع بهذا الحجم، على مستوى الوطن السوري، يحتاج بالمقابل إلى أن يكون هناك روافد أو أجنحة، وليس حالات فردية. **أنا من دعاة الحالة الجماعية في هذا المعنى. للصحفيين في درعا، وللمهتمين بالشأن الإعلامي**، أن تكون الدعوة دائمة إلى لقاءات دائمة على مدار الشهر أو الأسبوع، يتم فيها طرح هذه الأسئلة، تبدأ من الهوية: من نحن؟ ماذا ينتظرنا؟ ما هي حقوقنا؟ كيف نعمل؟ ما هي مصلحتنا؟ أن نشبك مع بعضنا البعض؟ هل نعمل كأفراد؟ كل هذه الأسئلة واستحقاقاتها مهمة، وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك محاولات للحصول على أجوبة لها، وليس أن تبقى مجرد أسئلة في الفضاء المفتوح. لأن التحديات كبيرة، والحقوق كثيرة. بدلاً من الحالة الفردية، التي من مشاكلها أنها تقبل أحياناً باللا شيء (مثلاً، أن تكون مراسلاً في درعا لمؤسسة في دمشق وأن يُقبل)، لكن بالحالة الجمعية أن يسأل ويكون خلفه مؤسسة أو مجموعة تسأل ما هي حقوقه.

يجب أن نعي أن المرحلة القادمة، حتى في حالة المواطن الصحفي، لم يعد من المقبول التطوع. العمل الإعلامي يجب أن ينتهي بهذه الطريقة. **العمل الإعلامي هو عمل يومي، مضني، إشكالي، بجوانبه المتعددة قانوني، وأحياناً يضعك في مواجهة السلطة أو الشارع.** كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن يكون ما يحميها، بدءاً من الجانب التعويض المالي وصولاً إلى الحقوق داخل المؤسسة التي تعمل بها.

لذلك، أنا أميل إلى ضرورة الحالة الجمعية بين الناس والتكاتف فيما بينها، وإثارة كل هذه الأسئلة. في المشهد السابق، **هناك متطوعون، وشهدنا مئات وعشرات الشهداء الذين لا نعرف الآن من هي المؤسسات أو الجهات التي ستعنى بهم أو بعوائلهم أو بأبنائهم**. مرحلة الاستقرار في سوريا اليوم تختلف. إذا كنت مواطناً صحفياً، يجب أن تسأل أولاً: ما هي حقوقي لدى المؤسسة التي أتعامل معها أو التي أتطوع لأجلها؟ هذا أبسط الأسئلة. لم يعد المشهد كما في السابق، حيث كنا نعتمد على العفوية أو النخوة. الآن، انتقلنا إلى مرحلة المأسسة. المأسسة تختلف، لأنك تتعامل مع مؤسسة، وأولى الأشياء التي يجب أن تُطرح هي: ما هي حقوقي؟ ما هي واجباتي؟ ماذا عليّ؟ وماذا لكم؟ هذه الأسئلة تريح الطرفين وتساعد على بناء علاقة مستقرة وطويلة الأمد.

**من وجهة نظري، يفترض أن يتعاون الجميع في هذه المرحلة. هذه واحدة من التحديات، وربما أهمها.**

قصف إسرائيلي على أهداف سورية - صورة أرشيقية من موقع المرصد السوري

أعلنت وزارة الدفاع السورية تفاصيل العدوان الجوي الذي شنته قوات الاحتلال، اليوم السبت، على العاصمة دمشق.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع السورية، في ما نشرته على لسان مصدر عسكري عبر صفحتها الرسمية على موقع فيسبوك، أنه في «حوالي الساعة 1:35 من فجر اليوم السبت، نفذ العدو الإسرائيلي عدوانا جويا من اتجاه الجولان السوري المحتل مستهدفا بعض النقاط في محيط مدينة دمشق».

وأضاف المصدر: «تصدت وسائط دفاعنا الجوي لصواريخ العدوان وأسقطت معظمها، واقتصرت الخسائر على الماديات».

بيان وزارة الدفاع السورية

وفي وقت سابق، اليوم السبت، ذكرت وسائل الإعلام الرسمية السورية أن إسرائيل شنت هجوما جويا على محيط العاصمة السورية دمشق.

كما أفادت وسائل الإعلام السورية بسماع دوي انفجارات متتالية في دمشق.

وذكر موقع روسيا اليوم أن الدفاعات الجوية السورية نجحت في التصدى لأهداف معادية في أجواء محيط العاصمة دمشق، موضحا أن الانفجارات القوية بدأت في الساعة 01:35 بتوقيت دمشق، مشيرا إلى أنها استمرت دقائق عدة.

#### **غزة تواجه الإبادة**

ولليوم الـ57، يواصل الاحتلال عدوانه على قطاع غزة الذي بدأ في السابع من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بعد قيام المقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عملية طوفان الأقصى، بمنطقة غلاف غزة، وبعد انتهاء الهدنة الإنسانية المؤقتة في القطاع، صباح يوم الجمعة، وهو اليوم الـ56 للعدوان.

وتتواصل الغارات التي تشنها مقاتلات الاحتلال، مما أدى إلى ارتقاء آلاف الشهداء والجرحى.

وأعلن المكتب الإعلامي الحكومي في غزة، أمس الجمعة، ارتفاع عدد الشهداء إلى 15 ألفا و110 فلسطينيين، بينهم 6150 طفلا و4000 سيدة.

وذكر المكتب الحكومي، في بيان، أن عدد شهداء الكوادر الطبية بلغ نحو 207 أطباء وممرضين ومسعفين، كما استشهد 73 صحفيا.

وزاد إجمالي عدد الإصابات عن 37 ألف حالة، أكثر من 75% منهم من الأطفال والنساء.

وأوضح أن إجمالي عدد البلاغات عن المفقودين تحت الأنقاض بلغ 6500 بلاغ، فيما بلغ إجمالي عدد الوحدات السكنية التي تضررت كليا أو جزئيا 300 ألف وحدة، إلى جانب استهداف 266 مدرسة، وخروج 26 مستشفى من الخدمة فضلا عن تدمير 56 سيارة إسعاف.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Al Jazeera article states that Israel claims the Iron Dome is 90 percent effective. However, this is a general claim about the system's effectiveness, not specifically about the October 1, 2024, attack. The ABC News article discusses the Iranian attack and the Iron Dome but does not provide an interception rate.

The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence suggests the Iron Dome is highly effective, it does not confirm the 90% interception rate for the specific attack on October 1, 2024.

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:2108>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.
    
    For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, possibly involving tents. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search results show that similar images of fires have been associated with Israeli strikes.

The claim's veracity cannot be determined without additional information. Specifically, it is necessary to verify the origin of the image and the context in which it was taken.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

An analysis by Truemedia, a tool that detects digitally manipulated images, indicates that the image is most likely AI-generated.Image: Screenshot truemedia.org

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Bilder fra kjønns­skifte­operasjon delt som «bevis» på israelsk suksess
=======================================================================

I løpet av det siste året har volumet av manipulert informasjon fra Midtøsten blitt stadig større. Her kan du se hvordan de prøver å lure deg.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister. However, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

The provided evidence includes articles and images of Smotrich, but none of them are related to the claim's specific scenario. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date and location, is needed.

The new evidence from the image search provides an article from The New York Times about the conflict between Israel and Lebanon. However, the article does not contain the image from the claim, nor does it mention Bezalel Smotrich or a bomb shelter.

The evidence does not provide any information to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the image's context, including the date, location, and the presence of Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack, is still needed.

The fact-check reveals that while Bezalel Smotrich is indeed the Israeli Finance Minister, the provided evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows him in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024. The search results provide articles and images of Smotrich but lack any context related to the specific scenario described in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. `false`

## Summary

The claim cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms that Bezalel Smotrich is the Israeli Finance Minister, the search results do not provide any information about the context of the image, specifically whether it depicts Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

PesaCheck has looked into a post shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home filmed by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 and finds it to be MISSING CONTEXT.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The image was also found on the website [https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7) and [https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `image_search`
Haaretz published an article about Benjamin Netanyahu's seaside villa, including an aerial view of the house (<image:14326>). Siasat.com also contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's house (<image:14327>). The Aviationist published an article about an attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house, including an image of the house (<image:14328>).

## Elaboration
The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house and was taken in 2019, according to a fact-check. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article. The image was also found on the website [https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7).

The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but the claim about the source and date of the image is false. The image was not taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but the claim about the source and date of the image is false. The image was not taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.

`false`

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

**Family “didn’t know”**
------------------------

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

**children, victims of the regime**

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

!Félix Maradiaga <image:4682>

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

!Gulbahar Haitiwaji <image:4684>

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

!Abdulrahman Almawwas <image:4699>

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble in Armanaz, Idlib, after an earthquake on February 7, 2023. This contradicts the claim that the image shows a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. The evidence also includes images and articles about the situation of children in Gaza, but none of them are related to the image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

!Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018. <image:5759>

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Human Rights Watch report from September 5, 2007, includes an image of a man holding a framed photo (<image:14354>). The search result from palinfo.com contains an image of two children (<image:14355>). Al Jazeera published an article about children killed in Gaza (<image:14356>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza killed at least 16 people (<image:14360>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:14361>). The UNRWA website has no relevant content.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contains images and reports related to the claim. Specifically, the image search results include images of children and reports of attacks on UN schools in Gaza. However, the evidence does not directly confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names and ages of the children, the date of the event, or the exact location (Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp).

The evidence does mention an Israeli attack on a UN school, which aligns with part of the claim. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to verify the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, I cannot fully verify the claim based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific details.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:63>)
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
There is no new evidence to verify the claim. Therefore, I cannot assess the veracity of the claim.


## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida killed Israel")
image_search("Al-Jaoni UN school Al-Nuseirat refugee camp July 6 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Human Rights Watch report from September 5, 2007, includes an image of a man holding a framed photo (<image:14354>). The search result from palinfo.com contains an image of two children (<image:14355>). Al Jazeera published an article about children killed in Gaza (<image:14356>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports that an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza killed at least 16 people (<image:14360>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:14361>). The UNRWA website has no relevant content.


## Elaboration
The evidence contains images and reports related to the claim. Specifically, the image search results include images of children and reports of attacks on UN schools in Gaza. However, the evidence does not directly confirm the specific details of the claim, such as the names and ages of the children, the date of the event, or the exact location (Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp).

The evidence does mention an Israeli attack on a UN school, which aligns with part of the claim. However, the evidence does not provide enough information to verify the specific details of the claim.

Therefore, I cannot fully verify the claim based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the specific details.
