Content: Military Times published an article on February 7, 2024, about a drone strike in Baghdad, which includes an image of a burning car (<image:14072>).

Useful result: From [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/07/politics/us-carries-out-an-airstrike-in-baghdad): 
Content: CNN published an article on February 7, 2024, about a US airstrike in Baghdad, including an image of a destroyed vehicle and people at the scene. <image:14073>

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While image searches revealed attacks on US facilities in Baghdad and a burning car, none of the images matched the one in the claim. Furthermore, a reverse image search yielded no results, and geolocation analysis did not identify Iraq as a likely location. Therefore, the claim that the image depicts a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, is unsubstantiated.

So, the overall veracity is: false
