The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/us-uk-sanction-senior-houthis-as-rebels-say-red-sea-attacks-will-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/us-uk-sanction-senior-houthis-as-rebels-say-red-sea-attacks-will-continue)), indicates that the Houthi rebels have stated that their attacks in the Red Sea will continue, directly contradicting the claim. There is no evidence to support the assertion that they ceased operations after Trump's election.

So, the overall veracity is: false
