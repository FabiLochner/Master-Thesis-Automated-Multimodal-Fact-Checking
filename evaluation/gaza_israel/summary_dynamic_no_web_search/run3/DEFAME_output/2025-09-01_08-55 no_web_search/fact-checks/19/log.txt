Useful result: From [Source](https://www.siasat.com/trump-netanyahu-meeting-focuses-on-hostages-saudi-relations-iran-threats-3175717/): Found exact image on website with title: Trump, Netanyahu meeting focuses on hostages, Saudi relations ...
Content: The Siasat.com article, published on February 4, 2025, reports on a meeting between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. <image:16> is the same image as the one in the article. The article discusses the meeting's focus on hostages, Saudi relations, and concerns about Iran.

The claim '<image:16> This is an authentic image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu and Elon Musk during Netanyahu's official visit to the U.S. in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image depicts Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk, the evidence suggests that the image is not authentic. The reverse image search found the image in an article about a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, but Elon Musk was not mentioned.

So, the overall veracity is: false
