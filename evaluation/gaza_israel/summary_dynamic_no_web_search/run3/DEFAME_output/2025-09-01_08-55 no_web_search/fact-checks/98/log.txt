Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html): 
Content: The Yahoo News article fact-checks a fake image of Dwayne Johnson. <image:14364>

The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is false.
Justification: The image of Dwayne Johnson with the Israeli flag is likely not authentic. While Johnson has commented on the Israel-Hamas conflict, there is no evidence to support the claim that he posed with the Israeli flag. A fact-check of a fake image of Johnson was also found ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
