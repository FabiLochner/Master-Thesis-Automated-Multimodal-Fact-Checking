## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the exploded iPhone (![image 31](media/56.jpg)) is featured in multiple articles discussing explosions in Lebanon. One article from DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061)) fact-checks the claim, stating the image is old and unrelated to the September 2024 attacks. Another article from ITC.ua ([https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/](https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/)) discusses explosions targeting electronic devices, including iPhones, and includes the image (![image 343](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846049-318073.jpg)).

The China Academy ([https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/](https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/)) also uses the image (![image 31](media/56.jpg)) in an article about the "pager attack," claiming it caused a trust crisis among Chinese consumers.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an article about Hezbollah device explosions, including an image of a burning vehicle (![image 14227](media/2025-09-01_09-14-1756718064-333358.jpg)). NPR published an article on September 28, 2024, about Israel striking Hezbollah (![image 14228](media/2025-09-01_09-14-1756718066-257643.jpg)).

Reuters published an article on September 27, 2024, about the ceasefire discussions in Lebanon, including an image of a large explosion in the sky (![image 14229](media/2025-09-01_09-14-1756718067-536974.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The image of the exploded iPhone (![image 31](media/56.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image is associated with explosions in Lebanon, but the claim that it is directly related to the September 2024 attacks and caused by pager attacks is not fully supported. The image is old and has been used in different contexts. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image of the exploded iPhone (![image 31](media/56.jpg)
