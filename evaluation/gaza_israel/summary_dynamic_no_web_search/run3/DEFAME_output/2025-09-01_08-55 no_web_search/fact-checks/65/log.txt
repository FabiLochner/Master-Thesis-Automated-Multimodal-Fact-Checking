The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts destruction in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, consistent with reports of Israeli bombardment. However, the exact date (March 2025) and the specific number of casualties (at least four Palestinians) cannot be verified with the available evidence, leading to a "false" verdict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
