Useful result: From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israel-strikes-houthi-targets-yemen-one-day-after-tel-aviv-drone-attack): 
Content: Al-Monitor reports on an Israeli strike on Houthi targets in Yemen, one day after a drone attack on Tel Aviv. <image:14348>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/21/us-foreign-policy-fails-again-this-time-against-the-houthis): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on July 21, 2024, discussing the US foreign policy failures against the Houthis. The article includes an image of explosions. <image:14349>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a crowded airport in Israel, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While there were attacks and explosions related to the Houthis around that time, the search results do not mention any attacks on the airport. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
