The claim 'For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence confirms the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, as reported by sources like the [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-30/iran-says-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-was-assassinated-in-tehran) and [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-reportedly-assassinated-tehran-00172019). However, the fact-check did not find any information to support the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
