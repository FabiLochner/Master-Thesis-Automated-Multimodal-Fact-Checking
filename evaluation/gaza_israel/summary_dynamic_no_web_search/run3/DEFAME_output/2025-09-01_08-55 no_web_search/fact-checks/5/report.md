## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares was found in multiple sources. One source, from The Times of Israel, mentions the image in an article about an attempt by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell to down an Israeli military helicopter near Gaza City in May 2019. The article also mentions an Israeli helicopter downed by Hezbollah in 2006. Another source, PesaCheck, states that the image's context is missing and that it is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon. A third source, Arab News PK, uses the image in an article about Israeli airstrikes on Hamas targets in Gaza in March 2019.

The sources are: [https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/), [https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03), and [https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The ABC News website published an article on October 14, 2024, about a Hezbollah drone attack that killed four Israeli soldiers, including an image of an Israeli helicopter (![image 14049](media/2025-09-01_08-57-1756717054-661899.jpg)). CNN published an article about Israel and Hezbollah, which also contains an image of an Israeli helicopter (![image 14050](media/2025-09-01_08-57-1756717055-305706.jpg)).

The provided sources do not contain information about an Israeli helicopter being shot down by Hezbollah on November 23, 2024, as depicted in the claim image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been used in different contexts, including an article about an attempt to down an Israeli helicopter in 2019 and an article about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The image search did not provide any information about an Israeli helicopter being shot down by Hezbollah on November 23, 2024.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is misrepresented and the event described did not occur. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim has been used in different contexts, including an article about an attempt to down an Israeli helicopter in 2019 and an article about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The image search did not provide any information about an Israeli helicopter being shot down by Hezbollah on November 23, 2024. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.
