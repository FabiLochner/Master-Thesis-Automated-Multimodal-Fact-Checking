The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: The image of Greta Thunberg holding the sign is authentic and has been used in articles discussing her activism, as evidenced by articles from sources like [NDTV.com](https://www.ndtv.com/) and [The Ecologist](https://www.theecologist.org/). However, the claim that the image is from November 2024 is not supported by the evidence, as the articles featuring the image were published in October and November 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
