The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of discussions between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire, and also between Kamala Harris and Netanyahu on the same topic, there is no evidence to support the specific claim about Trump's statements or the date of the phone call.

So, the overall veracity is: false
