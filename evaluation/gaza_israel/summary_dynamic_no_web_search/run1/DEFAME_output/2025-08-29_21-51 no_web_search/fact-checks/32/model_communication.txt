# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/): Found exact image on website with title: US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
Content: "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed while standing on the balcony of his safe house in Afghanistan when a CIA drone sent two Hellfire missiles to pulverize the terror leader and plotter of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The precision strike took place in the heart of downtown Kabul during the early hours Saturday, ending a 21-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden’s successor and marking the most significant US counterterror operation since the 2019 slaying of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The terror leader had stepped onto his balcony in the Shirpur neighborhood of Kabul when the US drone fired two specially designed RX9 Hellfire missiles dubbed “sword bombs” due to the blades that allow the weapon to tear through metal and walls without destroying entire structures.

President Biden confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death during an evening address in which he declared, “Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more.”

“Now we make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide: If you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,” Biden said.

Biden said of al-Zawahiri, “For decades, he was the mastermind behind the attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more.”

“He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats and American interests.”

 [!Map of drone strike <image:7049> 7](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/kabul-strike-new.jpg "Open a slideshow of all 7 article images.")

The drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death near Kabul.

None of al-Zawahiri’s family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties, the president said, calling the mission to eliminate the terrorist leader a “total success.”

The president also warned: “To those around the world who have continued to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.”

Biden’s remarks from the Blue Room balcony of the White House were reminiscent of President Barack Obama’s late-night announcement of the death of bin Laden in Pakistan more than 11 years ago.

“After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents \[George W.\] Bush, Obama and \[Donald\] Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year,” Biden said.

“He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike to remove him from the battlefield once and for all.

“This mission was carefully planned and rigorously to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him.”

Biden added: “We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone. And we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”

“You know, it can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re gonna see to it that won’t happen,” he said.

“This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can and will always make good on that solid, solid pledge.

Fox News, citing two intelligence sources, first reported on the death of the Egyptian-born surgeon who took over the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11 attacks after bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in 2011.

Al-Zawahiri had a $25 million bounty on his head over his indictment in the 1998 embassy bombings.

He’s also believed to have helped coordinate the atrocities that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., 21 years ago, which were masterminded by bin Laden and planned by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pending trial by a military tribunal.

Biden addresses the successful operation in Afghanistan from the White House Monday night. Reuters

Current and former officials began hearing Sunday afternoon that he’d been killed in a drone strike, sources told the Associated Press, but the administration delayed releasing the information until his death could be confirmed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid [confirmed in a statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1554187982407696387)
 Monday that a drone strike on a home in Kabul had taken place the day before.

The house was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior intelligence official told AP, raising questions about whether al-Zawahiri had received sanctuary from the Islamist group following the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.

The official added that a CIA ground team and aerial reconnaissance conducted after the drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death.

A senior Biden administration official noted: “Haqqani Taliban members took actions after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location.”

“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike,” the official said.

“The safe house used by Zawahiri is now empty.”

The Taliban spokesman said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.

“Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region,” Zabihullah wrote.

“Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.”

Al-Zawahiri ascended in al Qaeda after bin Laden was killed in 2011. AP

Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden are believed to have met in the late 1980s, when al-Zawahiri reportedly treated the Saudi millionaire in the caves of Afghanistan as Soviet bombardments shook the mountains around them.

Al-Zawahiri merged his group of Egyptian militants with bin Laden’s al Qaeda in the 1990s, and photos from that period often showed the two men sitting side by side.

Bin Laden provided al Qaeda with charisma and money, but al-Zawahiri brought tactics and organizational skills needed to forge militants into a network of cells in countries around the world.

“The strong contingent of Egyptians \[in al Qaeda\] applied organizational know-how, financial expertise, and military experience to wage a violent jihad against leaders whom the fighters considered to be un-Islamic and their patrons, especially the United States,” Steven A. Cook wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations last year.

There have been rumors of al-Zawahiri’s death for several years, but a video that surfaced in April showed him praising an Indian Muslim woman who had defied a ban on wearing a hijab, or headscarf.

That footage was the first proof in months that he was still alive.

As with bin Laden, al-Zawahiri’s whereabouts had been unknown before the operation that led to his death, though the most common rumors placed him either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan’s near-lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border.

Biden last year in an address said that US does not need to be on ground to fight terrorists. Last Sunday, the CIA showed how it can be done by killing Ayman al-Zawahiri

The US planned to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri over a period of several months. On July 31, 2022, two Hellfire missiles fired using a US drone ended the life of the al-Qaeda chief while he was sitting outside in his balcony, mincing him into shreds but without any damage to other individuals.

The CIA officials who were involved in the mission, according to _the Associated Press_, constructed “a pattern of life" and knew that Ayman al-Zawahiri liked sitting on the balcony of his building, which is located in Kabul’s Sherpur area.

Once his daily routine was established by the officials, they presented it to US president Joe Biden in the White House’s Situation Room weeks before the attack.

The officials were also aware that the Haqqani Taliban network provided the housing to Ayman al-Zawahiri and his family in Kabul. The AP reported that Zawahiri’s family along with him started living in the house once the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021.

People familiar with the developments told _CNNNews18_ that the building is close to Iranian and Turkish embassies.

After the US officials confirmed these details, they took more months to formulate an action plan. Several independent teams of analysts were brought on board to ensure that nearby civilians and infrastructure should not be targeted.

Another official familiar with the developments said that the now deceased al-Qaeda leader’s identity was verified on multiple occasions and for sustained periods of time before getting approval for the attack.

The plans were first formed in early April when two senior national security officials were first briefed on the intelligence. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan was then apprised of the developments. Over the next two months, a small group of officials of the US government vetted the intel and devised options for US president Biden.

Biden, when apprised of the developments in July, shortly after he returned from his Europe trip, bombarded CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Centre director Christy Abizaid regarding the accuracy of the data presented to him.

Biden made it clear that the attack should not lead to results like the 2021 drone attack that ended up killing civilians in Kabul. He also said that Afghans who helped the US should not be in jeopardy.

Biden gave the go-ahead after July 25, while he was recovering from Covid .

The success of the attack was confirmed when the Haqqani Taliban network restricted access to the safe house and relocated Zawahiri’s family.

“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians," Biden said in his address where he confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader, who headed the terrorist group for more than a decade, was eliminated.

The house where Al-Qaeda emir Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed, 31 July 2022

Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 71-year-old emir of Al-Qaeda, was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, on 31 July 2022—one year ago today. Al-Zawahiri’s long life involved in Islamic militancy is interesting in itself, and can tell us a lot about where the jihadist movement is and where it is trending, notably his intellectual evolution towards a more “localist” program and the clash with the Islamic State, and perhaps even more immediately—in terms of his successor as Al-Qaeda’s leader—the relationships Al-Zawahiri fostered with various States, specifically Pakistan and Iran.

**JIHAD AT HOME**


-------------------

Al-Zawahiri was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 19 June 1951 to a [prominent elite family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
: one of his great-uncles, Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, was the first general-secretary of the Arab League between 1945 and 1952, and his grandfather, Rabia al-Zawahiri, had been the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, once the most prestigious institution in the Sunni world before it became a drab adjunct of the military regime. Al-Zawahiri got involved with Islamic militancy early in his life, [joining](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism)
 the Muslim Brotherhood in 1965 while he was at school, aged 14. Al-Zawahiri’s ideological devotion cannot be doubted: this was at the nadir for Egypt’s Islamists—albeit this turned out, as he had no way of knowing, to be the darkness before the dawn.

The Brotherhood and like-minded groups had welcomed the military coup in July 1952 that liquidated the gentle Western-aligned monarchy, hoping that it would lead to Islamic government. It swiftly became apparent they had miscalculated: pan-Arabism would be the creed of the new order. In 1954, the Soviet-aligned ruler, Gamal Abdel Nasser, initiated a severe crackdown on the Brotherhood that [they call](https://eeradicalization.com/the-history-and-ideology-of-the-muslim-brotherhood-an-interview-with-joas-wagemakers/)
 the _mihna_ (inquisition). The Brotherhood’s leading ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was arrested at this time, accused (probably correctly) of trying to assassinate Nasser. Qutb was released in May 1964, but [arrested again](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
 in August 1965, accused of trying to overthrow the government. 17,000 Islamists were [swept up](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in the 1965-66 crackdown. In August 1966, Qutb was sent to the gallows.

The Islamists, however, were on the eve of an event that would hand them victory in the struggle with the pan-Arabists. Perhaps the central organising principle of pan-Arabism was the intention to uproot the Zionist project. The Arab States tried, after the restoration of Israel in 1948, to, in the infamous phrase of the era, “[throw the Jews into the sea](https://aijac.org.au/australia-israel-review/scribblings-a-sea-change/)
”. They failed, but the war continued by other means, with efforts to economically suffocate the Jewish State, a cross-border terrorist campaign,[1](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-1-135614300)
 and political warfare, notably via the [Palestine Liberation Organisation](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-palestinians-and-the-plo/)
 (PLO) after 1964, an instrument that would in due course [pass to the Soviets](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/why-putins-regime-says-jews-are-the)
. In June 1967, Nasser—in collaboration with Syria and Jordan—[made a play](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nasser-s-speech-to-the-egyptian-national-assembly-may-1967)
 to “deal with the entire Palestine Question”. Nasser’s failure was no less calamitous than 1948-49. The Israelis pre-empted the attack and pan-Arabism was shattered alongside the armies of the two radical republics, Egypt and Syria.

If Islamism was not quite born on the seventh day of the Six-Day War, it was then that it began to [move into the mainstream](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-return-of-islam/)
. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, a course had been set for reform and various ideas imported from Europe—Nazism, Communism, nationalism—were tried towards that end. All had only made things worse. The Islamist narrative that it was this ethos of foreign-inspired change that was at fault, that the answer was to return to the indigenous faith, always had its plausibility and appeal—and spoke in a language most could understand, rather than in the alien terms of imported Western ideologies. Now it appeared a verdict had been rendered from heaven.

History was breaking the Islamists’ way. In September 1970, Nasser, their great tormentor, died, and his successor, Anwar al-Sadat, had bigger problems. Egypt was being colonised from within by the Soviet Union. In 1972, Al-Sadat [ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/why-sadat-packed-off-the-russians-egypt.html)
 the Soviet intelligence “advisers” and troops out. In the shadow of the 1968 [Soviet invasion of its dissident Czechoslovak colony](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/socialism-could-never-have-a-human)
, there was no guarantee the Soviets would leave. The Soviets decided to comply, but initiated an active measures campaign to destabilise Al-Sadat’s regime, including a subversion offensive through Egypt’s internal Communist activists and agents.[2](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-2-135614300)
 To counter the Left, Al-Sadat tilted towards the Islamists: he would style himself “the Believing President”,[3](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-3-135614300)
 and, after the Brotherhood [formally renounced](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg31367/html/CHRG-115hhrg31367.htm)
 violence, it began various forms of cooperation with the State. Many Islamists were released from prison, including, in October 1971, [Muhammad Qutb](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
, who built on his brother’s ideas to [develop concepts later taken on](https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/06/13/sectarianism-of-islamic-state-ideological-roots-and-political-context/j1iy)
 by the jihadi-Salafists.

This caused some splintering among the Islamists, as more radical factions broke away from the Brotherhood to form clearly anti-State organisations—some of which [also received Soviet support](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/)
. Probably the most powerful of these groups at the time was the **Islamic Group (**_**Jamaat al-Islamiyya**_**)**. Another, which Al-Zawahiri joined in 1973, was **Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ)**. The Jamaat and EIJ were rivals to an extent, though they often collaborated. Umar Abd al-Rahman, “the Blind Shaykh”, would become firmly associated with the Jamaat a decade later, but in the mid-1970s the nature of these networks made his [allegiances rather more fluid](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 and, even after the 1980s, EIJ set great store by Abd al-Rahman as a spiritual guide.

Al-Zawahiri, who had earned his medical degree in 1974 from Cairo University, was involved in the [Military Technical College revolt](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in 1975. In 1978, Al-Zawahiri [gained](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
 a surgical master’s degree.

The **Islamic Revolution in Iran** reached its crescendo in late 1978, right as Al-Sadat was signing the peace accords that made Egypt the first Arab State to recognise Israel. Unwilling to shed blood to save his throne, the [Shah left his country](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/01/17/the-fall-of-the-shah-and-the-rise-of-islamism/)
 in January 1979 and in March 1980—after a grisly international journey—settled in Egypt; four months later he was dead. If the Six-Day War lit the touchpaper, the Shah’s fall kindled Islamism into a blaze: the seemingly most powerful ruler in the region—the one most unapologetically aligned to the West and Israel—had been brought down and replaced with an Islamist regime. The dream was possible.

The Islamists in Iran had been [assisted by Soviet-run Communists](https://www.meforum.org/62821/whither-iran-tehrans-russian-connection)
 during the Revolution and afterwards. For a time, [some even thought](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-shahs-view-of-the-revolution)
 the Red would triumph over the Black. By 1983, Ayatollah Khomeini ruled supreme, having destroyed his main Islamist rival, the [even-more radical](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/central-intelligence-agency-august-1981-iran-the-mujahedin-a.k.a.-mujahideen-e-khalq-or-mek.pdf)
 Mojahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), and the various organised Leftist factions. The Marxist inflection in Khomeini’s Revolution remained, however, visible in the way it cast itself as a movement on behalf of the _mostazafin_ (oppressed). The other key part of this was its non-sectarianism: Khomeini was Supreme Leader of the _Islamic_ Republic; in time, it was hoped, the Sunnis would see their error. Pending that, the Shi’a clergy would work with Sunni militants to export their Revolution.[4](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-4-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri became a “[poster boy](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-mullahs-manhattan-project/)
” for Iran’s revolutionary clergy. The relationship Al-Zawahiri forged with Tehran four decades ago lasted throughout his lifetime. Sometimes the mutual admiration [was even public](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3506544/Iran-receives-al-Qaeda-praise-for-role-in-terrorist-attacks.html)
.

In October 1981, the Islamists that Al-Sadat had given space to struck him down. “I have killed Pharaoh”, [announced Al-Sadat’s murderer](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1984/05/31/the-egyptian-murder-case/)
, Khaled al-Islambuli. “I am not afraid to die.” And die he would, shot by a firing squad in April 1982. The Iranian regime named a street in its capital after Al-Islambuli, celebrating him as a “martyr”.[5](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-5-135614300)
 Al-Islambuli was a [member of EIJ](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ310/html/PLAW-115publ310.htm)
 and had been assisted in getting to Al-Sadat by a colonel in his retinue, Abud al-Zumar, the first leader of EIJ. Al-Zawahiri was arrested in the dragnet that followed Al-Sadat’s assassination, which rounded up hundreds of Islamists. Al-Zawahiri was not charged with conspiring in the murder itself; he was [convicted of weapons charges](https://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/zawahiri/profile.html)
. When Al-Zawahiri was [released in 1984](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-islamist-militancy/in-free-egypt-jihad-leader-says-time-for-gun-is-over-idUSTRE72H62820110318)
, in his early 30s, he left Egypt and would never return.

**JIHAD ON THE ROAD**


-----------------------

In December 1979, the Soviet Union conquered Afghanistan and installed a puppet Communist regime. **Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency** used the Mujahideen groups it had created from Afghan Islamists a half-decade earlier to run an insurgency against the Soviet occupation.[6](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-6-135614300)
 By 1982, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia began sponsoring the Afghan anti-Soviet resistance,[7](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-7-135614300)
 but this was channelled through Pakistan’s ISI, which empowered its own assets, above all Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most radical of the Islamists, whose ideology later fed into the global jihad movement.[8](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-8-135614300)

In 1984, a Palestinian shaykh, **Abdullah Azzam**, issued a _fatwa_ calling on all Muslims to fight the Soviets, and it provoked the first major foreign fighter flow, mostly of Arabs, to Afghanistan. Azzam created the Services Bureau (_al-Maktab al-Khidamat_), funded most significantly by Usama bin Laden, to facilitate this movement of foreigners. The “Arab-Afghans” did not receive direct State support for the simple reason that they were not an important military force in fighting the Soviet occupation: about 2,000 Arabs total (400 at any one time) were in Afghanistan amidst a Mujahideen force of perhaps a quarter-million.[9](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-9-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri in his memoir is furious at the idea that the U.S. gave “one penny” to the Arab-Afghans.[10](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-10-135614300)
 The three battles in the late 1980s where the Arab-Afghans had a noteworthy contribution were military failures, but politically raised the profile of the Arab-Afghans,[11](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-11-135614300)
 and the politics among the Arab-Afghans was to have global significance.

In October 1986, Bin Laden created a military camp, the Lion’s Den of Supporters (_al-Masada al-Ansar_), which many simply called “the military base” (_al-Qaeda al-Askariyya_). It was out of the bureaucratic structures for the Masada camp that Al-Qaeda emerges around the spring of 1987: initially, “Al-Qaeda” referred to the camp and quickly evolved into a synonym for the _people_ associated with the camp, a group of Arab fighters operating as something like a special forces unit.[12](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-12-135614300)
 While Masada was to a degree established deliberately in isolation, physically and culturally, from the broader Mujahideen insurgency,[13](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-13-135614300)
 it had deep ties to some Mujahideen factions—[above all the Haqqanis](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
—that were very close to Pakistan’s ISI.[14](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-14-135614300)

In this period, the Arab-Afghans were diverging. Al-Zawahiri believed in the legitimacy of _takfir_ (excommunicating Muslims), especially against Arab rulers, in contrast to Azzam’s pan-Islamism that opposed _all_ Muslim-on-Muslim violence. The degree to which Al-Zawahiri was influencing Bin Laden in the late 1980s might be overstated,[15](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-15-135614300)
 but Azzam was certainly losing influence.[16](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-16-135614300)
 As the [Soviets wound down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/04/15/agreement-on-afghanistan-signed-in-geneva/c7288c64-6764-4e73-9bc5-7eeb48f7827d/)
 in Afghanistan in 1988, Azzam wanted to redirect the energy from the Afghan jihad to Palestine, for a war to eliminate Israel, an alien occupying power in his conception. Al-Zawahiri had a different script in mind: he wanted to separate the Arab-Afghans from even indirect allegiance with Muslim governments and have them war against the regime in Cairo, believing jihad should lead to the founding of a caliphate, starting in Egypt, “the heart of the Islamic world”.[17](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-17-135614300)
 The contest between Al-Zawahiri and Azzam ended as decisively as it dramatically in November 1989, when Azzam was killed in a highly public, highly mysterious bombing in Peshawar. The perpetrator remains unknown, but [Al-Zawahiri is on the suspects list](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/a-jihadi-murder-mystery-who-killed)
.

1991 was an important year in the development of Al-Qaeda. At the beginning of the year, the U.S.-led coalition—for once without Soviet opposition—reversed the annexation of Kuwait by Saddam Husayn’s Iraq. The Saudi government rejected Bin Laden’s call to “fight \[Saddam\] with faith” (his motley force of Arab-Afghans),[18](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-18-135614300)
 and in April 1991 Bin Laden left Saudi Arabia for the last time, moving to Pakistan.[19](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-19-135614300)
 The same year, Al-Zawahiri [took over EIJ](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/egyptian-islamic-jihad)
, which was now less a group than a dispersed network of Egyptian militants abroad. And at the end of the year, the Soviet Union collapsed. For the jihadists, this was their victory, and the Soviet demise was the destruction of the more dangerous of the two infidel superpowers; dealing with America, made soft by self-indulgence and decadence of all kinds, would be comparatively easy. “Hit them and they will run”, [Bin Laden repeatedly said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/09/10/targeted-by-a-history-of-hatred/13108985-1814-4aee-b74c-6767f131f03e/)
, citing the U.S. abandoning South Vietnam and Beirut after the Iran/Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in October 1983. Somalia would be added to the list after the U.S. withdrew from there in 1993.

Bin Laden [arrived in Sudan in December 1991](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/al_qaeda_sahel.pdf)
,[20](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-20-135614300)
 travelling from Afghanistan. Bin Laden had first been invited to Sudan by Hassan al-Turabi, the Muslim Brotherhood cleric who was the power behind the throne, soon after the military coup by Islamist officers in June 1989.[21](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-21-135614300)
 Bin Laden had not immediately taken the offer but had cultivated relations with Al-Turabi and begun setting up Sudan as a node in Al-Qaeda’s network. In 1990, “agents of Bin Laden began to buy property in Sudan”.[22](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-22-135614300)
 When Al-Turabi [went to Jordan](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-mother-of-all-connections)
 in October 1990 to show support for Saddam, two months after Saddam had occupied and annexed Kuwait, Al-Turabi’s entourage included Bin Laden emissaries who [established contact](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 with Saddam’s regime. In 1991, [Saddam returned the favour](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, reaching out to Al-Qaeda through Sudan. Once Bin Laden was in Sudan, Al-Qaeda became fully intertwined with the Islamist regime, providing resources for its civil war against the Christians in the south, in exchange for Al-Qaeda receiving safe haven and the amenities of a State, like passports.

Al-Zawahiri was not “formally” a member of Al-Qaeda at this time, and was still, as emir of EIJ, a leading proponent of the “near enemy” school of jihad: direct war with the Muslim regimes to establish Islamist emirates that could link up into a caliphate. Bin Laden was moving towards the “far enemy” strategy, the idea that a global war against the American-led West was needed first, to push it out of the Middle East, because only then could Islamic revolutions locally succeed. The distinction between the “near enemy” and “far enemy” camps was never as sharp as all that, though, demonstrated by Al-Zawahiri acting as Bin Laden’s roving ambassador in the first half of the 1990s and the training Al-Qaeda gave to “near enemy”-focused jihadists in the Afghan camps later in the decade.[23](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-23-135614300)

Al-Zawahiri, had made a [trip to Tehran in April 1991](https://ctc.usma.edu/marriage-of-convenience-the-evolution-of-iran-and-al-qaidas-tactical-cooperation)
 to gain financial support and training for an Islamic revolution in Egypt. Probably in early 1992, via Al-Zawahiri, Bin Laden [met with](https://kyleorton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/united-states-v-ali-mohamed-plea-hearing-20-october-2000.pdf)
 Imad Mughniya, the officer of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in military control of Hizballah in Lebanon, to arrange for Al-Qaeda jihadists to receiving training. **This Al-Zawahiri-facilitated meeting was the start of an ever-deepening [relationship between Al-Qaeda and Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
** that lasts to this day. Also in 1992, [Al-Zawahiri met with Saddam’s foreign intelligence chief](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, Faruq Hijazi, in Khartoum, beginning a “highly secretive relationship with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and later with Al-Qaeda”. Contact was [maintained](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 between EIJ/Al-Qaeda and Saddam’s Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) through Hijazi in Sudan up to 1995, with additional meetings in Pakistan, and occasional visits by Al-Qaeda and affiliated jihadists to Baghdad, including Al-Zawahiri, who [went to the Iraqi capital](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/03/25/the-great-terror)
 in 1992 to meet Saddam himself.

The fact that Sudan in the 1990s acted as a nexus for Al-Qaeda and its jihadist allies with two notorious State-sponsors of anti-American terrorism, Saddam’s Iraq and Clerical Iran, was [well-known even in public discourse](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
, though it would later be “forgotten” that everyone knew this when political imperatives shifted.

**Al-Zawahiri arrived in Bosnia as early as September 1992**,[24](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-24-135614300)
 and would cycle in and out of the country over the next three-and-a-half years as part of the foreign jihadist contingent that was heavily inflected with Al-Qaeda operatives. In Bosnia, Al-Zawahiri [worked closely with Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/01/23/from-bosnia-to-guantanamo/)
, which trained and utilised the jihadists in the war, and [embedded itself](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/02/05/iran-admits-collaborating-with-al-qaeda-in-bosnia/)
 in the [security apparatus](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/01/21/the-jihad-factor-in-bosnia/)
 of the Sarajevo government. The expanding web of jihadist connections and Iran’s assistance meant **the Bosnian war helped Al-Qaeda go truly global**.

In Yemen, Bin Laden’s [ancestral homeland](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/rags-to-riches-story-of-the-bin-laden-family-is-woven-with-tragedy)
, Al-Qaeda would fail to incite an Islamic revolution, but laid down infrastructure that served it as a logistics hub. This, too, was assisted by Iran, which had created its own Islamic revolutionary clone in Yemen on the Hizballah model, Ansarallah (a.k.a. the Huthis).[25](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-25-135614300)
 The key operative for Al-Qaeda’s establishment in Yemen was a senior official of Al-Zawahiri’s EIJ, **Ibrahim al-Banna (Abu Ayman al-Masri)**,[26](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-26-135614300)
 who went to Yemen,[27](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-27-135614300)
 [probably in 1993](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/an-al-qaeda-commander-comes-out-from-the-shadows.php)
, under instructions from Al-Zawahiri and Al-Qaeda’s then-military emir, **Ali Amin al-Rashidi (Abu Ubayda al-Panjshiri)**, who had [just spent ten months](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/al-qaedas-first-military-emir/)
 in Yemen. Al-Zawahiri [personally visited Yemen](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 in 1994 to check on Al-Banna’s progress. Al-Banna set about forging relationships with local jihadist leaders and tribes, and [worked closely](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/twenty-years-after-9-11-the-jihadi-threat-in-the-arabian-peninsula/)
 with the IRGC’s Ansarallah, acquiring weapons and other forms of support to smuggle operatives into Saudi Arabia, seeding the networks that Al-Qaeda used to launch a jihadist revolt in the Kingdom from 2003 to 2005.[28](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-28-135614300)
 The beaten Saudi Al-Qaeda operatives would retreat to Yemen and merge with their Yemeni network to form Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the third of Al-Qaeda’s “affiliates”, Al-Banna having helped set up the first in Iraq that we now know as the Islamic State.[29](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-29-135614300)

 AQAP’s security and intelligence chief, and AQAP [retains](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)
 its relationship with Ansarallah/Iran.

In May 1996, Bin Laden had been expelled from Sudan, under American pressure, and moved to Afghanistan, where [the ISI had switched to the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/08/17/pakistan-and-the-taliban/)
, after tiring of the Mujahideen, as its favoured instrument for colonising the country. Bin Laden came to a similar arrangement with the Taliban regime as he had in Sudan, only with deeper foundations, practically and [ideologically](https://www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda%E2%80%99s-quasi-caliph-the-recasting-of-mullah-%E2%80%98umar/)
: Bin Laden pledged allegiance (_bay’a_) to Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Umar as Commander of the Faithful (_Emir al-Mumineen_). The U.S. had miscalculated in having Bin Laden forced out of Sudan. It transpired to be more advantageous for Al-Qaeda to be in Afghanistan.

There were two other major jihadi hotspots in the mid-1990s into which Al-Qaeda inserted itself, in [Algeria](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/03/21/algerias-years-of-blood-not-quite-what-they-seem/)
 and Chechnya. **Al-Zawahiri’s trip to Chechnya, in southern Russia, in December 1996, is [one of the strangest episodes](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/08/how-russia-manipulates-islamic-terrorism/)
 in the history of the jihadi-Salafist movement**. Al-Zawahiri was arrested soon after his arrival, alongside [Ahmad Salama Mabruk](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/10/04/al-qaeda-in-syria-and-american-policy/)
 (Abu Faraj al-Masri) and Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi, and imprisoned until May 1997. Al-Zawahiri was then let go and allowed to continue his work among the jihadists in the Caucasus, before rendezvousing with Bin Laden in Afghanistan. The Russian claim that it only later learned Al-Zawahiri’s identity is not credible. Moscow had surely come across Al-Zawahiri in the 1970s, when it was [covertly supporting EIJ](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/#.VEWC9vnF_jU)

 as a prisoner in 1982. If the FSB, the KGB’s successor, had not recognised Al-Zawahiri by sight, it likely would have learned it in interrogation. Al-Zawahiri had [broken under torture](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304569504576403503586643690)

**MOVING TO GLOBAL JIHAD**


----------------------------

Al-Qaeda had been [linked to terrorist attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4677978)
 against the West earlier in the 1990s—the hotel bombings in Yemen in December 1992, the first World Trade Centre attack in New York in February 1993, in Somalia during the “Black Hawk down” incident in October 1993, the foiled 9/11 precursor “Bojinka plot” in January 1995, and the bombing against U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia in November 1995—but it was only after Al-Zawahiri’s Russian sojourn that he got on board with the “far enemy” strategy. Bin Laden had issued his [first fatwa](https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Declaration-of-Jihad-against-the-Americans-Occupying-the-Land-of-the-Two-Holiest-Sites-Translation.pdf)
 declaring jihad against American in August 1996 and in February 1998 issued a second fatwa—by some accounts “encouraged” by Al-Zawahiri[30](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-30-135614300)
—that [declared all-out war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/saudi-arabia/1998-11-01/license-kill-usama-bin-ladins-declaration-jihad)
 against Americans and Jews globally. The 1998 statement was inter alia [signed by Al-Zawahiri](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm)
 and [Rifai Taha](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/01/20/the-coalition-strikes-down-al-qaedas-leaders-in-syria/)
 (Abu Yasser al-Masri), then-operational head of the Jamaat since “the Blind Shaykh” was in prison.

The bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed two-hundred people, made Al-Qaeda a household name, at least in Western security circles. Al-Zawahiri was [personally implicated](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/18/alzawahiri.charges/)
 in the atrocities. The support of the Iranian regime [had been important](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 in making the East Africa Embassy bombings possible and now Tehran was sure that Al-Qaeda meant business in its war with America, the relationship only deepened.

By 1998, Iran was not the only actor intensifying its interest in the increasingly lethal Al-Qaeda: Saddam was, too. Whether or not [Bin Laden himself had gone to Iraq](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 in January 1998, in February 1998—three weeks before the fatwa declaring war on America and Jews—Al-Zawahiri had gone to Baghdad again, meeting Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan “to arrange for coordination between Iraq and bin Laden”: there was talk of establishing training camps for Al-Qaeda on Iraqi territory and Al-Zawahiri was given $300,000.[31](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-31-135614300)
 By February 1998, the U.S. and Saddam were several months into a showdown that [seemed likely to end](https://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/17/transcripts/clinton.iraq/)
 with a U.S. invasion to depose Saddam. Saddam was ultimately [rescued by Kofi Annan](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/08/19/the-legacy-of-kofi-annan/)
 of the United Nations, but the danger never completely passed—the [Senate voted unanimously](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655)
 to make it official U.S. policy to remove Saddam from power in October 1998—and Al-Qaeda was clearly viewed as a handy potential instrument for retaliation. In March 1998, two separate Al-Qaeda envoys went to Saddam’s Iraq,[32](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-32-135614300)
 one of them [spending more than two weeks in Baghdad](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
. At least one of the March 1998 meetings was “apparently arranged through … Zawahiri, who had _ties of his own_ to the Iraqis” \[italics added\], and it seems to have been Al-Zawahiri who arranged for a Saddamist “delegation” to visit Afghanistan in July 1998 to meet, “first with the Taliban and then with Bin Laden”.[33](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-33-135614300)
 ([Saddam and the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/29/saddam-and-the-taliban/)
 also had independent relations.) The Saddam-Al-Qaeda relationship became important in late 1998 as Al-Qaeda’s relations with the Taliban faltered.

After the August 1996 fatwa, Taliban emir Mullah Umar, partly under pressure from Saudi Arabia, one of only three States to recognise the Taliban government, had asked Bin Laden to cease public incitement against America and generally keep a low profile.[34](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-34-135614300)
 Bin Laden clearly ignored this, for example giving [an interview to Peter Arnett](https://edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/12/05/gen.arnett.cnna/index.html)
 of _CNN_ in March 1997, where Bin Laden infamously threatened America live on television, and after the Embassy bombings in August 1998 Bin Laden did another media blitz claiming responsibility, ensuring that retaliatory strikes fell on Taliban Afghanistan. The IIS station in Iraq’s Pakistan Embassy [became](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 Saddam’s “point of contact with Al-Qaeda” by late 1998. Two IIS officers [went into Afghanistan](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 in December 1998 to meet Bin Laden, Al-Zawahiri, and Mullah Umar. Later in the month, shortly after President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing campaign (Operation DESERT FOX) against [Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) infrastructure](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/22/why-was-there-ever-an-american-occupation-of-iraq/)
, Hijazi, by this point Iraq’s ambassador in Turkey, also journeyed to Afghanistan to meet Bin Laden. Hijazi [returned](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 for another visit in January 1999. What is most interesting, especially in retrospect, is that these 1998-99 moves in the Saddam-Qaeda relationship were [all reported in real time](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
 in Western newspapers that denied any such relationship existed three years later.

The culmination of Saddam’s interplay with Al-Qaeda was a proposal in early 1999 for Bin Laden and his organisation, including Al-Zawahiri, to move to Iraq. The U.S. was especially trepidatious about Bin Laden taking shelter under Saddam’s roof because it would have made U.S. plans to kill the Al-Qaeda leader—then at their height—impossible. The U.S. was in a catch-22, however, because if it operationalised an assassination mission against Bin Laden, this would be discovered by Pakistan, which would detect the U-2 flights needed to locate Bin Laden before airstrikes were launched, and the ISI would then tip-off Bin Laden, triggering his move to Iraq before any bombing run could take place—putting him out of the U.S.’s reach.[35](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-35-135614300)
 This limbo created by the Pakistanis persisted essentially up to 9/11.

Bin Laden ultimately decided not to take the Iraqi offer and patched things up with the Taliban, agreeing to cease his media appearances: this was partly [under criticism](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/14/al-qaeda-central-in-syria/)
 from senior Arab jihadist figures like **Muhammad al-Bahaya (Abu Khalid al-Suri)** and **Mustafa Setmariam Nasar (Abu Musab al-Suri)**, partly because 9/11 was in the works and he needed less American attention, and partly because the U.S. strikes on Afghanistan after the Embassy bombings had, [unbeknownst to everyone at the time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1028236160532452080)
, reconciled the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, becoming “a rallying point for defiance of America and shut off Taliban discussion of expelling the militants”. The Taliban had never been opposed to anti-American terrorism; they had told Bin Laden he was quite at liberty to “fight America”, but they had insisted he should “do so without much talk and shouting from our lands”.[36](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-36-135614300)
 Bin Laden finally did as he was told. In October 2000, Al-Qaeda carried out its last major pre-9/11 attack, blowing up an American warship, the U.S.S. _Cole_, in the Aden harbour, killing seventeen servicemen: Bin Laden was nowhere to be seen—and nor was any American response.

Al-Zawahiri was involved in the efforts Al-Qaeda made to construct WMD in Afghanistan in 2000-01, including acting as a link for the recruitment of experts from Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Indonesia, led by Al-Qaeda operative Riduan Isamuddin, born [Encep Nurjaman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/us/politics/guantanamo-bali-bombing.html)
, and universally known as “Hambali”.[37](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-37-135614300)
 (There was an Iraq dimension to this story, too, around Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, which later became [the subject of much controversy](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/28/the-cia-and-iraq-intelligence-failures-media-successes/)
.)

The architect of the 9/11 plot was Khaled Shaykh Muhammad (KSM), a Pakistani citizen, who had been involved in the Mujahideen war against the Soviets and the Bosnian jihad. KSM had then been involved in various Islamist terrorist plots across the world. KSM was the uncle of the lead conspirator in the World Trade Centre attack in 1993, Ramzi Yusef, with whom he had planned the Bojinka operation,[38](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-38-135614300)
 which also [involved Hambali](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/individual/nurjaman-riduan-isamuddin)
. In January 1996, KSM moved to Afghanistan, establishing contact with Al-Qaeda’s military chief, [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and through Atef attained a meeting with Bin Laden soon after he arrived in Afghanistan months later, where “KSM presented the Al-Qaeda leader with a menu of ideas for terrorist operations”.[39](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-39-135614300)
 At this first meeting, KSM proposed the “Planes Operation” that would become 9/11. Bin Laden listened “without much comment” and asked KSM to join Al-Qaeda and move his family to Afghanistan.[40](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-40-135614300)
 KSM refused to give _bay’a_ to Bin Laden and left his family in Iran, moving them to Pakistan in January 1997.[41](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-41-135614300)
 Contact waned between KSM and Bin Laden through 1997, but, after the East African Embassy bombings, KSM got back in touch with Bin Laden and “sometime in late 1998 or early 1999”, Bin Laden gave the “green light” for the 9/11 operation.[42](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-42-135614300)

The 9/11 plot was an “off-the-books operation” within Al-Qaeda: the executive body, the Consultation Council (_Majlis al-Shura_), was kept in the dark.[43](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-43-135614300)
 **Only three people—Bin Laden, KSM, and Atef—“developed \[the\] initial list of targets”**.[44](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-44-135614300)
 **Al-Zawahiri was the next to be brought into the plot**,[45](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-45-135614300)
 tasked with trying to find “potential sponsors in the Gulf”.[46](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-46-135614300)
 (It had been inter alia a lack of money that had made Bin Laden hesitant about the “Planes Operation” when KSM first proposed it in 1996.)

While KSM never would formally join Al-Qaeda, Al-Zawahiri did, **[merging EIJ](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/16/the-man-behind-bin-laden)
 with Bin Laden’s outfit in June 2001**. There are two notable things about this. First, EIJ’s sense of itself as a “[national-revolutionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413161153/http:/www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda-revives-its-beef-with-the-islamic-state/)
” group remained strong enough that a large section refused to follow Al-Zawahiri and split away. Second, the merger primarily served as an attempt to stack the _Shura_ so Bin Laden could gain its retrospective approval for 9/11. Six of the nine _Shura_ seats were held by EIJ members loyal to Al-Zawahiri when Bin Laden revealed his plan to attack America to it on 27 June 2001, though it never actually came to a vote: the discussion exposed so much dissent, even among the Egyptians, that Bin Laden declared “the matter had already been decided” and ended the meeting.[47](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-47-135614300)

At [8:46](https://timeline.911memorial.org/#Timeline/2)
 on the morning of 11 September 2001, Al-Qaeda smashed a plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre. By just after 10:00, planes had struck the South Tower and the Pentagon, and Flight 93 was brought down by a passenger revolt near Shanksville in Pennsylvania. Half-an-hour later, the Twin Towers were a heap of rubble. 3,000 people were dead and 25,000 had been wounded.

The U.S. demanded the perpetrators, specifically Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri,[48](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-48-135614300)
 be handed over, and the Taliban, [encouraged by Pakistan](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
, decided it would rather give up its regime than surrender Bin Laden to the Americans. On 7 October 2001, the U.S. began the invasion of Afghanistan. Atef was killed in mid-November 2001, the first major scalp of the War on Terror. Shortly afterwards, Al-Zawahiri [“favourite” wife](https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
, Azza Ahmed Nuwair, was killed in an airstrike, along with two of his children, a source of personal bitterness against the Americans that Al-Zawahiri has repeatedly made reference to.

Cornered at Tora Bora, Al-Qaeda was [rescued by Pakistan and Iran](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
: the Pakistanis drew away their troops, intended to prevent escape as the Americans closed in, for a confrontation with India, and the Iranians deputised Hekmatyar—who had put himself in the service of the IRGC after the ISI discarded him for the Taliban—to bring Al-Qaeda’s military and religious leadership, and Bin Laden’s family, to safety within Iran.

Bin Laden kept on the move over the next four years, reportedly first basing himself in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan, where he met Iranian agents in Shegal to enquire about recovering his family from Iran and sometimes slipping over the border to Karachi,[49](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-49-135614300)
 before moving into the north-western tribal areas of Pakistan, cycling through towns like Shangla,[50](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-50-135614300)
 Haripur, and ultimately settling in the compound where he was found in Abbottabad in August 2005.[51](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-51-135614300)
 Pakistan would play dumb about the Qaeda presence in Abbottabad in 2011, but, in 2004, no less a person than then-Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, [wrote in his memoir](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 that he knew of a network of Al-Qaeda safehouses in the town, one of which contained “someone important in Al-Qaeda”. After KSM was [arrested](https://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/)
 in a CIA-led operation in March 2003 in Rawalpindi, near the Pakistani capital, in the home of a senior official of one the ISI-supported political parties, Jamaat-e-Islami, he was replaced as head of external operations by Mustafa al-Uzaybi (Abu Faraj al-Libi). The ISI has [publicly acknowledged](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 searching a house in Abbottabad looking for Al-Uzaybi as early as 2003 and Al-Uzaybi was eventually captured in Mardan, a town two hours west of Abbottabad, not far from the old Arab-Afghan “capital” of Peshawar.

For much of the last twenty years, Al-Zawahiri’s “[whereabouts \[have\] … been a mystery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/01/zawahiri-al-qaeda-killed/)
”. The one reasonably solid lead on Al-Zawahiri’s hideout came after Al-Uzaybi [disclosed in custody](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pakistan-demands-no-airstrike-repeat/)
 that shortly beforehand he had met with Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in the Bajaur area of what was then the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in north-west Pakistan. **One of the first U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan targeted Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in January 2006** during what was believed to be [a meeting with Faqir Muhammad](https://ctc.usma.edu/a-profile-of-tehrik-i-taliban-pakistan/)
, the deputy leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or “Pakistani” Taliban after its official announcement in 2007. How close the U.S. got to Al-Zawahiri that day is contested. The main takeaway from the incident was how intimately tied TTP is to Al-Qaeda and by extension the rest of the ISI network that includes the “Afghan” Taliban and the so-called [Haqqani Network](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
.[52](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-52-135614300)
 Making the point in a different way, a lot of [circumstantial evidence over the years](https://medium.com/@asfandyarmir/where-is-ayman-al-zawahiri-fb37e459c6a9)
 points to Al-Zawahiri having been under TTP protection in eastern Afghanistan. There was a claim around 2016 that Al-Zawahiri had “shifted his permanent base to Iran”.[53](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-53-135614300)
 This was evidently untrue: a visit, perhaps even an extended one, is certainly possible—a Taliban leader was [killed in the same period](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/death-of-mullah-mansoor-highlights-talibans-links-with-iran)
 returning to Pakistan from Iran—but he clearly did not stay there.

**LEADING AL-QAEDA: REBELLION FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN**


--------------------------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri was [named](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11489337)
 as Al-Qaeda’s new emir on 16 June 2011, six weeks after the U.S. Navy SEALs caught up with Bin Laden. The organization Al-Zawahiri took over was an international network very different to the special forces-type outfit Bin Laden founded in 1987. In the first decade of the twentieth century, Al-Qaeda had expanded beyond its military assistance mission for the Arab-Afghans in Afghanistan to provide such services to local insurgencies abroad, recognising some of these as branches or “affiliates” under a [system it called “Al-Qalim”](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/14/the-structure-of-al-qaeda/)
. The [first branch in 2004](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/bitstream/handle/10066/4757/ZAR20041017P.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y)
 was **Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQM)**, which had a [complicated relationship](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 with Al-Qaeda Central (AQC) after 2006 until AQM was [cast out](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/03/21/ayman-al-zawahiri-expels-isis-from-al-qaeda/)
 by Al-Zawahiri in 2014 and renamed itself the Islamic State (IS). In 2006, with [help from](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/world/africa/01transcript-droukdal.html)

, and the jihadist insurgency in Somalia had been under AQC’s command since [at least this time](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2009/11/al_qaeda_names_fazul.php)
, but Bin Laden [advised](https://kyleorton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bin-Laden-Letters.pdf#page=35)
 **Harakat al-Shabab al-Mujahideen** to keep its allegiance secret, which it did [until 2012](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16979440)
.

Al-Zawahiri took over amid the “Arab Spring”. Tunisia’s autocrat had been put to flight and in Egypt the crowds had done what Al-Zawahiri had been trying to do for thirty years, bringing down Al-Sadat’s dutiful successor, Hosni Mubarak, who was [once described](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/1995-09-01/sorrows-egypt)
 as “a civil servant with the rank of president”. Yemen’s long-time ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh had [nearly](https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-57481820110603)
 been shelled out of office and Libya was in full-scale rebellion against Colonel Muamar al-Qaddafi, which NATO had [stepped in to assist](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/10/21/why-nato-was-right-to-intervene-in-libya/)
. Al-Zawahiri’s [first released speech](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/07/28/al.qaeda.leader.message/index.html)
 as leader, however, in late July 2011, focused Syria, at that time four months into a generally peaceful uprising that had been met with pitiless brutality by Bashar al-Asad’s regime, assisted by Iran. Al-Zawahiri encouraged Syrians to adopt the way of jihad and not to look to the U.S. for support. It was to be events in Syria that more than any other shaped Al-Zawahiri’s tenure as Al-Qaeda’s emir.

Some [took the view](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704436004576299110143040714)
 that “the Arab Spring has simply overwhelmed the world of the jihadists.” Unfortunately, this was not so. The breakdown of States and the outbreak of civil wars allowed Al-Qaeda space and opportunities to expand. Bin Laden had been [musing on renaming](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/bin-laden-documents-alqaida-struggle)
 Al-Qaeda before his death, and in the post-Arab Spring phase the group half-heartedly did this, using the name “Ansar al-Shari’a” in many places. In Yemen, AQAP [made three attempts](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/)
 to create local emirates: shorter-lived efforts in 2011 and 2013, and—after the [coup by the IRGC’s Huthis and their rapid jihad](https://eeradicalization.com/becoming-ansar-allah-islamic-revolution-yemen-oved-lobel/)
 conquered vast swathes of the country—a more successful effort for a year in 2015-16 in Mukalla that ended effectively in withdrawal, rather than defeat. Al-Qaeda embedded in Libya after Qaddafi, notoriously murdering the U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi in September 2012, and was concurrently occupying northern Mali, from which it was removed by French intervention in early 2013. In Somalia, Al-Shabab’s fortunes have waxed and waned, but the group remains powerful in the southern and rural zones, while intermittently challenging the nominal State in its one area of serious control, the capital Mogadishu. These statelet projects in the first half of 2010s built to some extent on what had happened in Iraq a decade earlier, and in some places, notably Mali, repeated some of the same mistakes—failing, as AQIM’s then-emir [Abd al-Malek Drukdel](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/06/11/france-kill-drukdel-aqim/)
 (Abu Musab Abd al-Wadud) put it in [a letter to his theatre commander](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/en-jihadi-rivalry-2.pdf)
, to realise that the population was like a “baby … in its first days” that needed “support … until it stands”, not the application of shari’a with “extreme speed”, which will “engender hatred towards the mujahideen”.

Zarqawi’s Islamic State movement had been sponsored by Al-Qaeda since its creation in 1999, significantly driven by **Muhammad Saladin Zaydan (Sayf al-Adel)**, a then-senior Bin Laden deputy and Al-Qaeda’s military chief after Atef’s demise. Sayf’s thinking was conditioned in 1999 by intra-jihadist rivalries in Afghanistan. After 9/11, it was Sayf—by then based in Iran, where he still is—who led the effort to merge Al-Qaeda’s and Zarqawi’s strategic visions. Zarqawi, who received his own [direct assistance from the Iranians](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 ahead of his arrival in Saddam’s Baghdad in May 2002, never overtly broke his arrangement with Al-Qaeda before his death in June 2006. Indeed, Zarqawi finally gave _bay’a_ to Bin Laden in October 2004 and formally took on the Al-Qaeda name.

That said, even Zarqawi had cross-words with Al-Qaeda’s leadership—Al-Zawahiri wrote him a [famously reproving letter](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
 that was intercepted in 2005—and Zarqawi’s successors almost immediately moved relations into [a state of willed ambiguity](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
, where they remained for eight years, before the contest over jihadist visions for Syria led to a catastrophic rupture in 2014. The [crucial point is](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 that analysis goes wrong if it sees the Islamic State as an Al-Qaeda “offshoot”: what happened in 2014 was “not a schism in the sense of two entities emerging from common foundations; it was the inevitable unravelling of an attempt, made in contingent circumstances, to merge two distinct and incompatible strategic visions.”

I wrote [a lengthy report recently on Al-Qaeda’s strategic evolution](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
, which is heavily impacted by its interaction with the Islamic State, so I won’t reiterate all of that here. The only additional point to highlight is that if one has to pin down a fork in the road where the IS-Qaeda collaboration became untenable, it was not 2013-14 in Syria, but 2007-08 in Iraq: “Where Bin Laden had seen IS’s setback \[in the Surge and Awakening\] as evidence their strategy was defective, IS had [come to the reverse conclusion](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-islamic-states-strategic-plan)
: there had been tactical errors, especially with the tribes, but the essentials of their theological-strategic vision were correct, and with adjustments they could recover and prevail; \[with the declaration of the ‘caliphate’\] they had their proof. As IS saw it, having been left for dead in 2007-08, they were able to revive by keeping their ideology pure and then do what all other Islamists claim to want to do.” A similar ideological divergence has taken hold in assessing the destruction of the “caliphate” in 2019: Al-Qaeda believes to have tried and failed makes it more difficult to convince people to try again; IS says it shows it is possible.

Under Al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda’s separation from the Islamic State movement was made absolute, and there is now no way back. Al-Zawahiri, building off some of the last things Bin Laden was writing, even [leaned-in to some of the accusations](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
 the Zarqawists levelled at him, particularly about Al-Qaeda’s “populist” turn, its view that jihad cannot succeed without a mass audience. IS, of course, will have no part of holding the implementation of the Holy Law hostage to a plebiscite. The competition between Al-Qaeda and the Zarqawists has shaped the jihadist movement over the last decade, and will surely be important for some time to come, though the question remains of how long Al-Qaeda can remain in the competition.

**AL-ZAWAHIRI’S DOWNFALL AND AL-QAEDA NOW**


---------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri’s demise, six decades after he joined the jihad and a quarter-century after he became one of America’s most wanted men, was suitably dramatic—in itself and in its implications.

Just [after 6 AM](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62400923)
 that Sunday morning a year ago, having done his morning prayers, Al-Zawahiri stepped out onto the balcony of a villa in the Sherpur area of Kabul that had been [appropriated from](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home)
 one of the American aid workers forced to flee Afghanistan when President Biden [gave the country back](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/bidens-enduring-afghanistan-debacle)
 to Pakistan’s jihadists in August 2021. Al-Zawahiri was being watched by an American drone and moments later the Al-Qaeda leader was shredded by two Hellfire R9Xs, missiles that use rapidly rotating blades instead of explosives to minimise unintentional casualties.[54](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-54-135614300)
 Biden, in his [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/)
 announcing Al-Zawahiri’s killing, drew attention to the blood on Al-Zawahiri’s hands and quite rightly added: “justice has been delivered”.

The most immediate question was who would replace Al-Zawahiri and one year later we are still waiting for an answer to _that_ question. **Al-Qaeda has not formally announced Al-Zawahiri’s replacement**, and there are [several possibilities](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)
, though it is widely believed **Sayf al-Adel** has the role.[55](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-55-135614300)
 Sayf would continue the localisation of Al-Qaeda and its aversion to direct terrorism in the West, having never wanted to go down that path in the first place (Sayf was [among the internal opponents](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 of the 9/11 attacks). But Sayf might well try to step up regional terrorism, or at least might well find himself being directed to escalate on that front. When Sayf began his present stay in Iran in 2002, as a guest of the thankfully-late [Qassem Sulaymani](https://eeradicalization.com/the-middle-east-after-qassem-sulaymani/)
, his relationship with the clerical regime and its spy-terrorist commander was already old.[56](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-56-135614300)
 Sayf had, for example, been one the Al-Qaeda jihadists [on the Iranian training program](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/u-s-district-court-ruling-2011-11-28-iran-hizballah-involvement-in-1998-embassy-attacks.pdf)
 that enabled the East Africa Embassy bombings in 1998, and it was Sayf, while in Iran, who [relayed the orders](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10576100802291568)
—from Al-Zawahiri, notably—to begin the terrorist campaign in Saudi Arabia in the early 2000s. At this stage there is no doubt that Sayf is a creature of the IRGC; there have been chances to leave, [taken by some of Sayf’s comrades](https://twitter.com/KyleWOrton/status/1566036131275227137)
, but he never has. Iran has exerted [considerable influence](https://eeradicalization.com/death-and-consequences-for-al-qaedas-leadership/)
 over Al-Qaeda for decades and Sayf’s ascension would be the culmination of that. Which would be Sayf’s primary problem: Al-Qaeda’s operatives and sympathisers have gotten used to rationalising the relationship with Iran;[57](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-57-135614300)
 having the Iranians so overtly running the show is a different matter.[58](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-58-135614300)
 The operational benefits of having a terrorist regime behind Sayf are obvious, but the political consequences [within the jihadist world](https://anbajassim.com/2022/08/30/%d8%aa%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b5%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6%d8%a9-%d9%84%d8%aa%d9%88%d9%84%d9%8a-%d8%b3%d9%8a%d9%81-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%af/)
 are negative, whether it is morale within Al-Qaeda or the group’s ability to compete with the Islamic State for the “undecideds”.

It is an open question how much impact Sayf or anyone else as emir _can_ have on Al-Qaeda’s fortunes, even if he brings further Iranian support to the role. Al-Zawahiri was a notoriously awful, charisma-less speaker, which certainly matters when Al-Qaeda’s leader is significantly involved in setting strategic direction and tone.[59](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-59-135614300)
 Some argue this visible failure has obscured [Al-Zawahiri’s quieter successes](https://www.jihadica.com/zawahiri-is-not-the-loser-people-think-he-is/)
, notably keeping the organisation cohesive after the Islamic State challenge. There is likely something to this,[60](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-60-135614300)
 even if Al-Zawahiri was not the [effective micromanager Bin Laden was](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/books/review/the-rise-and-fall-of-osama-bin-laden-peter-bergen.html)
 right down to the end. While it is not clear whether Sayf would be better at the propaganda side of the work, he does seem to be skilled in bureaucracy and strategy. The problem is, Sayf is inheriting an organisation that is struggling on most metrics and in ways that will not easily be patched up. The decentralisation, for example, has weakened the Centre’s influence, but has not compartmentalised the theatres very well from the contagion of failure: [whatever is going on in Syria](https://eeradicalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EER-Report-Al-Qaeda-and-Global-Terrorism-Kyle-Orton.pdf#page=21)
, the jihadists are restricted to a besieged corner of the country; things are not good in Yemen; the competition with the Islamic State in Africa grinds on. Still, Afghanistan could yet revive the group’s fortunes; paradoxically, Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul is a serious sign of life for Al-Qaeda.

Probably the most important implication of Al-Zawahiri being killed in the Taliban’s capital is that it [eliminates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taliban-ties-with-al-qaeda-endure-as-terrorist-leader-killed-by-u-s-in-afghan-capital-11659482149)
 all the silly arguments about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda being separable. Where one goes, the other follows, because they are not, in fact, meaningfully distinct organisations but a part of a single jihadist network, sharing an ideology, resources, and ultimately a command structure that runs through Aabpara.[61](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-61-135614300)
 To crystalise this point, Al-Zawahiri was in a house [owned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62393618)
 and [protected](https://twitter.com/FrudBezhan/status/1554432905899909121)
 by Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is the “interior minister” of the Taliban’s emirate and the declared overall deputy of the Taliban. Sirajuddin is also a [senior Al-Qaeda member](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
,[62](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-62-135614300)
 and the well-trained unit within the Taliban that Siraj directly oversees, the “Haqqani Network”, is [particularly](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-15026909)
 [close](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/world/asia/mullen-asserts-pakistani-role-in-attack-on-us-embassy.html)
 to [the ISI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-cia-attack-idUSKCN0XB2VM)
, which means Pakistan’s military-intelligence establishment knew where Al-Qaeda’s leader was and tried to shield him from America—_again_.[63](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-63-135614300)

It is in part to avoid these implications for the Taliban/Pakistan that no admission has been put out under Al-Qaeda’s name that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. Hours after the strike, the [Taliban condemned it](https://jihadology.net/2022/08/01/new-statement-from-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistans-dhabi%e1%b8%a5-allah-mujahid-regarding-the-drone-attack-in-kabul-city/)
, hilariously as a violation of the “Doha Agreement”. The Doha “deal” did not have many concrete terms—its main purpose was to cover the U.S. withdrawal—but in so many words it frowned on harbouring Al-Qaeda’s emir. Anyway, [reporting from earlier this year](https://www.thedailybeast.com/al-qaeda-is-planning-to-fake-the-death-of-ayman-al-zawahiri-its-dead-leader)
 indicated that the Taliban wanted to get out of this awkward situation by muzzling Al-Qaeda—the attempt to hold a public funeral was apparently shut down—and then announcing at some point that Al-Zawahiri has died of natural causes, definitely not in Afghanistan. To this hour, the Taliban are [issuing direct denials](https://www.voanews.com/a/7193513.html)
 that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. It is difficult to believe anybody is actually fooled by this, but it is possible the U.S. and others in Europe will go along with this for political reasons, both to save their own face about what they have already done and to pave the way for the “engagement” with the Taliban that some of them think is necessary.

Biden’s supporters and the [usual suspects](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/08/01/al-zawahiri-killing-shows-over-the-horizon-counterterrorism-can-work/)
 tried to make political hay out of Al-Zawahiri’s killing, claiming it as a victory for the “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism “strategy”. Doubtless this narrative had some traction. Cynics might wonder if the timing of this strike—given that Al-Zawahiri was [tracked down](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-02/joe-biden-to-speak-al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri/101290492)
 six [months earlier](https://twitter.com/abdsayedd/status/1554386396516732930)
—was not meant to dampen the criticism on the first anniversary of Biden abandoning Afghanistan. If so, it pretty much worked. The success on the political front, however, does not erase the analytical questions from those of us who regard this [“over-the-rainbow” concept](https://www.axios.com/2021/09/12/afghanistan-counterterrorism-over-horizon-biden)
 askance. The full weight of the American Imperium being able to find and neutralise one long-time nemesis [does not even begin to suggest](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/can-the-west-keep-track-of-the-threat)
 that the U.S. has good visibility into the dynamics within Afghanistan that are fostering emerging threats. All we know for now is that the jihadist movement and Islamists more broadly have been buoyed by the fall of Afghanistan, and that Al-Qaeda is in places Biden said it would not be.[64](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-64-135614300)

Bin Laden had been moved to create the Masada camp after the humiliating fiasco at Zhawar in April 1986, which disclosed how badly organised and incapable the Arab-Afghan fighters were. In April 1987, the Arab-Afghans endured what might most accurately be described as a less-bad defeat at the battle at Jaji: the Mujahideen (just about) held off one of the Soviet “retreating offensive” incursions, but the Arabs got mauled and forced to retreat. Still, it wasn’t quite the decimation of a year earlier, and Bin Laden—who personally fought at Jaji—ascribed the improvement, naturally, to the training at Masada. In casting the Arabs at Jaji as partaking in glorious victory, Bin Laden was helped by the daily dispatches of Jamal Khashoggi, and Bin Laden’s star was born in the Arab world. It was this moment in the spring of 1987 that Mustafa Hamid identifies as “the main cause of Al-Qaeda’s emergence as a separate organisation, and its rapid growth.” Hamid adds that Bin Laden’s money also played a significant role, since most other factions were broke by this point. See: Mustafa Hamid and Leah Farrall (2015), _The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, p. 111.

The Egyptians closest to Bin Laden seem to have been: [Ali Amin al-Rashidi](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/al-qaedas-first-military-emir/)
 (Abu Ubayda al-Panjshiri), [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and Sayyed Imam al-Sharif (Dr. Fadl)—rather than Al-Zawahiri. Al-Sharif was close to Al-Zawahiri, though neither of them were major figures in the Arab-Afghan population. The narrative that “evil Egyptians” led Bin Laden astray in the late 1980s might have partly originated in a post-9/11 effort by Azzam’s partisans and/or the Saudi government to rewrite the history to make themselves look better. The main aspect, however, seems to be some Western authors and journalists having “overdramatized the intrigues in Peshawar”, where there really was “bad blood between Abdallah Azzam and some of the Egyptians”. _The Caravan_, pp. 359-61.

[16](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-16-135614300)

Azzam, though not a member of Al-Qaeda, was “not a very active opponent”: he largely did not understand what it was and where it was going, but his tendency to avoid intra-Muslim conflict meant Azzam generally did not oppose developments within the Arab-Afghan population, and was not displeased at the special forces-like capacity Al-Qaeda was providing to the Arab-Afghans \[_The Caravan_, p. 361\]. Minutes from a meeting in August 1988 are sometimes held up as the founding of Al-Qaeda. What those minutes actually show is Al-Qaeda as a pre-existing organisation, and an effort to poach from Azzam’s cadre—albeit subtly, since one of Azzam’s key lieutenants, Tamim al-Adnani, was present \[_The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, pp. 108-12\]. In other words, Bin Laden was competing with Azzam, even if Azzam was not aware of it.

The exact timeline of Bin Laden’s arrival in Sudan is somewhat contested. The 9/11 Commission Report simply says: “Bin Ladin moved to Sudan in 1991”. Other sources than the link cited above give the arrival date as December 1991, for example, _A History of Modern Sudan_ (2008), by Robert Collins (p. 196), which describes Bin Laden being received “enthusiastically” by Al-Turabi. There are claims for other dates, both later (January 1992 seems to be quite a common one) and earlier—Dwight Hamilton and Kostas Rimsa claim (p. 94) in, _Terror Threat: International and Homegrown Terrorists and Their Threat to Canada_ (2007), that Bin Laden was “fully established” in Sudan by mid-September 1991—but the sourcing for these is less credible.

 of his interrogation that we know how early he established Al-Qaeda’s relations with the Huthis—but he was released _very_ quickly. This kind of catch-and-release, as well as the mysterious jailbreaks, were a feature of the Saleh government’s “War on Terror” policy.

 Al-Banna was behind the confusion over Al-Badawi’s real identity, convincing Al-Badawi to adopt the _kunya_ “Abu Ayyub al-Masri”. By all accounts, Al-Banna and Al-Badawi were close socially as well as ideologically and organisationally, having [run Al-Qaeda’s operations together](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 for two years, from 1996 to 1998, and Al-Banna’s devotion to Al-Zawahiri appears absolute. Al-Banna (and Al-Badawi) were appointed leaders in Yemen [by Al-Zawahiri](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 in the 1990s, and in 2006 Al-Banna unhesitatingly stepped down as emir from what was not-yet called AQAP to make way for Nasir al-Wuhayshi after he had been freed in one of those Yemeni jailbreaks. Al-Banna [worked in Yemen](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 with Muhammad al-Zawahiri, brother of the departed Al-Qaeda emir, and [Ahmad Mabruk](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/10/04/al-qaeda-in-syria-and-american-policy/)
, also an EIJ veteran, who accompanied the good doctor on the 1995 Russia trip and was a major jihadist figure in his own right. [Another of AQAP’s accounts](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/an-al-qaeda-commander-comes-out-from-the-shadows.php)
 tells of Al-Banna having been imprisoned in the late 1980s with another EIJ operative, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid (Saeed al-Masri), who had served time earlier in the 1980s, presumably simultaneous with if not alongside Al-Zawahiri, as part of the post-Sadat crackdown. Al-Yazid was Al-Qaeda’s financial emir at the time of 9/11 and rose to be number three in the organisation by about 2007, [appointed](https://www.bbc.com/news/10206180)
 to oversee the war in Afghanistan and as Bin Laden’s chief of staff. Al-Yazid was [killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/asia/01qaeda.html)
 in a drone strike in May 2010 and replaced by a Libyan, Jamal al-Misrati (Atiyya). Al-Yazid had been one of the point-men handling AQC’s relations with the IS movement. Al-Yazid [instructed Samir Hijazi](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/14/al-qaeda-central-in-syria/)

The 9/11 Commission Report (p. 532) notes that KSM claimed Al-Zawahiri was opposed to the 9/11 attacks, imploring Bin Laden to adhere to Taliban emir Mullah Muhammad Umar’s injunction after the Embassy bombings against using Afghanistan as a base to attack the U.S., but “other detainees” said Al-Zawahiri was “squarely behind” Bin Laden, which seems to be the truth. It is possible KSM was trying to exclude other jihadists from “credit” for the “Planes Operation”.

The first use of the “ninja missile” was in Syria, in February 2017, to kill Al-Zawahiri’s then-deputy, [Abu al-Khayr](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/02/27/al-qaedas-deputy-killed-in-syria/)
. At the time, those of us watching Syria knew that something was different about the strike—Abu al-Khayr’s car was still intact, except for a section of roof on one side—and then it happened several more times. It [took two years](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secret-u-s-missile-aims-to-kill-only-terrorists-not-nearby-civilians-11557403411)

That said, Ansaru—the Al-Qaeda faction in Nigeria—did go out of its way to [issue a statement](https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-propaganda-renews-focus-on-africa-but-a-jihadist-monopoly-remains-elusive/)
 defending Sayf, specifically from the charges of being an Iranian puppet, about three weeks before Al-Zawahiri was killed.

[58](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-58-135614300)

The other most obvious candidate after Sayf is **Muhammad Abbatay (Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi)**, Al-Zawahiri’s son-in-law, who is also in Iran. **Yasin al-Suri**, another serious contended, is in Iran, too.

Gregg Carlstrom, the Middle East correspondent at _The_ _Economist_, [memorably tweeted](https://twitter.com/glcarlstrom/status/1554219194127990788)
: “Zawahiri will be best remembered for transforming al-Qaeda from a feared terrorist franchise into a really boring podcast”.

A U.S. National Security Council official [said on background](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/01/background-press-call-by-a-senior-administration-official-on-a-u-s-counterterrorism-operation/)
: “\[Al-Zawahiri\] used his authority across Al-Qaeda’s global network of regional affiliates and followers to provide strategic direction and continually urging attacks on the United States and reinforcing the prioritization of the United States as Al-Qaeda’s primary enemy. … He built an organizational model that allowed him to lead the global network, even from relative isolation. And he was one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of \[status\] significance”.

On 29 July 2022, Siraj gave an [interview to an Indian outlet](https://www.news18.com/news/world/exclusive-afghanistan-needs-indias-help-desperately-to-secure-peaceful-environment-taliban-interior-minister-haqqani-5670295.html)
 saying: “Al-Qaeda … has no presence in Afghanistan and is no more of a threat and the world should not feel threatened about the already dead outfit.” It’s obviously amusing enough given Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul two days later, and more so once it is understood that Siraj is also a member of Al-Qaeda and was speaking from Afghanistan.

Carlotta Gall’s _The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014_ goes as far as one can on the present evidence in describing Pakistan’s concealment of Bin Laden up to 2011. Whether ever detail transpires to be true on that specific issue, it is an excellent description of the shameful situation the West got into in Afghanistan, paying Pakistan to pretend to help us, as it barely concealed the fact it orchestrated the jihadist mayhem that killed our soldiers and thousands of Afghan civilians. In terms of last year, the White House spokesman was asked whether Pakistan had been warned about the drone heading for Al-Zawahiri, and [pointedly responded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/02/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-august-2-2022/)
, “There were no notifications in advance”. Any such notification to Pakistan would have led to Al-Qaeda’s leader being tipped off.

[64](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-anchor-64-135614300)

Biden made a [strange statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/30/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-administrations-student-debt-relief-program/)
 (even stranger if you see the video) on 30 June: “Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al-Qaeda would not be there. I said it wouldn’t be there. I said we’d get help from the Taliban. What’s happening now? What’s going on? Read your press. I was right.” The “help from the Taliban” line was particularly odd, since Biden had needed to order the strike on Al-Zawahiri precisely because the Taliban were _not_ helping against Al-Qaeda, and were in fact harbouring its leader in their capital. In the year since, the evidence has piled up all in the same direction. The U.N. Monitoring Team report in June painted an alarming picture of what the ISI network is doing in Afghanistan—and makes clear that it is all components of that network: “The link between the Taliban and both Al-Qaida and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) \[the ‘Pakistani Taliban’\] remains strong and symbiotic. A range of terrorist groups have greater freedom of manoeuvre under the Taliban … They are making good use of this, and the threat of terrorism is rising in both Afghanistan and the region”. Etc. Etc. A decent summary of the report is [available here](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/un-warns-of-risk-of-terrorism-from-afghanistan/)

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm that Donald Trump was active in July 2024 and had interactions with Israeli leaders, there is no evidence of the specific post mentioned in the claim. The search results focus on meetings and addresses, not on the alleged Truth Social post.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles about an attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13, 2024. CNN published an article on July 14, 2024, with a statement from the Trump campaign regarding the incident, and Axios also published an article on July 14, 2024, about the same event. <image:7670>, <image:7671>


## Elaboration
Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, and Trump's activity on Truth Social, there is no evidence of a post on July 25, 2024, with the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel."

NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-engages-truth-social-diplomacy-iran-crisis-rcna214719](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-engages-truth-social-diplomacy-iran-crisis-rcna214719)) includes an image <image:7643> of a Truth Social post by Donald J. Trump, stating "THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!". The post was made 11 hours prior to the search.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/25/12-posts-from-12-day-war-how-trump-live-posted-israel-iran-conflict](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/25/12-posts-from-12-day-war-how-trump-live-posted-israel-iran-conflict)) published an article about Donald Trump's posts on Truth Social during a conflict between Iran and Israel, including posts from June 13 and June 15, 2025. <image:7644> The Atlantic ([https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/israel-iran-trump-truth-social/683306/](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/israel-iran-trump-truth-social/683306/)) provides an image <image:7645> of a Truth Social post from Donald J. Trump, stating "ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran...". The post was made 4 hours prior to the publication of the article.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump uses Truth Social. The search results include articles about his activity on the platform, including posts related to international conflicts. However, there is no evidence in the provided documents to verify the specific claim about Trump's post on July 25, 2024, regarding Israel. The provided evidence includes posts from 2025, but not from the date mentioned in the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a specific post from Donald Trump on Truth Social dated July 25, 2024, and containing the exact quote provided in the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is likely from the Middle East, with a high probability of being in Jordan or Palestine. The image search results confirm that there has been significant destruction in Gaza, with multiple news outlets publishing images of destroyed buildings. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date of the image.

The claim states the image was taken in December 2024. The Guardian article was published on January 18, 2025, and the NPR article was published on October 9, 2024. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

reverse_search(<image:33>)
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with images of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:7678>). NPR also contains an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (<image:7681>). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (<image:7682>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/a-visual-guide-to-the-destruction-of-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/a-visual-guide-to-the-destruction-of-gaza), [https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map), and [https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely from the Middle East, with a high probability of being in Jordan or Palestine. The image search results confirm that there has been significant destruction in Gaza, with multiple news outlets publishing images of destroyed buildings. However, the evidence does not confirm the exact date of the image.

The claim states the image was taken in December 2024. The Guardian article was published on January 18, 2025, and the NPR article was published on October 9, 2024. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely from Gaza, and the evidence confirms significant destruction in the area. The claim's date of December 2024 is plausible, as the provided sources show destruction in Gaza around that time.

`true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image likely depicts destruction in Gaza, as confirmed by image search results and geolocation data, with the date of December 2024 being plausible based on the publication dates of related news articles ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/a-visual-guide-to-the-destruction-of-gaza), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza)).

In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
===================================================================

!In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand. <image:2101>

15.12.2024 20:50

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

### ABANDONED TANK BECAME A FRUIT STAND

On the other hand, an abandoned tank by regime forces became a fruit stand. The image showed various fruits and vegetables being sold on the tank's surface.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.haberler.com/in-syria-an-abandoned-tank-has-become-a-fruit-and-2027395/): Found exact image on website with title: In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.
Content: The search result is from a Turkish news website and contains an image of a tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand. The article states that the image was taken in Syria. The article is dated December 15, 2024. <image:2101>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an image of Merkava tanks (<image:7282>). The Associated Press published an image of a market in Gaza (<image:7283>). A video shows a Syrian market vendor selling fruits and vegetables from an abandoned tank (<image:7285>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza with a Merkava tank is inaccurate. The reverse image search indicates that the image is from Syria, not Gaza. The tank in the image is not identified as a Merkava tank, and the evidence suggests it is an abandoned tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand in Syria.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented.

Some on X are calling it the ‘Israeli Motorola massacre,’ blaming Motorola for manufacturing the deadly Hezbollah pagers that exploded in Lebanon. For years, the American mobile company has faced boycotts, accused of supplying the Israeli army with communication and bomb equipment devices. We tell you more in this edition of Truth or Fake.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

An analysis by Truemedia, a tool that detects digitally manipulated images, indicates that the image is most likely AI-generated.Image: Screenshot truemedia.org

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

I løpet av det siste året har volumet av manipulert informasjon fra Midtøsten blitt stadig større. Her kan du se hvordan de prøver å lure deg.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida. Flere israelske kilder deler også dette bildet som dokumentasjon på skader etter personsøkerangrepet.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that there was an attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase or that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah.

The image search results do not provide any information about the authenticity of the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm the location of the airbase in the image and the details of the attack.

### Evidence from `image_search`

Content: Al Jazeera published a timeline of Israel's attacks on Gaza since 2005. The timeline includes military assaults in 2008-9, 2012, 2014, and 2021. <image:7789>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joan Laporta met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, but the exact date is not specified. However, a Marca article featuring Joan Laporta was published on July 18, 2021. Additionally, a timeline from Al Jazeera shows military assaults on Gaza in 2021.

The claim states the meeting occurred in September 2024, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests the meeting happened before September 2024. The claim also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, which is partially supported by the timeline of attacks.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the meeting date is incorrect.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

!Félix Maradiaga <image:4682>

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

!Gulbahar Haitiwaji <image:4684>

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

!Sana Seif, on June 14 in Oslo. Behind her, an image of a demonstration in which she demanded the freedom of her brother Alaa. <image:4688>

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

!Abdulrahman Almawwas <image:4699>

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

The evidence includes a map of the Israel-Hamas war as of January 15, 2024, and an image from 12newsnow.com asking "IS THE DRAFT COMING BACK?". However, the provided links do not explicitly confirm the reinstitution of the draft. One of the links is a fact-check article that denies the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm whether the US reinstituted the draft.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes a map of the Israel-Hamas war as of January 15, 2024, and an image from 12newsnow.com asking "IS THE DRAFT COMING BACK?". However, the provided links do not explicitly confirm the reinstitution of the draft. One of the links is a fact-check article that denies the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. More information is needed to confirm whether the US reinstituted the draft.
