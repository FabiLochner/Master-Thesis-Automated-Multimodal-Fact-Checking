## Actions
```
image_search("Bono Bob Geldof Israeli Embassy Dublin")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Journal.ie published an article about an AI-generated photo of Bono and Bob Geldof with Israeli flags (![image 7517](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504549-106832.jpg)). ABP Live states that the image is fake (![image 7518](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504549-276717.jpg)). Another source contains an image of Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags (![image 7519](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504549-542866.jpg)).

The image in the claim (![image 22](media/31.jpg)) is of Bono and Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image in the claim is fake. The Journal.ie published an article about an AI-generated photo of Bono and Bob Geldof with Israeli flags. ABP Live also states that the image is fake.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is not authentic. Multiple sources confirm that the image is AI-generated or fake.
