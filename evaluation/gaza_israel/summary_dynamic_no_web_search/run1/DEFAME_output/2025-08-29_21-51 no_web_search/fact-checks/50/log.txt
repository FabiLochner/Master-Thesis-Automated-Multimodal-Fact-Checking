The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel is not supported by the evidence. While DNA tests are discussed in the context of Israeli law, particularly regarding immigration and establishing Jewish identity, none of the provided sources explicitly state that it is illegal to conduct a DNA test in Israel. The sources, including those from the Israel Democracy Institute ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)), the Law Office in Israel ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)), and Blaer Law ([Source](https://blaerlaw.com/en/judaism-israel-and-dna-or-how-to-obtain-israeli-citizenship-if-documents-are-not-in-order/)), focus on the use of DNA tests within legal frameworks, not their illegality.

So, the overall veracity is: false
