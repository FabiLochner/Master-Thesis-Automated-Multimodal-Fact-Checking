The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence, including images from the BBC News and Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd172rp02e0o), [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/7/14/the-trump-assassination-attempt-a-race-reset-and-more-polarisation)), and articles discussing potential conflicts between Israel and Iran, does not support the claim. There is no information about an assassination plot against Donald Trump or any Jewish Americans orchestrating it. The evidence also does not support the claim that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran.

So, the overall veracity is: false
