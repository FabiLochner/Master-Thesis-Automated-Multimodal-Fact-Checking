The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: The image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that says "FUCK ISRAEL" is authentic, as evidenced by its appearance in articles from The Ecologist ([https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza](https://theecologist.org/2023/nov/03/greta-stands-gaza)) and The Telegraph ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)). However, the claim that the image is from November 2024 is inaccurate, as the image was published in November 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
