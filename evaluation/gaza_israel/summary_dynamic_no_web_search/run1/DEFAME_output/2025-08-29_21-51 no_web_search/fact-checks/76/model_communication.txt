# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

Claim: "<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:48>)
image_search("Ramat David airbase attack September 22 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:48>

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats published a map showing attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024. <image:2186> The map shows that Lebanese Hezbollah conducted a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there was an attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase or that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah.

The image search results do not provide any information about the authenticity of the image.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. Additional information is needed to confirm the location of the airbase in the image and the details of the attack.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that there was an attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase or that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah.

The claim is not factually accurate because there is not enough evidence to verify the claim. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

While there was an attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats ([Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024)), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase or that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Joan Laporta met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, but the exact date is not specified. However, a Marca article featuring Joan Laporta was published on July 18, 2021. Additionally, a timeline from Al Jazeera shows military assaults on Gaza in 2021.

The claim states the meeting occurred in September 2024, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests the meeting happened before September 2024. The claim also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, which is partially supported by the timeline of attacks.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the meeting date is incorrect.

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/7/timeline-israels-attacks-on-gaza-since-2005): 
Content: Al Jazeera published a timeline of Israel's attacks on Gaza since 2005. The timeline includes military assaults in 2008-9, 2012, 2014, and 2021. <image:7789>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Joan Laporta met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, but the exact date is not specified. However, a Marca article featuring Joan Laporta was published on July 18, 2021. Additionally, a timeline from Al Jazeera shows military assaults on Gaza in 2021.

The claim states the meeting occurred in September 2024, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests the meeting happened before September 2024. The claim also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, which is partially supported by the timeline of attacks.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the meeting date is incorrect.


## Final Judgement
The image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives. The meeting occurred before September 2024, and the Gaza war was ongoing at the time. The claim is false because the meeting date is incorrect. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives. While the meeting did occur, it happened before September 2024, and the Gaza war was ongoing at the time, making the claim's specified date inaccurate.

[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

**Family “didn’t know”**
------------------------

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

!Félix Maradiaga <image:4682>

Nicaraguan opponent Félix Maradiaga, during his speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum on June 13.

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
