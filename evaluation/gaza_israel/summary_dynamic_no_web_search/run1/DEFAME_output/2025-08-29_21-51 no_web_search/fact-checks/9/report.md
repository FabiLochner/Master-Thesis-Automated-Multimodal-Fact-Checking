## Claim
Claim: "![image 9](media/9.jpg) This image shows an Israeli missile attack on Iran in the early hours of October 26, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 9](media/9.jpg))
image_search("Israeli missile attack Iran October 26 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 9](media/9.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran (![image 6927](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501849-721809.jpg)). CNN published an article about Israeli strikes in Iran (![image 6928](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-121773.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article about Israeli attacks on Iran on October 26, 2024 (![image 6929](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-652723.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran. Al Jazeera also published an article about the attacks on the same date. However, the evidence does not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, it is impossible to verify the claim based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm if the image depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran on October 26, 2024.


## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 9](media/9.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'China': 0.42, 'Malaysia': 0.32, 'Taiwan': 0.13, 'Singapore': 0.03, 'Australia': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Japan': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The geolocation of the image suggests that it was most likely taken in China or Malaysia. This contradicts the claim that the image depicts an event in Iran.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that there were Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024. However, the geolocation of the image suggests that it was most likely taken in China or Malaysia, contradicting the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there were indeed Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, as reported by sources like the [Institute for the Study of War](![image 6927](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501849-721809.jpg)) and [Al Jazeera](![image 6929](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-652723.jpg)), the image in question was likely taken in China or Malaysia, according to geolocation analysis.
