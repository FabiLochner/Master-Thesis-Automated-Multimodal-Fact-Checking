image_search("earthquake damage Myanmar 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 2](media/1.jpg)

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Britannica website ([https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025)) shows an image of the aftermath of the Myanmar earthquake of 2025. ![image 7435](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504344-805875.jpg) The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html)) published an article on March 28, 2025, about an earthquake in Myanmar. ![image 7436](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504345-405772.jpg)

The search result from [https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/building-damage-assessment-march-2025-myanmar-earthquake](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/building-damage-assessment-march-2025-myanmar-earthquake) contains an image of an excavator working in the rubble. ![image 7437](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504346-030354.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an earthquake occurred in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. The New York Times published an article on the same day about the event. The image search results show different images of the aftermath of the earthquake. However, none of the images match the one in the claim.

The claim's image is not directly confirmed by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the image's authenticity.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an earthquake occurred in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. However, the image in the claim is not directly confirmed by the evidence.

Since the image in the claim is not confirmed by the evidence, the claim is considered not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not entirely accurate. While an earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as confirmed by sources like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html) and [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/event/Myanmar-earthquake-of-2025), the provided image is not directly confirmed by the search results.
