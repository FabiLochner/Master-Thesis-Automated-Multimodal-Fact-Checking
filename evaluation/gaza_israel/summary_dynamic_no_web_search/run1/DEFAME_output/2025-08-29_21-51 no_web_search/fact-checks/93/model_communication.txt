JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
image_search("Houthis attack Israel July 19 2024")
```

## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there was a Houthi attack in Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack.

The claim is therefore unverified.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

SummarizeDocPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:60>)
image_search("airport crowd israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of a crowd at an Israeli airport (<image:7820>). NBC News also contains an image of a crowd in Israel (<image:7821>). The Australian Jewish News does not contain any relevant information.

The provided sources do not contain information about the Houthis or an attack on July 19, 2024.


## Elaboration
The image was most likely taken in Israel. However, the provided evidence does not support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. The image search results do not mention any attacks or the Houthis.

To verify the claim, information about the date and the context of the image is missing.


## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
image_search("Houthis attack Israel July 19 2024")
```
