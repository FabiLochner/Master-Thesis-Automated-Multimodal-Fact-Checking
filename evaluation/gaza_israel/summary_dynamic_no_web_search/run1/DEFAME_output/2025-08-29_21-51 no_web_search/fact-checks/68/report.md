### Evidence from `image_search`
The Los Angeles Times published an article on July 16, 2025, about unrest in Sweida, Syria, which includes an image of an explosion (![image 7270](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502436-403169.jpg)). Al Jazeera reports that Israel bombed military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025 (![image 7271](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502436-642050.jpg)). The search result from twz.com contains an image of an explosion (![image 7272](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502436-814160.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israel did bomb military targets in southern Syria outside Damascus in February 2025. The image in the claim was found in an article from Alghad News, published on December 2, 2023, reporting on an Israeli air attack on Damascus. Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image shows the destruction of the last remaining army depots.



## Final Judgement
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Israeli bombings in the area and time frame mentioned, the image's origin is earlier than the claimed event, and the evidence does not confirm the destruction of the last remaining army depots.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported. While there is evidence of Israeli bombings in the area and time frame mentioned, the image's origin is earlier than the claimed event, and the evidence does not confirm the destruction of the last remaining army depots. The image was found in an article from Alghad News, published on December 2, 2023, reporting on an Israeli air attack on Damascus ([https://www.alghad.tv/](https://www.alghad.tv/)).
