## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump uses Truth Social. The search results include articles about his activity on the platform, including posts related to international conflicts. However, there is no evidence in the provided documents to verify the specific claim about Trump's post on July 25, 2024, regarding Israel. The provided evidence includes posts from 2025, but not from the date mentioned in the claim.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a specific post from Donald Trump on Truth Social dated July 25, 2024, and containing the exact quote provided in the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm that Donald Trump was active in July 2024 and had interactions with Israeli leaders, there is no evidence of the specific post mentioned in the claim. The search results focus on meetings and addresses, not on the alleged Truth Social post.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles about an attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13, 2024.

## Elaboration
Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, and Trump's activity on Truth Social, there is no evidence of a post on July 25, 2024, with the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel."


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there is evidence of Trump's Truth Social activity and an attempted assassination, there is no evidence of the specific post with the quoted statement. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, stating "I hope that America obliterates Israel" cannot be verified. While evidence confirms Trump's use of Truth Social and an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, no evidence supports the specific post with the quoted statement.
