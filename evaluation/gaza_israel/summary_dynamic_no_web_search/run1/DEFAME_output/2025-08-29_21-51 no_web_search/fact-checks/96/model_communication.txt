### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://gigaza.org/en/massacres/page/86/?e-page-00fab05=3): 
Content: The search result from gigaza.org contains an image of a destroyed building and people in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. <image:7832>


## Elaboration
The image search result from gigaza.org shows a destroyed building and people in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. This provides context to the location mentioned in the claim. However, the evidence still does not confirm the claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel.

The evidence does not provide information about the circumstances of their deaths or the involvement of Israel.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as reports from reliable sources confirming the deaths of Mayar and Bilal Hamida, the cause of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.
