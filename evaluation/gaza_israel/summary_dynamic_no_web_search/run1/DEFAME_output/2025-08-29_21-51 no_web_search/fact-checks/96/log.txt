The claim '<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence does not confirm the claim that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel. While image searches provide context to the location mentioned in the claim, they lack information about the circumstances of their deaths or Israel's involvement. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of supporting evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
