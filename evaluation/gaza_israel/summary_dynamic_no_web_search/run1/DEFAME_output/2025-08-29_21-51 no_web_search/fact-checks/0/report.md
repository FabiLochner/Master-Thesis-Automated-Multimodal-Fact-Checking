## Elaboration
The image in the claim is of two soldiers from the 19th Special Forces Group in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, according to the reverse image search result from Wikimedia Commons ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg)). The image is not of General John Pagri.

The claim also states that the image is from April 2025, but the image is from 2007. The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is of two soldiers from the 19th Special Forces Group in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, not General John Pagri. The claim also states that the image is from April 2025, but the image is from 2007.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is misrepresented and the context is incorrect. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of two soldiers from the 19th Special Forces Group in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, as confirmed by a reverse image search on Wikimedia Commons ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg)). The claim misidentifies the individuals in the image and provides an incorrect date.
