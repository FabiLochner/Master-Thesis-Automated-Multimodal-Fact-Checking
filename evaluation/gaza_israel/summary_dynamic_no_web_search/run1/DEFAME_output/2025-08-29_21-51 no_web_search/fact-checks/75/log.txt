Useful result: From [Source](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/israeli-strike-hospital-tent-00183579): 
Content: Politico published an article on October 14, 2024, about an Israeli strike. The article contains an image of a fire. <image:7757>

The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image depicts a fire, there is no evidence to confirm that it is related to the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search found other images of fires related to the conflict, but none of them match the original image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
