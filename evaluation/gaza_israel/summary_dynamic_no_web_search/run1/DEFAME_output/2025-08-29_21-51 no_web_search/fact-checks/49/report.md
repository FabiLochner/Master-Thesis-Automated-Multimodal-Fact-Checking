Al-Monitor contains an image of Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 7589](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504677-755384.jpg)) from [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit).

The New York Times published an article on July 22, 2024, about Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 7590](media/2025-08-29_21-57-1756504677-897524.jpg)) from [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/world/middleeast/kamala-harris-netanyahu-congress-speech.html).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met on July 22, 2024, as indicated by the New York Times article and the CNN image. However, the provided evidence does not contain a direct quote from Kamala Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that quotes Kamala Harris making the statement on July 22, 2024, or a reliable source that reports on the meeting and includes the quote.
