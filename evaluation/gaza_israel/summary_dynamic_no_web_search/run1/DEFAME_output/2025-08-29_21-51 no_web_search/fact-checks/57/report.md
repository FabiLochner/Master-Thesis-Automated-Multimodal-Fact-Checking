## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on April 4, 2025, about Israeli troops expanding a security zone in northern Gaza, including a photograph of the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza City (![image 7674](media/2025-08-29_21-59-1756504768-686684.jpg)). The Guardian reported on an Israeli bombing of a shelter in Gaza City in April 2025, with a photograph of the aftermath (![image 7675](media/2025-08-29_21-59-1756504768-881481.jpg)). The BBC News website also contains an image of the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza City after an airstrike (![image 7676](media/2025-08-29_21-59-1756504768-982343.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025. However, the evidence does not mention the baby Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information about the baby.

## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025. However, there is no information about the baby Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm in an airstrike. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information about the baby.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-troops-expand-security-zone-northern-gaza-2025-04-04/), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/at-least-27-killed-in-israeli-bombing-of-shelter-in-gaza-city-rescuers-say), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo), there is no information available to confirm or deny the baby Sham Imad Muhareb's injury.
