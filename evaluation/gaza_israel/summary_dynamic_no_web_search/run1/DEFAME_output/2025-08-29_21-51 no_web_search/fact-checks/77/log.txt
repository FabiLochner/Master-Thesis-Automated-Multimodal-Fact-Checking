The claim 'Israel experienced an earthquake on October 5, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check, based on multiple image searches, found no evidence to support the claim of an earthquake in Israel on October 5, 2024. Instead, the search results primarily revealed reports and images related to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, with sources like [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/6/israel-kills-26-in-strike-on-gaza-mosque-school-orders-more-evacuations), [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/israel-and-palestine), and [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/International/live-updates/israel-gaza-hamas-war/?id=108860743) focusing on the destruction of buildings.

So, the overall veracity is: false
