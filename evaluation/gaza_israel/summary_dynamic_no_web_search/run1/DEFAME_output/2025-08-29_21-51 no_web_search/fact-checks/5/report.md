## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image in the claim (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in Lebanon. The image has been used in articles about an attempted attack near Gaza in 2019. The evidence also includes reports of Hezbollah downing an Israeli helicopter and claiming to shoot down an Israeli drone, but these events are not connected to the image in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim has been used in articles about an attempted attack near Gaza in 2019, and not in the context of an Israeli helicopter shot down in Lebanon. Therefore, the claim is false. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim (![image 6](media/5.jpg)
