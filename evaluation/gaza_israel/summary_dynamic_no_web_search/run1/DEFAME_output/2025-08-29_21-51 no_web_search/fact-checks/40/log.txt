The claim 'In June 1936, Columbia University expelled student activist Robert Burke for leading an anti-Nazi demonstration.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence confirms Robert Burke's expulsion from Columbia University in 1936 for anti-Nazi protests, as documented by sources like the [Columbia Magazine](https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/book-review-third-reich-ivory-tower) and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/1936/09/25/archives/columbia-hears-plea-for-expelled-student-burke-and-two-other.html). However, the exact month of the expulsion, June 1936, is not explicitly verified by the provided sources.

So, the overall veracity is: false
