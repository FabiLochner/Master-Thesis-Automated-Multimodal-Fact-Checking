Useful result: From [Source](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/israeli-strikes-yemen-sanaa-houthis-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article on December 26, 2024, about Israeli strikes in Yemen. <image:7456>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-bombs-houthis.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article about the bombing of Yemen in December 2024. The article includes an image of a damaged building. <image:7457>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image's geolocation suggests it was taken in Palestine or Israel, not Yemen. Furthermore, the image search reveals that Israeli strikes, not U.S. strikes, occurred in Yemen in December 2024, as reported by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/26/middleeast/israeli-strikes-yemen-sanaa-houthis-intl) and [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/world/middleeast/israel-yemen-bombs-houthis.html). The claim also incorrectly attributes the bombing's cause.

So, the overall veracity is: false
