## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.wjhl.com/news/national/military-recruitment-shortfall-should-us-bring-back-the-draft/): 
Content: WJHL.com published an image showing that the U.S. military struggles to recruit. The image states that 2024 is the projected smallest active-duty force since 1940. ![image 7425](media/2025-08-29_21-25-1756502748-372602.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the U.S. military is facing recruitment challenges, with 2024 projected to have the smallest active-duty force since 1940. However, the provided sources do not confirm the reinstitution of the draft. The images from 12newsnow.com and WTHR.com raise the question of the draft's return, but the linked articles deny the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, but the evidence does not confirm that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The evidence includes articles that deny the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The evidence, including images and articles from various news sources like [WTHR.com](https://www.wthr.com/video/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/us-military-draft-not-returning-amid-israel-hamas-war-video/536-9930ac14-0d8a-4908-b869-40bc5ae66aa6) and [12newsnow.com](https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0), does not support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. In fact, some sources explicitly deny the claim.
