The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The evidence, including images and articles from various news sources like [WTHR.com](https://www.wthr.com/video/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/us-military-draft-not-returning-amid-israel-hamas-war-video/536-9930ac14-0d8a-4908-b869-40bc5ae66aa6) and [12newsnow.com](https://www.12newsnow.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0), does not support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. In fact, some sources explicitly deny the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
