## Claim
Claim: "![image 3](media/2.jpg) This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 3](media/2.jpg))
image_search("woman holding skeleton Gaza")
image_search("woman holding skeleton Palestine")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The image of the woman holding a skeleton is AI-generated, according to [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/) and [news.abplive.com](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363). ![image 7431](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504335-308857.jpg) ![image 7433](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504337-097281.jpg)

The Daily Mail published an article with images of emaciated children in Gaza. ![image 7432](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504335-613722.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/mohammed-salem-world-press-photo-of-the-year-israel-hamas-war-1235006582/): 
Content: Rolling Stone published an article about the World Press Photo of the Year, which features a photograph of a woman in Gaza holding the body of her child wrapped in a shroud. ![image 7440](media/2025-08-29_21-52-1756504346-646991.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim that the image depicts an authentic scene is false. Evidence from image searches indicates that the image is AI-generated, as reported by [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/) and [news.abplive.com](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363). The evidence also includes an article from Rolling Stone about a World Press Photo of the Year, which features a photograph of a woman in Gaza holding the body of her child wrapped in a shroud.


## Final Judgement
The image is AI-generated, and therefore the claim that it is an authentic image is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is not authentic. Multiple sources, including [kashif.ps](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/) and [news.abplive.com](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363), confirm that the image is AI-generated.
