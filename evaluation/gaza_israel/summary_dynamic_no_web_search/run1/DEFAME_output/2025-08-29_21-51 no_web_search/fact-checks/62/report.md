## Actions

```

## Evidence

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.88, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'India': 0.02, 'Palestine': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/):

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. The `geolocate` action indicates that the image was most likely taken in Bangladesh. However, the `image_search` action provides a source that confirms the protest took place in Sohrawardi Park, Kolkata, India.

The claim states that the image shows a gathering in Kolkata, India, which is supported by the evidence from the `image_search` action. The evidence also supports the claim that the gathering was in solidarity with the Palestinian people.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts a protest in solidarity with the Palestinian people. While the geolocation suggests the image was taken in Bangladesh, the image search confirms the protest took place in Sohrawardi Park, Kolkata, India.
