Content: Axios reports on an attack in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024. <image:7546>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-27/rocket-attack-on-town-in-israeli-controlled-golan-heights-kills-at-least-10-netanyahu-hurries-home): 
Content: The Los Angeles Times reports on a rocket attack on a town in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, which killed at least 10 people. <image:7548>

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there were attacks in the Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, the provided evidence does not connect the image to the alleged event or confirm the specific details of the claim. The Anadolu Agency fact-checked the image and found no connection.

So, the overall veracity is: false
