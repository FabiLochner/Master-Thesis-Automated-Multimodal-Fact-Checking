## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 61](media/94.jpg) appears in multiple sources. One source is a VOA News article from January 24, 2018, titled "Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks" ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)). The article discusses a reported gas attack in Douma, Syria, on January 22, 2018.

Another source is a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east](https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east)) discussing chemical weapons usage in the Middle East. The image is also present in an ABC News article from January 23, 2018, titled "Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria" ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Al Jazeera website ([https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/22/entire-gaza-at-risk-of-famine-as-fighting-rages-between-israel-hamas](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/22/entire-gaza-at-risk-of-famine-as-fighting-rages-between-israel-hamas)) contains an image of a girl with a head injury ![image 7403](media/2025-08-29_21-25-1756502705-666716.jpg). The BBC News website ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68141039](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68141039)) contains an image of a baby in an incubator ![image 7404](media/2025-08-29_21-25-1756502705-822261.jpg).


## Elaboration
The image ![image 61](media/94.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image in question has been identified in multiple sources, including VOA News, CSIS, and ABC News, in articles discussing chemical weapons attacks in Syria in 2018. The claim states the image depicts a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. This is a misrepresentation of the image's origin and context.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from 2018 and depicts a situation in Syria, not the Gaza war in 2024, as evidenced by its appearance in news articles from VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)).
