The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from 2018 and depicts a situation in Syria, not the Gaza war in 2024, as evidenced by its appearance in news articles from VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201)).
