## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/): 
Content: Reuters reports on a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire deal. The article was published on August 15, 2024. ![image 7607](media/2025-08-29_21-58-1756504702-935513.jpg)


## Elaboration
The Reuters article ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)) confirms that Trump and Netanyahu spoke about a Gaza ceasefire deal. The article was published on August 15, 2024, which suggests the phone call occurred around that time. However, the article does not provide any information about the content of the conversation, specifically Trump's alleged statements regarding Kamala Harris's campaign.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence supporting Trump's specific statements and motivations.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Trump and Netanyahu had a phone call regarding a Gaza ceasefire deal around August 14, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While there is evidence of a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu regarding a Gaza ceasefire deal around August 14, 2024, as reported by Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Trump's motivations were related to Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign.
