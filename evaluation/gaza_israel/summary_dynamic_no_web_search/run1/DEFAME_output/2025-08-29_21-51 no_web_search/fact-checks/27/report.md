The same image (![image 6999](media/2025-08-29_21-13-1756502002-063306.jpg)) is also found in a World Jewish Congress article from June 19, 2017, about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on July 6, 2024, about the French parliamentary elections, including a photograph of a protest (![image 7511](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504540-716271.jpg)). Reuters published an article on July 8, 2024, about the French parliamentary elections, also including an image of a protest (![image 7512](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504540-993474.jpg)).

Bloomberg published an article on June 10, 2024, about the French far-right parties, including an image of Marine Le Pen (![image 7513](media/2025-08-29_21-55-1756504541-352682.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image (![image 20](media/27.jpg)) is from 2014 or earlier, as indicated by the Vanity Fair, World Jewish Congress, and Jerusalem Post articles. These articles discuss the image in the context of anti-Semitism and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The image search results show protests related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections, but the image in question is not among them. Therefore, the claim that the image shows a 2024 protest is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is from 2014 or earlier and is not related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections. The claim misrepresents the context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is from 2014 or earlier, as evidenced by articles from *Vanity Fair* and the *World Jewish Congress* ([https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market), [https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017)), and is unrelated to the 2024 French parliamentary elections.
