### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant postponed a visit to Washington ([https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/)). ![image 7542](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504589-547100.jpg)

Al Jazeera published an image of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant)). ![image 7543](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504589-759649.jpg) NPR published an image of Yoav Gallant ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)). ![image 7544](media/2025-08-29_21-56-1756504590-459260.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that he postponed a visit to Washington ([https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/)). Additionally, images from Al Jazeera and NPR show him alive in November 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/5/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-fires-defence-minister-yoav-gallant), [https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)).

The claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence, including a Reuters report from October 8, 2024, and images from Al Jazeera and NPR from November 2024, shows that Yoav Gallant was alive after the alleged date of his death. This directly contradicts the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/](https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-defense-minister-gallant-postpones-visit-washington-pentagon-says-2024-10-08/)) and images from Al Jazeera and NPR show that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024.
