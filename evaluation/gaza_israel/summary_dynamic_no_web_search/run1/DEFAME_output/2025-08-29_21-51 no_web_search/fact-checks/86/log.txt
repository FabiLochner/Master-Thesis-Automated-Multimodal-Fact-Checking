The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) exercise in the Baltic Sea in June 2024, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/474750/uss-mount-whitney-lcc-20-arrives-kiel-germany-marking-its-final-stop-after-completing-baltops-24)). The image does not depict U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.
