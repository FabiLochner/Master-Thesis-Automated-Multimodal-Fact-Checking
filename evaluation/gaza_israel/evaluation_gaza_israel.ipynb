       "7   President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a missile defense plan to defend the United States from ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles and other aerial threats, according to DefenseScoop. NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet.   \n",

USGS data shows that no earthquake occurred in Israel on or shortly before October 5th. No credible sources have reported that an earthquake occurred near Tel Aviv around October 5th. The EMSC made a post on X that verifies there is no data that indicates an earthquake occurred in Israel around October 5th. The caption reads, “#Israel 19 min ago⚠ We have no data confirming this crowdsourced detection. 👉 It likely was a false detection. No more info will be displayed in the thread. ” When asked for comment, EMSC told Check Your Fact, “we stress the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of this detection. The second message in the thread confirms that this detection has not been confirmed.” Check Your Fact has also reached out to USGS for comment. Due to the tension between Israel and Iran, many social media users have attributed the false detection to an alleged Iranian nuclear test. No reputable sources have reported that Iran conducted a nuclear test on or close to October 5th.   \n",

As protests spread over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran, access to Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked in September 2022. According to data from NetBlocks, authorities have responded with a series of internet restrictions, targeting all users registered with an Iranian (+98) phone number across all major network operators.   \n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the two Hamida children were not killed in a recent Israeli airstrike targeting Al-Jaouni school on July 6. Misbar's investigation team conducted searches using the names of the children and found earlier reports indicating that the children were killed in an Israeli assault on October 22, 2023. A Palestinian media agency published a photo of Mayar Hamida, reporting that she was killed along with her brother Bilal and their mother after Israel bombed their house in the Gaza Strip. The agency stated that they were killed on October 22, 2023. Misbar’s investigative team also found a published photo from October 22, 2023, showing a tweet from a friend of Nidal Hamida, the father of the two siblings. In the photo, Nidal Hamida is seen sitting in front of the bodies of his wife Fatima, his son Bilal, and his daughter Mayar, who were killed in their home while he was working as a news producer for the Palestine Today channel, according to the post’s description.   \n",

Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show \"American Ninja Warrior\" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here). Several US media outlets published images of Doman from his service in Iraq, which are similar to those used in the social media posts (archived here).   \n",

In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem, at the time annexed by Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.   \n",

The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.    \n",

A news report by The Times of Israel published on January 30, 2024, headlined, \"State approves repairs to pool in Netanyahu's Caesarea home – report,\" carried the same photo of the property. The image captioned, \"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea,\" was credited to Israeli public broadcaster KAN. The Times of Israel also used the photo for another article on Netanyahu's house published on July 19, 2024. Another report by Radio J, a French radio station that broadcasts information from the Jewish community, carried the same image in an article published on January 30, 2024, crediting the photo to KAN. Further, upon relevant Google searches in Hebrew, we found a video uploaded by KAN (archived here) on its YouTube channel on July 1, 2019, with the same visuals at the 0:07 timestamp. The video was originally titled in Hebrew and, when translated using Google, reads, \"The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.\"    \n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral circulation of the image, the screenshot was photoshopped, altering the original captioning of the poll behind the Israeli channel’s presenter. The poll, originally conducted by Channel 12 in May 2022, asked whether respondents agreed with the claim that the government's support leans on terror supporters. The original video showing Channel 12's presenter announcing the poll results was uploaded to YouTube on May 28, 2022. The translated caption of the Hebrew question from the Channel 12 poll reads, \"Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?\" Despite this, the image has been misrepresented on social media, with a false caption suggesting the poll asked if Israeli soldiers should be allowed to rape a prisoner.   \n",
       "86   A reverse image search led us to a report dated June 24, 2024, published on the official website of the U.S. Navy, titled \"BALTOPS 24 Concludes In Kiel, Germany.” The report also included the now-viral image. The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. The same image was used in a report on the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The photo, dated July 6, 2024, with the description “Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024,” was credited to Mario Coto, a U.S. Navy employee. NATO also posted this image on their official X (formerly Twitter) account (archived here) on June 10, 2024, with the caption, “19 Allies, 50+ ships, 85+ aircraft, 9,000 personnel are training together during the annual maritime exercise #BALTOPS24, where Allies will demonstrate NATO’s ability to preserve freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea.\"    \n",

These reports stated that the image shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who had died in the earthquake that hit Kahramanmaraş, a city in Turkey, on February 7. We found the same photograph on Getty Images credited to Adem Altan of the Agence France-Presse. There are multiple similar photos of the scene from different angles on Getty Images. Contrary to claims, the image does not originate from Gaza and does not depict a father holding the hand of his son, who was purportedly killed in an Israeli bombing and trapped under the rubble of their house.   \n",
