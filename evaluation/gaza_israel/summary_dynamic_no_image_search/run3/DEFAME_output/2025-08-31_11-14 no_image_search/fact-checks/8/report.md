## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)) and AP ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-26-2024-9c9f366c71c508e6dd0ee74cff8400d2](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-26-2024-9c9f366c71c508e6dd0ee74cff8400d2)) articles report that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for a ballistic missile assault. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran)) also reports on the airstrikes.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 8](media/8.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. One source, "[Islamic State" (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian), describes the image (![image 645](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873814-356134.jpg)) as a picture of an explosion over a city at night, dated October 20, 2024, and related to a raid in the Al-Laylaki area. Another source, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", also features the image (![image 648](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873818-669516.jpg)) with the same caption and a date of October 22, 2024.

A third source, "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)", includes the image (![image 649](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873823-228030.jpg)) in an article discussing the conflict between Israel and Gaza, and the role of Iran. The article mentions an Iranian drone and missile operation targeting Israeli military installations in April 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows Israel launching attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, is partially supported by the evidence. The web search confirms that Israel launched airstrikes on Iranian military targets on that date. However, the reverse image search reveals that the image is associated with events in October 2024, but the exact context is unclear. The image is also associated with an ISIS attack and an article about the conflict between Israel and Gaza.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the specific attacks on October 26, 2024. Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact event the image depicts and confirm its relation to the Israeli attacks on October 26, 2024.
