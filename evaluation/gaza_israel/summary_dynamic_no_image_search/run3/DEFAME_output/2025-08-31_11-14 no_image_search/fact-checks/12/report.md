## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's continued presence unlawful and obligating it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence. The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024, following a request from the General Assembly in December 2022.

The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg)

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024 regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to cease its presence, end settlement activities, and provide reparations. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ made a ruling in July 2024 regarding Israel's actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the ICJ declared Israel an illegal state.

The claim is partially false.


## Final Judgement
The ICJ's advisory opinion in July 2024 found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, but it did not declare Israel an illegal state. The ruling focused on the legality of Israel's actions in the occupied territories, not the state's overall legality.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful and obligating it to end its presence and cease settlement activities, as detailed in the ICJ's summary ([https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176](https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176)). However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.
