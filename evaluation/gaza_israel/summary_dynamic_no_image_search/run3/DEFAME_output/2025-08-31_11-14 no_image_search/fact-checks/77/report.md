## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 5, 2024, both Iran and Israel experienced earthquakes, which led to speculation about nuclear tests. An article from Johns Hopkins University, published on February 4, 2025, discusses misinformation linking the Iranian earthquake to a seismic event in Israel on the same evening. An article from NDTV, published on October 7, 2024, also mentions the earthquakes in Iran and Israel on October 5, 2024, and the speculation about nuclear tests. Another article from alphadefense.in, published on October 7, 2024, discusses a seismic event in Iran's Semnan province on October 5, 2024, and the speculation about whether it was an earthquake or an underground nuclear test. ![image 10616](media/2025-08-30_07-24-1756538674-713713.jpg), <image:k>, ![image 10629](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538710-708343.jpg), ![image 10631](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538723-858437.jpg), ![image 10632](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538725-517127.jpg)
