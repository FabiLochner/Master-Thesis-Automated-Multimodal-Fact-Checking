## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image of the exploded iPhone (![image 31](media/56.jpg)) is featured in multiple articles discussing explosions in Lebanon. One article from DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061)) states that the image is not related to the current attacks and dates back to March 2021.

Other sources, such as ITC.ua ([https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/](https://itc.ua/en/news/not-just-pagers-iphones-laptops-electronic-locks-and-other-devices-exploded-in-lebanon-today/)) and The China Academy ([https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/](https://thechinaacademy.org/israels-pager-attack-has-cooked-western-led-globalization/)), also use the image. The ITC.ua article reports on explosions targeting Hezbollah members, while The China Academy article discusses a "pager attack" and mentions at least 32 deaths and thousands of injuries. The ITC.ua article also includes another image (![image 343](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846049-318073.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 20, 2024, involving communication devices, some used by Hezbollah, resulting in at least 32 deaths and thousands injured. The explosions occurred near a crowd gathered for funerals and were caused by walkie-talkies and pagers. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz04m913m49o)) ![image 12158](media/2025-08-31_11-58-1756641484-812175.jpg), ![image 12161](media/2025-08-31_11-58-1756641486-018296.jpg)

The Lieber Institute of West Point discusses the explosive pagers attack on Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon and Syria on September 17, 2024, suggesting Israel's responsibility. ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) The Wikipedia article discusses the 2024 Lebanon electronic device attacks, also known as Operation Grim Beeper, which occurred on September 17-18, 2024, targeting Hezbollah members using pagers and walkie-talkies, resulting in 42 deaths and over 3,500 injuries.
