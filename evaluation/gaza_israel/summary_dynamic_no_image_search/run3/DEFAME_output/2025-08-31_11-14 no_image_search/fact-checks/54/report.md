## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon due to the conflict with Israel ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel), [https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/)). The U.S. government has also arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel, starting in October 2023, with flights to Europe, and has assisted with departure flights for U.S. citizens and lawful residents after the war between Hamas and Israel on October 7, 2023.

The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not supported by the evidence. The evidence indicates that the U.S. government has been assisting *American* citizens in leaving Israel.

The claim is partially supported, but it lacks information about the U.S. government flying Israeli citizens out of Israel.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon and has arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon due to the conflict with Israel, as reported by sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel) and [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/). The U.S. has also arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel since October 2023. However, the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the provided evidence.
