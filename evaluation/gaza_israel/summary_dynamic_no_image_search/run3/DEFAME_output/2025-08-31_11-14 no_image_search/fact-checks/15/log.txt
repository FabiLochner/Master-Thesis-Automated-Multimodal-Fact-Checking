The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was confirmed by reverse image search and web search results. However, the signs were altered to display pro-Palestinian slogans, which the city considered vandalism, and the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence, as the city considered the incident an act of vandalism.

So, the overall veracity is: false
