## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from Countercurrents.org, written by Dr. Marwan Asmar, reports on an Israeli bombing of a UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, stating that Mayar Haidar (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in the bombing, along with their mother and grandmother. The article also includes tweets reporting on the attack and the number of casualties. (![image 63](media/96.jpg)) [Source](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/)

A Wikipedia article discusses the Nuseirat rescue and massacre that occurred on June 8, 2024, in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, where the Israeli military killed at least 276 Palestinians and injured over 698 during the operation. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_rescue_and_massacre)


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The article from Countercurrents.org states that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The article also mentions their mother and grandmother were killed. However, the claim states the event happened on July 6, 2024, while the Wikipedia article mentions the Nuseirat rescue and massacre occurred on June 8, 2024.

The evidence supports the claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp by Israel. However, the exact date of the event is not consistent across the sources.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, along with their mother and grandmother. However, the exact date of the event is inconsistent across the sources.
