Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

 on July 29 that, due to Israel's ongoing military offensive and [blockade](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-30-2025-9b9b516f22e61bd1dde879733fdd97aa)

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1

According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:64>)
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israel support")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the provided sources do not mention the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the image is authentic. This could include a statement from Dwayne Johnson or a reliable source confirming the image's origin.


## Actions
```
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israeli flag image authenticity")
```

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:64>)
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israel support")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the provided sources do not mention the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the image is authentic. This could include a statement from Dwayne Johnson or a reliable source confirming the image's origin.


## Actions
```
web_search("Dwayne Johnson Israeli flag image authenticity")
```

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/reverse-image-search-for-fake-photos/): 
Content: "Even a basic Google search can uncover truths.

Search for “Lionel Messi with Israeli flag” and you’ll find stories from _USA Today_ and Reuters debunking the image along with reports from AFP Fact Check, which is a department within Agence France-Presse French news agency, and other fact-checking sites.

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has expressed his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, condemning terrorism and expressing sympathy for innocent lives lost in the conflict, as reported by [Shop Israel](https://shopisrael.com/blogs/support/does-dwayne-johnson-support-israel?srsltid=AfmBOopy4n2f7lxTWWqdiE6_xSd1XeW0AbQOVlP76nNPJQ6KrktIHL3X). He has also shown support for Israel amid the deadly Hamas attacks, according to [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/news/hollywood-stars-support-israel-palestine-conflict-1235749537/).

Marca.com, in an article published on October 11, 2023, discusses Johnson's views on the Israel-Palestine war, mentioning his Instagram post where he expressed his heartbreak and outrage at the events, condemning the actions of Hamas and the loss of innocent lives. The image of Johnson wearing the Israeli flag (<image:64>) is not mentioned in the provided sources.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel. However, the provided sources do not mention the image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the image is authentic. This could include a statement from Dwayne Johnson or a reliable source confirming the image's origin.

Content: The Yahoo News article, published on July 29, 2025, fact-checks a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are heartless criminals with no shred of humanity," is rated as "Incorrect Attribution" by Snopes. The article states that there is no credible record of Johnson making such a statement. The original post of the quote was found on an X account named Global Lens News (@Global_Lens_New). <image:12380>, <image:12381>, <image:12382>.
