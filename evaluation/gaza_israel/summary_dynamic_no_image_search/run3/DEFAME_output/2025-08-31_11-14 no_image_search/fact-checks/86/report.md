## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 55](media/86.jpg))
web_search("US warships Lebanon coast August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows the USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, which took place in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. ![image 55](media/86.jpg) The image is also found on a U.S. government website.

The article discusses NATO and its importance.


### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies (![image 8996](media/2025-08-30_00-22-1756513323-901835.jpg)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and mentions the presence of a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group in the Eastern Mediterranean (![image 8999](media/2025-08-30_00-22-1756513333-073992.jpg)). Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (![image 9009](media/2025-08-30_00-22-1756513354-558851.jpg)).

The U.S. has maintained an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships, and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region.


## Elaboration
The image provided in the claim shows the USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, which took place in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. This contradicts the claim that the image depicts U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.

However, web searches confirm that the U.S. did send more warships to the Middle East in August 2024. The USS Abraham Lincoln was heading to the Middle East, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group was present in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Therefore, the claim is false because the image does not depict the event described.


## Final Judgement
The image is of the USS Mount Whitney in Germany in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024. While the U.S. did send warships to the Middle East in August 2024, the image is not related to this event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim shows the USS Mount Whitney in Germany in June 2024, as confirmed by reverse image search, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024. While the U.S. did increase its military presence in the Middle East in August 2024, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/), and [Military.com](https://www.military.com/), the image is unrelated to this event.
