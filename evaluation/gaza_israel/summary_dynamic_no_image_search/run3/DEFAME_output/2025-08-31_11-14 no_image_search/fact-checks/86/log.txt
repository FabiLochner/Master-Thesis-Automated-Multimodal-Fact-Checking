Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks): 
Content: NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks. The report mentions that Israel expects an attack from Iran and its allies. <image:8996>

Useful result: From [Source](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel): 
Content: The USNI News article, published on August 2, 2024, reports that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East. <image:8999> The article mentions that the move is in response to threats from Iran.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html): 
Content: The search result from Military.com, published on September 20, 2024, discusses the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The article mentions that the U.S. has kept an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region. <image:9009> The article also mentions that several weeks ago, the total spiked to nearly 50,000 when the U.S. ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon.

The claim '<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim shows the USS Mount Whitney in Germany in June 2024, as confirmed by reverse image search, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024. While the U.S. did increase its military presence in the Middle East in August 2024, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), [USNI News](https://news.usni.org/), and [Military.com](https://www.military.com/), the image is unrelated to this event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
