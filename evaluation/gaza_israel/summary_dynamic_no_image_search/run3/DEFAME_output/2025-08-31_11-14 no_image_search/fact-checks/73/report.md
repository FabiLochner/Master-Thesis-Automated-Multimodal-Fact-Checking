## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 45](media/73.jpg)) appears in multiple articles. One article from NBC News, published on October 30, 2023, discusses a video that appears to show an Israeli tank firing at a car in Gaza ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-tank-fires-at-car-gaza-strip-rcna122801)).

Another article from ABC News, published on May 28, 2024, discusses the Israeli offensive in Rafah, Gaza ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-28/israel-rafah-offensive-gaza/103904720)). The image also appears in an article from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, discussing Russian views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ([https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations](https://globalaffairs.org/commentary-and-analysis/blogs/russian-youth-more-favorable-toward-israel-older-generations)).


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that the image has been used in articles related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically in Gaza. The articles mention events in October 2023 and May 2024.

The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests the image is related to events in Gaza, not Syria.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.


## Final Judgement
The image has been used in articles related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically in Gaza, and the articles mention events in October 2023 and May 2024. The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in question has been used in articles related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically in Gaza, and the articles mention events in October 2023 and May 2024. The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024 is not supported by the evidence, making the claim false.
