[### قصة الطفلة شام من تحت الأنقاض إلى مستشفى "برجيل" بأبو ظبي](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/633180)

> _**The nine-year-old Sham al-Sheikh Mohammed and her brother Omar have received wide interaction on social media since they got out after 40 hours from under the rubble in the town of Armanaz in the northern Idlib region following the massive earthquake that struck the area on February 6.**_

Sympathy for the child who sang “The Melody of Life” under the rubble was accompanied by political exploitation by the Syrian regime, whose media coverage was absent from Idlib during the first days of the earthquake and was present in the case of the child Sham, and some other cases through which it wanted to send a “political message.”

**Stuck under rubble**
----------------------

On February 7, volunteers from the Syria Civil Defense (SCD), also known as The White Helmets, rescued Sham and her brother Omar from under the rubble 40 hours after the earthquake that struck southern Turkey and four Syrian governorates. But Sham lost her mother and sister.

Sham read verses from the Holy Qur’an while she was stuck under the rubble of her house and sang the song “Ya Sham, you are our Sham” (Ash-Sham: The colloquial name of Damascus), inspiring hope in the hearts of the people and volunteers.

After her rescue, she was transferred to al-Shifaa Hospital in Idlib city.

Dr. Mohammad al-Youssef, director of the intensive care unit at al-Shifa Hospital, said in a [video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW4ZkGozYDA)
 that the pressure of the rubble on the child’s lower limbs led to the interruption of blood flow to them, and they were threatened with amputation.

Sham and her brother suffered from crush syndrome, which posed a great threat to their lives, in conjunction with the great pressure in hospitals in northern Syria and the lack of medical equipment and supplies.

**From Idlib to Adana**
-----------------------

On February 23, ambulances transported the child Sham and her brother, accompanied by their father, to Adana Şehir Hospital in Adana state, southern Turkey, after supervision and coordination between the health ministry of the Syrian Salvation Government (SSG) operating in Idlib, and the Turkish authorities.

The child and her brother remained in the [emergency department](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1330973717761556)
 designated to receive all cases and not in the intensive care unit, with the cries of the child and her brother and demanded to return them to Idlib during their appearance in a video recording.

Their presence in the emergency department requires them to receive painkillers only and to wait until they get a turn to perform the operation at an unspecified time due to the overcrowding in the hospital, with the lack of coordination between the hospital staff and any party.

A video of the child in pain from inside the hospital received wide interaction, followed by activists on social media launching a campaign to save her, entitled “Save Sham and Omar.”

Hussein Bazar, health minister in the [Salvation Government](https://t.me/SG_M_Health/2189)
, said that the ministry is following up on the medical situation and the care provided to Sham and her brother after they entered Turkish territory to complete their treatment for crush syndrome on a permanent basis.

Upon noticing the delay in receiving the required care for their difficult condition, and after communication, “we received confirmation from high-ranking Turkish medical authorities to follow up the case directly,” Bazar added.

_The 9-year-old Sham in a hospital in Idlib after she was rescued from under the rubble in Armanaz town in Idlib countryside, following an earthquake that struck the area – February 7, 2023 (Facebook/White Helmets)_

**From Adana to Istanbul**
--------------------------

On February 25, the little girl and her brother, accompanied by their father, arrived in Istanbul on a private plane belonging to the Turkish Health Ministry to receive treatment in coordination with the [Ataa for Humanitarian Relief](https://ataarelief.org/en/)
 organization, which followed up on the case directly.

Ataa administration told _Enab Baladi_ that the role of the association was represented in sponsoring the accompanying family in terms of housing, transportation, and clothes, coordinating the transfer of Sham, her brother, and the family from Adana to Istanbul, and securing their admission to the Çam ve Sakura government hospital in the Başakşehir region.

Ataa pointed out that the Turkish government provided a private plane from the ministry of health to transport Sham and her brother from Adana to Istanbul and to host them in the Çam ve Sakura Hospital at the government’s expense, with the provision of a specialized medical staff to follow up on the case.

**From Istanbul to Abu Dhabi**
------------------------------

On February 28, the child and her brother were transferred to Burjeel Medical City in Abu Dhabi to receive treatment under the supervision of the Emirates Red Crescent and in cooperation with [Burjeel Hospital](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1604241-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%82%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%87%D8%A7-2022?q=%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84&r=1601612)
, which formed a specialized medical team for the child and her brother, and provided urgent treatment for them.

After the two children arrived at the hospital, surgeries were performed by Dr. Michael Oğlu, as the life of the child Sham was threatened as a result of gangrene that spread in the lower part of the body, and her brother Omar was also saved, according to the Emirates News Agency (WAM).

The agency said that Sham and Omar arrived under the directives of the Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation, Honorary President of the Emirates Red Crescent (Mother of the Nation), Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak.

Ataa Relief told _Enab Baladi_ that the child was transferred to the Emirates after its consulate contacted Sham’s father, as the Turkish authorities left the matter to her father, who agreed to transfer her and transfer the entire family to the Emirates to complete the treatment of Sham and her brother Omar in the UAE hospitals.

**Asma al-Assad exploits Sham’s condition**
-------------------------------------------

The Syrian regime’s officials and media coverage ignored mentioning Idlib governorate when talking about the areas affected by the earthquake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double the number of deaths in the areas under the regime’s control.

The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the day after the earthquake ignored Idlib when it mentioned the affected areas, limiting itself to mentioning Aleppo, Latakia, and Hama in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions.

On the fifth day of the earthquake, February 10, the regime mentioned Idlib for the first time during the disaster when it included it by announcing the areas affected by the earthquake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia, and Idlib).

Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian Sama channel, published on February 25, quoting what he called “private sources,” that the “Syrian government” is trying through several channels, with Russian and Emirati mediation, to [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 the Turkish authorities to hand over the child Sham and her brother to the Syrian health authorities to send them to the Emirates for treatment.

He stated that efforts are continuing to include the two children with six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia, who arrived for treatment in the UAE at the initiative of the “Syrian Presidency,” adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said, on March 1, that the child, [Sham](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
, is in the UAE to be treated and that the efforts of the “Syrian State” have succeeded after “Turkey has repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political ends.”

Asma al-Assad, the wife of the head of the Syrian regime, appeared in a video recording published by the “Presidency of the Syrian Republic” page on Facebook, which includes a recorded call with the child Sham, which caused a wave of anger and resentment among the Syrians, who considered it “political exploitation and trading in the pain of the Syrians.”

Asma al-Assad hinted that she was aware of the child’s transfer and arrival to the Emirates, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Sham appeared in a video in one scene with her head shaved and wearing a hat in another scene, which raised suspicions that the recording was subjected to a “montage” and “editing” process.

**Family ‘doesn’t know’**
-------------------------

With the spread of the recording of Asma al-Assad’s call with Sham, local pages and activists shared audio recordings of the child’s father, who denied knowing about Asma al-Assad’s call, saying, “I was not in the hospital, and I had no knowledge of the call, and I heard about it just like you.”

The father explained that he was not satisfied from the beginning with the removal of his two children from Idlib governorate, adding, “I never had the desire to leave, but they told me that I had to travel under the pretext of securing doctors and housing for us. I will not forgive them before God; they destroyed my children.”

Activists also circulated an audio recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said that his father was not aware of the call, but people do not understand this matter.

**Children, victims of the regime**
-----------------------------------

The Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that the Syrian regime had killed no less than 22,981 children in Syria since March 2011, including 190 due to torture, and 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR stated that the regime assigned the task of recruiting children to the unofficial forces it formed, such as the National Defense Forces and groups and brigades of foreign and local militias, through its affiliation centers.

These forces relied on the encouragement of children and their families and provided them with many facilities. The recruitment process took on a more organized and systematic character with the formation of the National Defense Forces.

According to the monitoring group, children participated in military operations, whether as combatants or as participants in transporting ammunition, strengthening the fronts, cleaning weapons, guarding, and other missions.

**Asma Assad takes advantage of Sham’s conditions**
---------------------------------------------------

Neither regime officials nor media reports mentioned Idlib province when referring to areas affected by the quake, despite the fact that the death toll there was more than double that of regime-controlled areas.

In a statement issued the day after the earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not mention Idlib when referring to the affected area, and only mentioned Aleppo, Latakia and Khazanah in the statement calling for the lifting of sanctions. horse.

On February 10, the fifth day of the quake, the authorities mentioned Idlib for the first time when announcing the areas affected by the quake (Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and Idlib).

On February 25, Nizar al-Farra, a TV host on the pro-regime Syrian channel Sama, published an article citing what he called a “private source” that the “Syrian government” was trying to reach through multiple channels , under the mediation of Russia and the UAE, [persuade](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0AozU4hzimZyQepTcUFSnhgXyuYWUHi8BB4mSyFEswjAfsHbW1P388vKeSYftMndAl)
 Turkish authorities handed over the child, Sham, and her brother to Syrian health authorities so they could be sent to the UAE for treatment.

Efforts are continuing, he said, including two children from Aleppo and Latakia and six Syrian children from Aleppo and Latakia who arrived in the UAE for treatment at the initiative of the “President of Syria”. , adding that the Turkish side still refuses to hand over the child or even send her directly to the UAE for treatment.

Al-Farra said on March 1 that the child, [Fake](https://www.facebook.com/nizar.alfarra.16/posts/pfbid0oaeTUQTdyQNQXFaJEHyArKXnSV8wCKUujovauZZyT7Xu6TcGVb8VzRYYxV3HDX6nl)
who is receiving treatment in the UAE, the efforts of the “Syrian state” were successful after “Turkey repeatedly refused to send her and exploited her situation and health for political purposes.”

The wife of the head of the Syrian regime, Asma al-Assad, appeared on Facebook’s “Presidential Palace of the Syrian Republic” page and posted a video recording, including a recording of a call with her child Sham, which sparked a wave of anger and dissatisfaction among Syrians. Think it’s a “political exploitation and painful deal for Syrians”.

Asma al-Assad implied she knew the children had been diverted and arrived in the UAE, telling Sham, “You have to come back to me.”

Shan appears in a video with her head shaved in one scene and a hat in another, making it suspicious that the recording was “montaged” and “edited”.

As recordings of Asma Assad’s call with Sham circulated, local webpages and activists shared the recording of the father, who denied knowing Asma Assad’s phone call, saying: “I was not in the hospital at the time. , I don’t know about this call, I’ve heard of it just like you.”

The father explained that he was dissatisfied with taking his two children from Idlib province from the beginning, adding, “I never thought about leaving, but they told me I had to Getting doctors and housing as an excuse to travel for us. I will not forgive them before God; they ruined my child.”

Activists also circulated a recording said to be of her brother Omar, who said his father was unaware of the call, but people were not aware of it.

Syrian Network for Human Rights ([SNHR](https://snhr.org/arabic/2023/03/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%86%d8%b8%d8%a7%d9%85-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%b1%d9%8a-%d9%82%d8%aa%d9%84-%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%84-%d8%b9%d9%86-22981-%d8%b7%d9%81%d9%84%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a/)
) said on March 13 that since March 2011, the Syrian regime has killed at least 22,981 children in Syria, of which 190 were killed as a result of torture, and another 5,199 children are still detained or forcibly disappeared.

SNHR said the regime, through its affiliated centers, assigned the task of recruiting children to unofficial forces it formed, such as groups and brigades of the National Defense Forces and foreign and local militias.

These forces rely on the encouragement of the children and their families and provide them with many facilities. With the creation of the Wehrmacht, the recruitment process was more organized and systematic.

The Monitoring Group understands that children are involved in military operations, both as combatants and in tasks such as delivering ammunition, fortifying front lines, cleaning weapons, and guarding.

Tyrants learn from each other, share information, and observe the tactics of repression used by the world’s dictators and autocrats to reproduce in their own countries. Arbitrary arrests of dissidents, torture in prisons, attacks on activists’ family members, or the use of artificial intelligence to control the population are repeated almost systematically in most authoritarian regimes. “From Egypt and Iran to Russia and Venezuela, dictators copy and cooperate with each other,” warns Iranian journalist and dissident Masih Alinejad. Her denunciation coincides with the account of the dozens of defenders of human rights gathered last June at the [Oslo Freedom Forum](https://oslofreedomforum.com/norway-2023/)
, the activist convention organized every year by the [Human Rights Foundation (HRF).](https://hrf.org/)
 Their testimonies make up what could be considered a guide to the actions of modern dictators and autocrats, a set of traditional forms of repression reinforced by the options offered by new technology and the constant concern over their public image.

### Arbitrary arrests

The arbitrary detention of activists, journalists, or opponents without legitimate reasons or without due process is “a fundamental weapon of autocratic regimes,” says Félix Maradiaga. He is one of the 200 Nicaraguan political prisoners whom [Daniel Ortega’s regime banished to the United States last February](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-02-09/nicaragua-frees-over-200-political-prisoners-puts-them-on-plane-to-us.html)
 after depriving them of their nationality. “They know that by arresting dissidents they divert attention from political movements, which are forced to pause for a while and stop talking about reforms in education and health or addressing issues such as corruption,” he continues. His own experience is proof: after announcing his pre-candidacy for the presidency of the country in 2021, he was arrested on charges of “treason” and spent “611 agonizing days in one of the most atrocious maximum-security prisons in Latin America.”

The aim of these arrests, according to Venezuelan journalist Victor Navarro, is to spread terror. “Autocratic regimes feed on fear and are strengthened by silence,” he summarizes. He too was detained “arbitrarily.” “I worked in social reintegration, but in Venezuela offering opportunities can be considered a crime,” says the activist, who was accused of “treason” and “terrorism.” “About 35 police officers broke down the door of my house,” he recalls. He was locked up for five months.

Uighur Gulbahar Haitiwaji, on the other hand, had “never been involved” in political or social activities. But Xi Jinping’s regime found her guilty of “disloyalty to the Chinese government,” as part of [Beijing’s crackdown on members of the Muslim minority](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-24/secret-police-files-put-a-face-to-chinas-repression-in-xinjiang-child-prisoners-and-shoot-to-kill-orders.html)
 — some 11.6 million people — in the Xinjiang autonomous region. “I lived in France with my husband and daughters and, following a call from my former employer, I planned a two-week return trip \[to Xinjiang\]... I had no idea what was waiting for me there,” recalls the woman, who spent three years in so-called “re-education centers,” internment camps where Beijing exercises its crackdown on Uighurs.

### Torture

[Beatings, rape and inhuman and degrading treatment](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-03-26/the-rampant-abuse-in-el-salvadors-prisons-they-beat-him-to-death-in-the-cell-and-dragged-him-out-like-an-animal.html)
 are a constant in the testimony of those who have been arrested for political reasons. “In prison I suffered things that I am not yet prepared to talk about in public,” says Nicaraguan Maradiaga.

[Torture](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-05-29/inmates-in-el-salvador-tortured-and-strangled-a-report-denounces-hellish-conditions-in-bukeles-prisons.html)
 is first and foremost an attempt at “dehumanization,” Navarro says. “I was number 25510806,” the code he was assigned after entering Venezuela’s Helicoide prison. The aggressions, he reveals, were continuous. “They wouldn’t let me sleep; I heard another prisoner being suffocated, the sound of rape...,” recalls the activist, who says he went 129 days without seeing sunlight.

A red bracelet on Haitiwaji’s ankle reminds her that she survived torture in Xinjiang detention centers. The officers squeezed her shackles so tightly that they made her bleed. And in the midst of the pain, she says she whispered: “My poor ankle, you have suffered so much for me, if I ever manage to leave this place I promise that I will adorn you with a beautiful chain.” It was one of the many times the woman was interrogated in one of the so-called “tiger chairs”: “They put a black hood on us, handcuffed our hands and ankles.” But those were not the only times she was tortured: “I was chained to a bed for 20 days and the humiliation I felt was unbearable. I struggled for 10 days not to relieve myself in front of them. In the end, with a very strong pain in my stomach, I relieved myself in tears.”

The one who cannot recount the torture he suffered is Alaa Abd El-Fattah. This blogger and intellectual symbol of the Egyptian opposition has been imprisoned for almost four years after being convicted in an express trial for allegedly spreading false information on social networks. But one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, speaks on his behalf and says that the situation is so terrible that her brother had even thought about suicide: “He said that his life was unbearable, because the worst thing was not torture, but that they deprived him of everything that gave meaning to his life, such as sunlight, music, and books... He said he lived like an animal.”

### Attacks on family members

In their strategy of spreading terror, dictators and autocrats strive to show that a dissident’s activism puts their family at risk. This is what happened to Haitiwaji. “They questioned me about my life in France, they showed me a photograph of my daughter covering herself with an East Turkestan flag \[symbol of the Uighur independence movement\] during a protest,” recalls the woman, who ended up signing a confession in which she declared that she had “gathered people to disturb the social order.”

Sanaa Seif did end up in prison three times for demanding her brother’s freedom. Aware of the pain that the detention of a loved one inflicts on families, she recounts how she combed her hair and put on makeup to try to look her best during the 20-minute visit with her mother or sister that the authorities allowed her once a month.

Beyond the arrest itself, the [psychological damage caused to families by the detention of a family member is very profound](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-11/mothers-by-force-the-silent-impact-of-president-bukeles-state-of-exception-in-el-salvador.html)
. “When they arrested me, my mom was told to look for me at the morgue,” Navarro laments. Sharing a similar anguish is Evgenia Kara-Murza, wife of Russian journalist and President Putin’s political opponent Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for high treason because “his voice was a danger to Putin’s regime.” “The pain of having someone you love in prison is immense,” she says.

### Kleptocrat practices

“It happens in Sudan, in Yemen, in Russia, in China, in Iran... They are kleptocrat regimes,” says Casey Michel, HRF’s program director against systems of governance that prioritize the enrichment of the rich at the expense of the public interest. [Kleptocracy](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/11/the_global_observer/1528717970_008019.html)
 is, according to Casey, one of the hallmarks of authoritarian systems, but warns that it is “a transnational phenomenon.” “Autocracies and dictatorships use the financial secrecy of places like Delaware \[United States\] to take money out of their country, whether it’s Equatorial Guinea or Angola, and enjoy it wherever they want,” he complains.

This is well known to activist Ketakandriana Rafitoson, the only judge in Madagascar who has resigned due to interference in justice, has spent her entire life dedicated to the fight against corruption. “This is the source of extreme poverty in my country,” she stresses, a state in which 75% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. “Successive leaders chose corruption as a way to govern the country,” she laments. And, as an example, she gives a figure that she considers unaffordable: “In 2013, one of the candidates for the presidential elections spent $43 million (€38.3 million) on a single campaign, in a country where people go hungry.” “If 36 candidates participated in the 2018 elections, how much money was wasted?” she asks.

> “It is a mistake to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil.”
> 
> Thor Halvorssen, founder of the Human Rights Foundation

The big mistake, according to Thor Halvorssen, founder of HRF, is “to believe that there are different dictatorships, right and left, socialist and capitalist, when the reality is that it is a question of good and evil,” he states. This classification, “whose objective is to divide people,” leads one to think, according to Halvorssen, that [Venezuela](https://english.elpais.com/international/2023-06-14/venezuelas-economic-crisis-has-led-to-a-surge-in-suicides.html)
’s regime is, for example, socialist. “But it’s not, because everyone in power is a millionaire or a billionaire,” he says.

### The care of the international image

Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, held a video call last March with Sham Sheikh Mohammed, a nine-year-old Syrian girl who survived the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, while she was receiving treatment in a hospital in Abu Dhabi. “She was trapped for more than 40 hours,” says Syrian activist Abdulrahman Almawwas, co-founder of the White Helmets, the Syrian volunteer organization specializing in rescues. The hurtful thing about that call is that the girl Assad phoned lived “in northern Syria[, an area that has been attacked and bombed by Damascus for the](https://elpais.com/internacional/2023-02-12/la-siria-rebelde-la-gran-olvidada-del-terremoto.html)
 last 10 years,” explains Almawwas, who also criticizes how dictators try to “clean up their crimes before international public opinion.”

But the most recent illustrative example of how authoritarian regimes try to whitewash their image is, for Sanaa Seif, the celebration of the United Nations Climate Summit in the Egyptian town of Sharm el Sheikh in November of last year. “Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s regime didn’t want the stories of political prisoners to spread, so I took the risk of flying there,” she said. Her brother was on hunger strike at the time to demand improvements in his detention conditions. “Climate activists from all over the world chanted the name of Alaa and \[British Prime Minister\] Rishi Sunak, \[German Chancellor\] Olaf Scholz and \[French President\] Emmanuel Macron called for his release,” she recalls. Her brother’s prison conditions suddenly improved.

### The use of new technology

Rwandan activist Carine Kanimba’s mobile phone was infected with [Pegasus spy software](https://english.elpais.com/international/2022-05-03/pegasus-europes-deepening-spyware-scandal.html)
. The young woman, daughter of Rwandan opponent Paul Rusesabagina, the famous former manager of the Hotel Mille Collines — which Hollywood immortalized in the film _Hotel Rwanda_ — has been protesting since 2020 that her father was kidnapped from his home in San Antonio (Texas) and taken to Rwanda, where he was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Resesabagina, an opponent of President Paul Kagame, “would never have traveled” to the African country, says his daughter, who with the help of several organizations says she discovered that the Rwandan government had been “tracking the whole family.”

“All dictatorships do the same things, although they seem to be very different; for example, now they have started using artificial intelligence and facial recognition cameras,” explains Serbian activist Srdja Popovic, promoter of the student mobilizations that precipitated the fall of former Serbian dictator Slobodan Misolevic, and current director of the Center for the Application of Nonviolent Actions and Strategies (CANVAS). So it was for Haitiwaji. “When they arrested me, they took blood samples, scanned my face and irises and recorded a sample of my voice,” she says.

And dictators share these systems, warns Nathan Law, one of the leaders of Hong Kong’s so-called umbrella revolution. “China has taken advantage of the preoccupation of the narrative that prioritizes security over freedom and sells technology that serves to identify people,” warns the young man, currently exiled in London. This software_,_ remember, has only one purpose: to suppress protests and ensure the survival of the regime.

 The EU called for an independent investigation and accountability, describing the attack a possible [war crime](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")

CNN  — 

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit a school being used by displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 30 people including several children, as the country’s negotiators prepared to meet international mediators to discuss a proposed cease-fire.

At least seven children and seven women were among the dead taken from the girls' school in Deir al-Balah to Al Aqsa Hospital. Israel's military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against Israeli troops and develop and store "large quantities of weapons.” Hamas in a statement called the military’s claim false.

Civil defense workers in Gaza said thousands had been sheltering in the school, which also contained a medical site.

According to Israeli estimates, about 1.8 million Palestinians shelter in the zone after being uprooted multiple times during Israel’s punishing air and ground campaign. "What happens is when people have these orders, they have very little time to move.”

Associated Press journalists saw a dead toddler in an ambulance and bodies covered with blankets. Israel expanded the zone in May to take in people fleeing the southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s population at the time had crowded.

Gaza Health Ministry officials said the evacuation orders had forced at least three health centers to stop providing care and compounded issues such as piled-up waste and shortages of supplies.

The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. The search results mention attacks that resulted in casualties, including children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or its context.

To verify the claim, I need to know if the image is related to any of the events mentioned in the search results. I also need to confirm the child's identity and the circumstances surrounding the image.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

“It is nearly impossible to collect and verify information under the current conditions in Gaza,” the group said, “but at least 17,000 children are believed to be unaccompanied and separated and approximately 4,000 children are likely missing under the rubble, with an unknown number also in mass graves”.

 in Gaza since October 7, while others are suffering from severe malnutrition and do not “even have the energy to cry”, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said in a report earlier this year.

“Since October, Gaza has faced relentless violence which has killed over 37,000 people, including thousands of children. Children in Gaza are the big cost of the Israeli genocide in Gaza,” Quzmar said.

International criticism has mounted amid the growing death toll in the war, as well as the deteriorating humanitarian crisis.

However, on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [reiterated](/news/2024/6/23/netanyahu-says-war-will-continue-even-if-deal-agreed-with-hamas)
 that he would not agree to any deal that stipulated an end to Israel’s war on Gaza.

aj-logo It follows an attack in Israel by Palestinian armed groups that killed over a thousand people, including at least 33 children,” the Save the Children report reads.

It also notes that about 250 Palestinian children are also missing in the occupied West Bank, as of 9 June.

Accountability
--------------

Jeremy Stoner, Save the Children’s regional director for the Middle East, has called for an independent investigation into the situation surrounding Gaza’s missing children, and for accountability.

“Families are tortured by the uncertainty of the whereabouts of their loved ones. No child should be detained or held hostage,” he added.

Khaled Quzmar, the general director of the child rights organisation Defense for Children International Palestine, told Al Jazeera that the impact that they have witnessed in the conflict in Gaza is at a level previously unseen, even during the second world war.

“It is a war against children. No parent should have to dig through rubble or mass graves to try and find their child’s body. No child should be alone, unprotected in a war zone."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions

reverse_search(<image:59>)
web_search("Israeli airstrike Gaza July 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:59>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July 2024. One source, a Wikipedia article, details the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack, which resulted in numerous casualties and international condemnation. Another source, a CNN article, reports on an airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, resulting in at least 30 deaths. An NPR article also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza being used as a shelter, resulting in at least 30 deaths, including children. <image:59>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. The search results mention attacks that resulted in casualties, including children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or its context.

To verify the claim, I need to know if the image is related to any of the events mentioned in the search results. I also need to confirm the child's identity and the circumstances surrounding the image.

Insufficient information to verify the claim.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry."

Civil defence teams carry a body after the strike in Khan Younis

An Israeli air strike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor and killed nine of her 10 children, the hospital where she works in the city of Khan Younis says.

Nasser hospital said one of Dr Alaa al-Najjar's children and her husband were injured, but survived.

Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital who operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy, told the BBC it was "unbearably cruel" that his mother, who spent years caring for children as a paediatrician, could lose almost all her own in a single missile strike.

Israel's military said its aircraft had struck "a number of suspects" in Khan Younis on Friday, and "the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review".

A video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its "aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis".

Adam, 11, is Dr Alaa al-Najjar's only surviving child

Mr Groom said the children's father was "very badly injured", in a video [posted on the Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/rosieplasticsurgeon/reel/DKAuybutk08/)
 of another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose.

He told the BBC that the father had a "penetrating injury to his head".

He said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had "no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media".

He described it as an "unimaginable" situation for Dr Alaa al-Najjar.

Mr Groom said the surviving 11-year-old boy, Adam, was "quite small" for his age.

"His left arm was just about hanging off, he was covered in fragment injuries and he had several substantial lacerations," he told the BBC.

"Since both his parents are doctors, he seemed to be among the privileged group within Gaza, but as we lifted him onto the operating table, he felt much younger than 11."

"Our little boy could survive, but we don't know about his father," he added.

Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis.

The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.

Another doctor, Youssef Abu al-Rish, said in a statement posted by the health ministry that he had arrived to the operating room to find Dr al-Najjar waiting for information about her surviving son and tried to console her.

In an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: "Enough!

Israeli strike kills nine of Gaza doctor's children

! Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety," the Israeli military said.

In a general statement on Saturday, the IDF said it had struck more than 100 targets across Gaza over the past day.

The health ministry said at least 74 people had been killed by the Israeli military over the 24 hour-period leading up to about midday on Saturday.

Dr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the al-Najjars' family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work.

Dr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.

! <image:12360>!Al-Najjar family Adam, 11, is Dr Alaa al-Najjar's only surviving child. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday.

The UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more.

The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread.

A UN-backed assessment this month said Gaza's population was at "critical risk" of famine.

People in Gaza have told the BBC they have no food, and malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed babies.

Chronic shortages of water are also worsening as desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel, and Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement.

Israel has said the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza.

Israel has accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.

Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 53,901 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

A 25-day-old baby has been rescued from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza following an air strike.

The air strike killed her parents, her brother and another family that included a father and his seven children.

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire with Hamas.

A 25-day-old baby has been rescued from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza. 

After hearing cries of a baby from underneath concrete rubble in Khan Younis, rescuers dug down to find the infant alive. 

Rescuers wrapped the child in a blanket and rushed her to a nearby ambulance crew where she stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over. 

Calls of "God is great" rang out from the rescuers and onlookers.

[Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza](/news/2025-03-18/israel-attacks-targets-in-gaza-as-ceasefire-deadlock-breaks/105066816)
 on Tuesday, shattering the ceasefire with Hamas.

Israel blamed the renewed fighting on Hamas because the militant group rejected a new proposal for the second phase of the ceasefire that departed from their signed agreement, which was mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt.

Nearly 600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, [including more than 400 on Tuesday alone](/news/2025-03-18/israel-military-conducts-strikes-hamas-targets-gaza/105064588#live-blog-post-160719)
, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl's home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

The Israel military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it is deeply embedded in residential areas. 

Hours later, the Israeli military [restored a blockade on northern Gaza](/news/2025-03-20/israeli-strikes-kill-38-including-un-worker-in-gaza/105073764)
, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Her parents and brother died in the [overnight Israeli air strike on Khan Younis](/news/2025-03-21/at-least-91-killed-in-latest-gaza-strikes/105079212)
.

Only the girl's grandparents survived the attack. Her brother, mother and father were killed, along with another family that included a father and his seven children.

"When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn," said Hazen Attar, a civil defence first responder.

"She had been screaming and then falling silent from time to time until we were able to get her out a short while ago, and thank God she is safe."

Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of another child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

Family knew war would return
----------------------------

The girl's grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, wept over the loss, and the return to the devastation of war.

"We weren't really living in a truce," she said.

"We knew that at any moment the war might return.

> "We never felt that there was stability, not at all."

She took turns holding her grandchild with other women in a relative's house in the area.

Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the most recent strikes with only the baby surviving.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella's family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

"People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family," he said.

The UNRWA Media Advisor Adnan Abu Hasna told Al Jazeera he estimated that the number of displaced people sheltering at the school stood at 2000 however this figure was far too low according to other experts on the ground.

.

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-rw10oct-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. [Ynet](/wiki/Ynet "Ynet")
 reported that she also cooked at times with basic ingredients she was provided.[\[36\]](#cite_note-toimalnutrition-38)

The [Qassam Brigades](/wiki/Qassam_Brigades "Qassam Brigades")
 (the militant wing of the Hamas movement) claimed that three other hostages were killed as a result of the raid.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
[\[41\]](#cite_note-43)
 They did not name any of them, or show photographs, but they claimed that one of the three was a US citizen and released a short video with text in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)
 The video depicted three unidentifiable corpses with their faces obscured by censor bars.[\[42\]](#cite_note-44)
 The Brigades did not give details of how the hostages supposedly died, but said they were killed by the Israeli military.[\[c\]](#cite_note-46)

> "In exchange for them, your own army killed 3 of your own captives in the same attack; one of them holds a USA citizenship" - Qassam Brigades, 9 June 2024.[\[22\]](#cite_note-AJ_-_3_killed-24)

Rescue
------

The IDF said that they worked with [Shin Bet](/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet")
 and Israeli police to free the four Israeli hostages.[\[44\]](#cite_note-ynet8june-47)
 It was also later reported that the operation was [aided by intelligence support from the United States](/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war "United States support for Israel in the Gaza war")
[\[45\]](#cite_note-cbs8junebrennan-48)

.[\[46\]](#cite_note-49)
 The operation was planned for several weeks, and was carried out after an intelligence opportunity arose.[\[14\]](#cite_note-bbc-16)
 Some of the special forces members entered the refugee camp in a vehicle with a mattress on top, posing as [Palestinian refugees](/wiki/Gaza_Strip_evacuations "Gaza Strip evacuations")

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The article from Countercurrents.org states that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The article also mentions their mother and grandmother were killed. However, the claim states the event happened on July 6, 2024, while the Wikipedia article mentions the Nuseirat rescue and massacre occurred on June 8, 2024.

The evidence supports the claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp by Israel. However, the exact date of the event is not consistent across the sources.

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results do not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US. The evidence focuses on the US's support for Israel and a draft resolution on the war in Gaza. One source discusses the return of the military draft, but it does not specify that it was reinstituted in 2024.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

 avoiding the potential constraint on militia service that it can only be used "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")

 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

US vetoes Security Council resolution demanding permanent ceasefire in Gaza
===========================================================================

**By** **Vibhu Mishra**

4 June 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

A draft resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Wednesday after the United States cast its veto – blocking the initiative backed by all ten elected members of the Council.

The text, co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia – collectively known as the E-10 – received 14 votes in favour, with the US casting the lone vote against.

As one of the council’s five permanent members, the US holds veto power – a negative vote that automatically blocks any resolution from going forward.

Had it been adopted, the draft would have demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” to be respected by all parties.

> [](https://twitter.com/UN_News_Centre/statuses/1930358040437420409)

Release all hostages
--------------------

The text reaffirmed the Council’s earlier call for the “**immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups**.”

The draft also expressed grave concern over the “**catastrophic humanitarian situation**” in Gaza – following months of almost total Israeli aid blockade – including the risk of famine, highlighted by recent assessments by international food security experts.

It reaffirmed the obligation of all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

Resume flow of aid
------------------

In addition to a ceasefire, the draft resolution demanded the “**immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions**” on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave.

It also urged the restoration of essential services, in accordance with humanitarian principles and prior [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 resolutions.

The text voiced support for ongoing mediation efforts led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to revive the phased ceasefire framework outlined in resolution 2735 (2024), which envisions a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of all remains, full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and the start of a long-term reconstruction plan.

Draft resolution unacceptable: United States
--------------------------------------------

Speaking ahead of the vote, acting US Representative Dorothy Shea described the draft resolution as “unacceptable”.  

“US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise – it is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,” she said.

“The United States has been clear,” she continued, “we would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza.”

She added that Hamas has rejected numerous ceasefire proposals, including one over the weekend that would have provided a pathway to end the conflict and release the remaining hostages.

“We cannot allow the Security Council to award Hamas’ intransigence,” Ms. As Secretary \[Marco\] Rubio has said: ‘If an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire’.” 

‘The world is watching’
-----------------------

The failure of the resolution comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with UN agencies warning of the total collapse of health services, growing displacement, and a rising death toll around the new privatized US-Israel led aid distribution system which bypasses established agencies.

“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said UN relief chief Tom Fletcher earlier on Wednesday.

Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding.
    
    Nick Schifrin is in New York now and joins us with more.
    
    So, Nick, what's in this proposal and could it be accepted by both sides?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Well, Geoff, as you said, Israel has accepted this proposal, which would be a 60-day cease-fire of the war in Gaza. We call on President Trump to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    There are American and Israeli officials, Geoff, who do believe and tell me that if President Trump were to publicly pressure Netanyahu to end the war, Netanyahu would agree.
    
    But, for now, until Hamas agrees to this draft we have been talking about or Israel changes its policy and agrees to end the war in full, the war goes on.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Nick Schifrin in New York tonight.
    
    Nick, thank you for that reporting.

Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding. Hamas would also return the bodies of 18 dead Israeli hostages.
    
    In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian detainees, including more than 100 serving life sentences. But so long as the war continues, Israel's military vows to take over 75 percent of Gaza, pushing Gazans into small areas in the south, what Israel, Geoff, calls sterile zones.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    And how is Israel responding to the cease-fire proposal?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    As we have discussed multiple times, Geoff, Israeli society is split. You see there some scuffled with police last night after they broke into the ruling Likud headquarters.
    
    And thousands of Israelis continue to fill Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to listen to hostage families argue that diplomacy is the only way forward. They may contain errors._

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Today, Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. But this would not, as you said, end the war or require Israel to withdraw from Gaza."

The US has blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel.

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza "must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released".

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document "abandoned" the necessity for there to be "a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages".

Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it "deeply regretted" the move.

The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected.

This group proposed the draft resolution which also "rejected any effort to starve Palestinians".

The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were "facing diminishing conditions for survival" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because [virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo)
.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a "dangerous message" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that "there's no need to come back to the negotiating table".

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution "was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed".

"Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto," he added.

Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being "directly responsible" for Israel's "genocidal war" in Gaza.

Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: "Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"

France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages.

But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors.

Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of "once again" using its veto power "to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza".

Israel rejects the accusations.

The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. [Photo Credit: Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP]")The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by Israeli forces is a reoccurring issue in the weekly field reports gathered by Al-Haq. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers. More about MEE can be found [here](https://middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye)

As Arian’s condition worsened, the soldiers did little to help. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house. It dragged me down the corridor, and I could feel pieces of my flesh falling as it bit into me."

With the help of her neighbour, the pregnant Palestinian woman managed to stand and make her way to the couch outside.

The soldier returned and pointed at her belly, asking, "What is this?" Arian answered, "Pregnancy."  

The soldier seemed confused and asked, "What does that mean?" She replied, "A baby." He asked again, "What baby?" Arian then lifted her prayer dress to show him her belly.  

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn."

Investigators believe the dogs belong to someone on Wayside Drive. No word on her condition at this time.

Wayside Drive is in the Dellview neighborhood, where we've reported numerous dog roaming incidents.
