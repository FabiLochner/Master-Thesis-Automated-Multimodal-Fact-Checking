Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-21/baby-pulled-from-rubble-gaza-after-air-strike-killed-her-family/105080278): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on March 21, 2025, reports on the rescue of a baby, Ella Osama Abu Dagga, from the rubble of a collapsed building in Khan Younis following an Israeli airstrike. The airstrike killed her parents, brother, and another family. <image:12366> shows a baby wrapped in a blanket in an ambulance. The article also includes images of the baby after being rescued and rescuers clearing the rubble. The article states that the war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because, while there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's origin or the specific event it depicts. The search results mention events in 2025, but the claim refers to July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
