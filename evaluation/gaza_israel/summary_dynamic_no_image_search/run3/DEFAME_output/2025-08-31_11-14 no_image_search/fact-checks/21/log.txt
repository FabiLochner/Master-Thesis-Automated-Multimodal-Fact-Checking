The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The claim is inaccurate. While Donald Trump halted UNRWA funding, the date specified in the claim (January 20, 2025) is not supported by the evidence. According to sources like [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100) and The Hindu, the order was issued in February 2025.
