## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR published an article on November 5, 2024, stating that Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replaced him with Israel Katz. The article also mentions that Netanyahu and Gallant have been at odds over the war in Gaza and that Gallant's dismissal sparked protests across Israel. ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) ![image 12035](media/2025-08-31_11-44-1756640651-071756.jpg), ![image 12036](media/2025-08-31_11-44-1756640651-329793.jpg)

The Times of Israel published an article about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, which included a photo of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The article also mentions damage to civilian structures and Israelis taking cover during the attack. ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) ![image 12039](media/2025-08-31_11-44-1756640662-627368.jpg), ![image 12040](media/2025-08-31_11-44-1756640663-274447.jpg), ![image 12041](media/2025-08-31_11-44-1756640663-585303.jpg) Al Jazeera published an article on October 8, 2024, stating that Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant canceled a meeting with the US Secretary of Defense. The article mentions an Iranian missile attack on Israel last week and that Gallant was fired in 2023 by Netanyahu. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-cancels-pentagon-visit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-cancels-pentagon-visit)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Yoav Gallant was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, as he was mentioned in an article about the attack ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)). Furthermore, an article from October 8, 2024, mentions Gallant canceling a meeting, indicating he was alive at that time ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-cancels-pentagon-visit](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-cancels-pentagon-visit)).

However, the Al Jazeera article also states that Gallant was fired in 2023, which contradicts the NPR article stating that he was fired on November 5, 2024 ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)). This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy of the information provided by Al Jazeera.

Based on the available evidence, the claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources indicate that Yoav Gallant was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. He was mentioned in articles about the attack and was even reported to have canceled a meeting after the attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including The Times of Israel and Al Jazeera, indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024. He was mentioned in articles about the attack and was reported to have canceled a meeting after the attack.
