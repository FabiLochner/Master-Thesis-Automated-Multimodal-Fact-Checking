## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 7, 2024, Donald Trump was interviewed by Hugh Hewitt. During the interview, Trump stated that he had been to Gaza. However, according to The Media Line, Trump misstated a Gaza visit in the interview, and The New York Times reported that there is no record of Trump ever visiting Gaza. Trump visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017, but not Gaza. ![image 332](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846018-131545.jpg), ![image 333](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846018-456021.jpg), <image:k>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, that he had been to Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that this statement is false. The New York Times reported that there is no record of Trump ever visiting Gaza, and The Media Line stated that Trump misstated a Gaza visit in the interview.


## Final Judgement
The claim is that Donald Trump stated he had been to Gaza in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024. While the interview did take place and Trump did make the statement, multiple sources, including The New York Times and The Media Line, confirm that Trump has never visited Gaza. Therefore, the claim is factually inaccurate.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, that he had been to Gaza. However, according to reporting by both The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-gaza-israel.html)) and The Media Line ([Source](https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/ex-president-trump-misstates-gaza-visit-in-hugh-hewitt-interview/)), there is no record of Trump ever visiting Gaza, making his statement false.
