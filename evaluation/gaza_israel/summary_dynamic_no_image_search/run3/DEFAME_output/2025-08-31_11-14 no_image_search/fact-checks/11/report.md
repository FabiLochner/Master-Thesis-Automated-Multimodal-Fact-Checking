## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The Jerusalem Post reported that rumors of Halevi's death were circulating on social media, but Newsweek reported that Halevi spoke at the base hit by a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024. Additionally, France 24 reported that a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, killed four Israeli soldiers at a military base.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post, Newsweek, and France 24, contradicts the claim. While rumors of Halevi's death circulated, he was reported to have spoken at the site of the drone attack. Furthermore, the attack resulted in the death of four Israeli soldiers, not Halevi.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

While rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death circulated after a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443), Halevi was later reported to have spoken at the site of the attack, according to [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/hezbollah-drone-attack-kills-israeli-soldiers-we-are-war-1968434). Furthermore, the attack resulted in the death of four Israeli soldiers, as reported by [France 24](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20241016-could-hezbollah-s-drones-change-the-course-of-the-middle-east-conflict).
