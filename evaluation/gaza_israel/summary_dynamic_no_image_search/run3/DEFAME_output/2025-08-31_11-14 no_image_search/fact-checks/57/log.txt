Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/palestine-at-least-219-journalists-and-media-workers-killed-in-gaza): 
Content: The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) reports that at least 219 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza as of August 26, 2025. The report lists numerous journalists killed in Israeli airstrikes and other attacks, including Ibrahim Muhareb, who was killed due to Israeli gunfire and shelling in western Khan Yunis on August 18, 2025. The IFJ calls for an immediate investigation into their deaths. <image:5386> <image:5389>

The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Israeli airstrikes in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City in April 2025 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike)), there is no information to confirm the identity of the baby in the image, Sham Imad Muhareb, or the nature of her injuries.

So, the overall veracity is: false
