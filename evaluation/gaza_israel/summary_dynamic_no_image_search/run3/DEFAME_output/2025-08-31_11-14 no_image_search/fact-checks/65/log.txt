Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on May 7, 2025, reports on Israeli attacks in Gaza, including an attack on a school in the Bureij refugee camp, which resulted in the recovery of four bodies from the rubble. <image:39> The article also mentions an attack on a tent shelter in Deir el-Balah, which resulted in three deaths.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/world/middleeast/israel-strike-gaza-clinic.html): 
Content: The New York Times reports on an Israeli airstrike in Deir al-Balah that killed more than a dozen people near a health clinic run by an American aid group. The strike occurred in March, after a cease-fire collapsed. The Gaza health ministry reported that more than 55,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. The article includes a CCTV video of the strike.

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, as indicated by a reverse image search ([Source](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)). While there were attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, the image does not depict this event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
