## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 25, 2024, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, according to multiple sources. One article from CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago)) mentions Trump posted about a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago on July 26, 2024, <image:k>. Another article from Voice of America ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html)) reports that Trump condemned pro-Hamas protests, ![image 5352](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913004-996719.jpg).

The Tennessee Lookout ([Source](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)) also reported on Trump's Truth Social posts, mentioning his welcome to Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, ![image 5354](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913008-261964.jpg), ![image 5357](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913017-893899.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, the provided sources do not contain the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim. The articles mention Trump's posts about a meeting with Netanyahu and his condemnation of pro-Hamas protests.

Therefore, the veracity of the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel" cannot be verified with the available evidence. Additional information is needed to confirm whether Trump made this statement.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](http://afactp.org/index-628.html): 
Content: The search result from Politifact includes several fact-checks related to Israel and Donald Trump. One fact-check from October 15, 2024, states that an Instagram post claimed Trump posted on Truth Social, "I hope that America obliterates Israel." <image:k>. The search result also contains articles about Trump's positions on Israel and Gaza, and his posts on Truth Social.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that a similar claim, "I hope that America obliterates Israel," was made in an Instagram post. However, the evidence does not confirm that Donald Trump posted this exact statement on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. The Politifact fact-check from October 15, 2024, refers to an Instagram post, not a Truth Social post from July 25, 2024.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified. The evidence suggests a similar statement was made on a different platform and at a different time.

The website trumpstruth.org ([https://trumpstruth.org/](https://trumpstruth.org/)) archives Donald Trump's Truth Social posts, but does not contain posts from July 25, 2024.

Additionally, a FOX News "Special Report With Bret Baier" from July 25, 2024 ([https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20240725_220000_Special_Report_With_Bret_Baier](https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20240725_220000_Special_Report_With_Bret_Baier)) discusses Trump's meeting with Netanyahu, his reaction to anti-Israel protests, and an attempted assassination of Trump, <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024. However, the search results of Trump's Truth Social posts do not contain the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel."

The FOX News "Special Report With Bret Baier" from July 25, 2024, discusses Trump's meeting with Netanyahu and his reaction to anti-Israel protests, but it does not include the quote in question. The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024, the specific quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel" cannot be found in any of the provided sources. The search results confirm Trump's posts on that date, but they do not contain the statement in question.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, "I hope that America obliterates Israel" is not supported by the evidence. While Trump did post on Truth Social on that date, as confirmed by sources like CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago)) and the Tennessee Lookout ([Source](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/)), the specific quote is not found in any of the provided search results, including archives of his posts and news reports about his activities on that day.
