### Evidence from `web_search`
Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024, which was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities. The article includes a photo of Tomer Bar (![image 10238](media/2025-08-30_07-04-1756537446-134571.jpg)). CUFI discusses a drone strike and mentions that Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar conducted a personal inspection of the Golani Training Base site (![image 10283](media/2025-08-30_07-04-1756537469-666838.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hеzbollаh in a drone attack in Tel Aviv in November 2024 is false. Multiple sources, including a fact-check from aol.com and Inshorts, confirm that Tomer Bar is alive and that there is no evidence to support the claim.

While there was a drone attack, the evidence indicates that Tomer Bar survived the attack.

### Verdict: FALSE
