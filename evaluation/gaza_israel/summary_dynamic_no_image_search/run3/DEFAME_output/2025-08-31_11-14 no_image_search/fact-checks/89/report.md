## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024. There are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track his location through spyware. The Israeli Defense Minister admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp. It only mentions the possibility of WhatsApp being used to track his location.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm that Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Jerusalem Post reports that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, mentioning the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran (<image:k>). The Times of Israel discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024, and the extent of Israeli intelligence penetration in Iran (![image 12312](media/2025-08-31_12-19-1756642760-497211.jpg)

## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders, specifically mentioning the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The Times of Israel also discussed the assassination and the extent of Israeli intelligence penetration in Iran.

This new information strengthens the possibility that Israeli intelligence could have used cell phone tracking, potentially including WhatsApp, to track Haniyeh. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that WhatsApp was used.

Therefore, the claim is still partially supported, but not fully verified. The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have used cell phone tracking, but the specific method (WhatsApp) remains unconfirmed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reported in March 2025 on the Israeli military's use of AI for surveillance, mentioning Unit 8200 and its analysis of intercepted communications, and that the author can be contacted via WhatsApp (![image 12315](media/2025-08-31_12-21-1756642863-756346.jpg), ![image 12316](media/2025-08-31_12-21-1756642864-000876.jpg)). Al Jazeera reported in January 2025 that WhatsApp users were targeted by Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions (<image:k>). Wikipedia states that Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group, can read text messages, track locations, and access device features, and was used to intercept WhatsApp communications.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence has the capability to track individuals through various methods, including the use of AI for surveillance and spyware. The Guardian article mentions Unit 8200 and its analysis of intercepted communications. Al Jazeera reported that WhatsApp users were targeted by Israeli spyware. Wikipedia states that Pegasus, developed by an Israeli company, can intercept WhatsApp communications.

While the evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence has the means to track individuals via WhatsApp, it does not explicitly confirm that they used WhatsApp to track Ismail Haniyeh.

Therefore, the claim remains partially supported but not fully verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence has the capability to track individuals through various methods, including the use of AI for surveillance and spyware, and that WhatsApp users have been targeted by Israeli spyware. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. Therefore, the claim is not fully verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not fully verified. While evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence has the capability to track individuals using methods that could include WhatsApp, such as AI surveillance and spyware, there is no direct confirmation that they used WhatsApp to track Ismail Haniyeh. Reports indicate that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination, and there are unconfirmed reports of WhatsApp potentially being used for tracking, but the specific method used by Israeli intelligence remains unconfirmed.
