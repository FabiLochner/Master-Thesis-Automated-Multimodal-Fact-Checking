### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, also known as "Operation True Promise II" (<image:i>, <image:k>). The attack prompted a response from Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Iran "will pay" for it. The Security Cabinet of Israel convened in a bunker in Jerusalem during the attacks.

NPR reported that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentioned an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon (![image 281](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-334464.jpg), ![image 282](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-506528.jpg)). Al Jazeera also reported on the attack, noting it was in response to Israeli actions.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024. During this attack, Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a response and convened the Security Cabinet in a bunker in Jerusalem. The provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The search results also show that Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland was discussed in January 2025, related to the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. However, this information does not support the claim that he fled to Poland during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, the claim is not supported.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, during which Netanyahu remained in Israel and convened the Security Cabinet. While there are reports about Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland in January 2025, these reports do not support the claim that he fled to Poland during the October 1, 2024, attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, during which Netanyahu remained in Israel and convened the Security Cabinet, as reported by sources like [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next). There is no evidence to support the claim that he left Israel and fled to Poland on that date.
