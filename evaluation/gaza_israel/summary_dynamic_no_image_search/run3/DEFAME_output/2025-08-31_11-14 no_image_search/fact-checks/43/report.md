## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html): 
Content: The Yahoo article fact-checks the quote "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine." attributed to Anthony Bourdain. The article states that it has been unable to find any credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement. The oldest version of the quote found with Bourdain's name attached was from July 2021. The article also mentions similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, suggesting the quote was misattributed. The article includes a photo of Anthony Bourdain ![image 12056](media/2025-08-31_11-50-1756641046-385240.jpg). The article also mentions Bourdain's visit to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for a CNN show episode.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the claim is likely false. A fact-check article found no credible record of Anthony Bourdain making the statement. The earliest attribution of the quote to Bourdain was from July 2021, and similar statements existed before that without his name attached, indicating a possible misattribution.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Anthony Bourdain said the quote is likely false. The fact-check found no credible record of Bourdain making the statement, and the quote's attribution to him appears to be recent.

`false`
