Useful result: From [Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/): 
Content: The Armenian Weekly published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel in Syria. The article mentions that Turkey and Israel are the leading external powers influencing territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria. It also states that Turkish military forces intervened in northern Syria in March 2025. <image:k>

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence does not support the claim. While Turkish President Erdogan made statements against Israel and discussed Syria with the U.S. in March 2025, there is no evidence to suggest that he urged the U.S. to control Israel. The search results from [JINSA](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/12/erdogan-lambasts-israel-for-undermining-stability-in-syria), and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/) do not provide any information about Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
