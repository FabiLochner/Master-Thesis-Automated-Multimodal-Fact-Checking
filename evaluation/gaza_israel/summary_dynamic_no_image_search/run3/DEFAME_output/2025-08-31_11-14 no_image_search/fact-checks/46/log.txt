The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: There is no evidence to support the claim that U2 and Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army in November 2024. While they have collaborated on projects, and a November 2024 article from Dublin Live ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)) criticizes them for their silence on the situation in Gaza, there is no mention of such a tour.

So, the overall veracity is: false
