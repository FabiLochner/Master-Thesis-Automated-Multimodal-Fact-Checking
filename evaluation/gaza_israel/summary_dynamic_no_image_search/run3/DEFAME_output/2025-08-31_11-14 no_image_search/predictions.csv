"," NewsMeter found that the claim is false. A keyword search led us to a report by BBC titled, ‘Netanyahu says he is undeterred after reported drone attack on his home’, dated October 20, 2024. According to the report, a drone was used to target the Israeli PM’s private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present, and no injuries were reported. Further, we found another report by the Times of Israel titled: ‘Israel vows Iran will ‘pay’ for Hezbollah attack on Netanyahu home; Tehran distances itself’, dated October 20, 2024. No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false."

96,"<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.",True,False,False,"The claim is supported by an article from Countercurrents.org, which states that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, along with their mother and grandmother [Source](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/). However, the exact date of the event is inconsistent across the sources.
"," Israel Killed the Two Siblings in October 2023, Not in July 2024. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the two Hamida children were not killed in a recent Israeli airstrike targeting Al-Jaouni school on July 6. Misbar's investigation team conducted searches using the names of the children and found earlier reports indicating that the children were killed in an Israeli assault on October 22, 2023. A Palestinian media agency published a photo of Mayar Hamida, reporting that she was killed along with her brother Bilal and their mother after Israel bombed their house in the Gaza Strip. The agency stated that they were killed on October 22, 2023. Misbar’s investigative team also found a published photo from October 22, 2023, showing a tweet from a friend of Nidal Hamida, the father of the two siblings. In the photo, Nidal Hamida is seen sitting in front of the bodies of his wife Fatima, his son Bilal, and his daughter Mayar, who were killed in their home while he was working as a news producer for the Palestine Today channel, according to the post’s description.

97,The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.,False,False,True,"The fact-check, based on multiple web searches, found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The search results focused on the US's involvement in the conflict, including military aid and diplomatic efforts, but did not mention the reinstitution of the draft. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.
"," The U.S. is not conscripting Americans into the military for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft."
98,<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. While Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel, the image of him wearing the Israeli flag is likely fabricated, as indicated by fact-checking articles from sources like [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/).
"," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "
99,<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. While there are reports of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html), [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)), the image is likely a digital artwork or a staged photograph, and the provided evidence does not confirm its authenticity or the specific details of the claim.
"," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
