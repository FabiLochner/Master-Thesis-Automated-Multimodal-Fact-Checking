‘A stern message’: how return of Trump loomed over Gaza ceasefire negotiations
==============================================================================

This article is more than 7 months old

US president-elect demanded a deal – while success against Iran and Hezbollah gave Israeli PM room to make one

The phone call from Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steven Witkoff, surprised the aides of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Calling from Doha in Qatar last Friday evening, after _Shabbat_ had already begun, Witkoff announced he was coming to Israel and would meet Netanyahu. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in July 2024. “The pressure is the essence of the matter.”

While Netanyahu has historically been able to use the threat of White House pressure as a public get out of jail free card, it is not clear – with all the risks inherent in the deal for him – that it is the case this time.

----------- Over the weekend, and into this week, the incumbent US president, Joe Biden, his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and senior figures from Egypt, Turkey and the Gulf – all mediators in the long-running negotiations – were working to put pressure on Israel and Hamas to bring the talks to a conclusion.

On Monday, Turkey’s intelligence chief, İbrahim Kalin, spoke to members of Hamas’s political bureau to apply Ankara’s own pressure.

Issues that had been sticking points for months, not least for Netanyahu, who had earlier in the year retreated from a deal he himself had promoted, suddenly were up for negotiation.

Despite the rising optimism that the sides were fast closing in on an agreement, the days since Witkoff’s meeting with Netanyahu were marked by a series of crises over the granular detail, including claims of manoeuvres until the final hours, and contradictory messaging.

By Wednesday afternoon, however, the indications were fast aligning that a deal was imminent, as Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced he was flying back to Israel from a foreign trip to be available for a vote on the deal.

Trump himself scrambled to take credit on Truth Social on Wednesday.

“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signalled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,” he wrote.

“I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.”

The deal is thought to comprise a three-phase agreement – based on the framework originally laid out by Biden and endorsed by the UN security council with Netanyahu’s own buy-in (quickly reversed) in 2024.

It stipulates the release of 33 hostages over a six-week period, including women, children, older adults and wounded civilians, in exchange for potentially hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel.

Among the 33 would be five female Israeli soldiers, each of whom would be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners, including 30 convicted militants serving life sentences. He had other fish to fry.

“What happened,” a senior Israeli government official told Channel 14, regarded as a mouthpiece for Netanyahu, “is that Witkoff delivered a stern message from the incoming president of the United States, who unequivocally demanded the deal’s conclusion.”

Writing in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth this week, Nadav Eyal summed up the situation confronting Israel’s prime minister and his closest aides. For Netanyahu, who swore to fight until a “total” – if ill-defined and unattainable – victory, the promised release of living hostages and bodies in the so-called humanitarian category of women, children and the ill brings him closer to the widely held view of most Israelis that a hostage deal should be a priority.

For Hamas, Israel’s concessions on quitting buffer zones such as the Netzarim corridor and agreeing to the return of civilians to Gaza’s north – albeit after they are screened – is closer to their own maximalist position that a comprehensive deal is possible only with the end of fighting and the withdrawal of Israel’s forces. In between, however, remain a multitude of grey areas and unresolved questions.

Given the shape of the deal, one of the most pressing questions for Netanyahu is why he did not accept a similar agreement on offer as far back as May 2024.

The willingness of Netanyahu to deal at the last moment under pressure from Trump – defying far-right members of his coalition including Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich – has not been lost on Israeli commentators.

“I ask myself where did all the obstacles go?” wrote Ben Caspit in the Hebrew daily Ma’ariv. All of the obstacles that emerged at decisive moments in the negotiations, all of the statements that were issued, including several that were issued during the Sabbath, about how Israel would never leave, never stop, never surrender and never give in?”

While Netanyahu has faced a pincer movement from the incoming and outgoing US presidents, he has also seen a change in his own political circumstances that has opened the way for more flexibility.

The relative success of Israel in its war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and more widely against Iran’s “axis of resistance” – even if it has not seen the anticipated return of many Israelis to the country’s north from where they have been displaced – has offered a measure of respite to be talked up.

The hard arithmetic of Netanyahu’s right-far-right coalition has also altered, not least with the return of former Likud party rival Gideon Sa’ar and his faction in September, undermining the influence of Ben Gvir and the far right.

Ben Gvir himself appeared to accept the inevitable, boasting to his constituency on X that his party had blocked a deal from being done on numerous previous occasions.

All of this has made life complicated for the Netanyahu proxies who have previously talked up the Israeli prime minister’s resolve and how friendly Trump would be to Israel.

“The pressure Trump is exerting right now is not the kind that Israel expected from him,” lamented the rightwing commentator Jacob Bardugo on Channel 14 on Monday."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President-elect Donald Trump.

CNN  — 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that he had a “very warm” phone call with US President-elect Donald Trump, during which they spoke about the need for Israel’s victory in its [war on Hamas](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel)
 in Gaza and its stance on Syria.

In a video statement, Israel’s leader said he discussed a range of issues with Trump during the call on Saturday evening, including Israel’s commitment to preventing Lebanon-based Hezbollah from rearming and Israel’s conflict with Hamas, which has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza strip.

The leaders also spoke of the need to bring home the remaining hostages in Gaza, Netanyahu said.

“I discussed all of this again last night with my friend, US President-elect Donald Trump,” Netanyahu said.

“It was a very friendly, very warm and very important conversation. And I add, the less we talk about it, the better, and so with God’s help, we will succeed.”

CNN has reached out to the Trump transition team for comment.

‘No interest in confronting’ Syria
----------------------------------

Regarding Syria, where a rebel coalition overthrew the regime of President Bashar al-Assad last weekend following a lightning advance through the country, Netanyahu said that Israel had “no interest in a conflict” the country, but would adjust its policy according to the “emerging reality on the ground.”

His latest comments come after Israeli forces following Assad’s fall took control of a long-standing [buffer zone](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/14/world/israel-syria-golan-mount-hermon-intl/index.html)
 that had separated Israeli and Syrian forces for decades – a move the rebels now in charge of Syria and some of the country’s neighbors have criticized.

Israeli officials have said the measure is temporary and Netanyahu has previously insisted Israel has “no intention” of intervening in Syria’s internal affairs.

[![The Israeli Embassy on Shelbourne Road in Dublin, as Israel has said it will close its Dublin embassy, accusing Ireland of "crossing every red line".

The Israeli Embassy on Shelbourne Road in Dublin, as Israel has said it will close its Dublin embassy, accusing Ireland of "crossing every red line". Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981.

Since the fall of Assad last week, the Israeli military has also taken control of Mount Hermon, which abuts the Golan Heights and lies within the buffer zone that had previously separated the two sides’ troops.

Despite Israel’s insistence the move is temporary, several Arab states have accused Israel of exploiting instability in Syria to execute a land grab, while the rebel coalition now in charge of Syria has accused it of “crossing the lines of engagement.”

Adding to those tensions, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a plan by Netanyahu to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office.

“In light of the war and the new front against Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan Heights, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today submitted for government approval the first amendment to the plan to encourage demographic growth in the Golan Heights and Katzrin Heights,” the statement said. Katzrin is an Israeli settlement in the Golan.

The plan “will assist the Golan Regional Council in absorbing the new residents who will arrive,” the statement added.

“Strengthening the Golan Heights is strengthening the state of Israel, and it is especially important at this time. We will continue to hold on to it, make it flourish, and settle it,” Netanyahu said, according to the statement.

The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration in 2019. We spoke about the need to complete Israel’s victory, and we also spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages.”

Hamas and other groups are believed to still be holding 100 hostages in Gaza, including seven Americans. All but four of the hostages were captured during Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Netanyahu said that Israel continues to “work tirelessly to bring our hostages home, both the living and the dead. Picture date: Sunday December 15, 2024.\

However, in his statement Sunday, the Israeli leader noted that Syria had “allowed Iran to arm Hezbollah through its territory” and said Israel was committed to preventing the militant group from rearming.

“This is an ongoing test for Israel, we must meet it – and we will meet it. I say to Hezbollah and Iran in no uncertain terms – to prevent you from harming us, we will continue to act against you as much as necessary, in every arena and at any time,” he said.

Israel reached a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in November after a 13-month conflict largely fought along Israel’s border with Lebanon which saw Israel kill a string of high-ranking Hezbollah commanders."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, about an alleged phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a ceasefire deal, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The Guardian mentioned a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Netanyahu, but it does not specify the date or the content of the call. CNN reported a call on December 15, 2024, but it does not mention the content of the call.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

American Muckrakers, a super political-action committee in the US, has asked the Department of Justice and the Department of State to investigate reports that Trump was lobbying Netanyahu and influencing US efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza, Al Jazeera reported. 

The super PAC cited a report by Axios News on an alleged phone call between the former US president and Netanyahu on August 14 during which the pair discussed the ceasefire deal.

It also referred to remarks by PBS journalist Judy Woodruff who said on Monday that Trump was speaking to Netanyahu “urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed that would help the Harris campaign”.

said the alleged interactions violate the Logan Act, which bars unauthorized private US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.

Both Trump and Netanyahu, however, have denied reports of a phone call on August 14.

Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called on Netanyahu to put an immediate end to the war on Gaza, lamenting the civilian death toll.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, about an alleged phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a ceasefire deal, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The Guardian mentioned a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Netanyahu, but it does not specify the date or the content of the call. CNN reported a call on December 15, 2024, but it does not mention the content of the call.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to avert Gaza ceasefire deal, fearing it may help Harris in elections: Report
=============================================================================================================

Trump's alleged August 14 call with the Israeli PM coincided with the collapse of ceasefire talks on Sunday, after Hamas rejected the latest US proposal and blamed Netanyahu for changing terms.

Former US President and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is facing controversy over alleged attempts to solicit foreign influence in the upcoming elections in November.

This comes amidst a severe [humanitarian crisis in Gaza](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/18/besieged-gazans-share-shoes-wear-same-clothes-for-months)
, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed, injured, or displaced due to the ongoing Israeli bombing campaign since the war broke out on Oct 7, 2023.

According to US media reports, the former President [reportedly spoke](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)
 with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging him to reject a ceasefire deal in Gaza over concerns that it could benefit his Democratic rival and Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.

Veteran journalist and _PBS NewsHour_ host Judy Woodruff said on her show: "The reporting is that former President Trump is on the phone with the Prime Minister of Israel, urging him not to cut a deal right now, because it’s believed it would help the Harris campaign."

It is unclear whether Woodruff was referring to a new report or referencing last week's reports about Trump's alleged conversation with the Israeli PM, which coincided with the subsequent collapse of ceasefire talks on Sunday.

The collapse occurred after Hamas rejected the latest US proposal, [blaming Netanyahu](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/18/hamas-rejects-us-ceasefire-hostage-proposal)
 for altering the terms.

"After being briefed by the mediators about what happened in the last round of talks in Doha, we once again came to the conclusion that Netanyahu is still putting obstacles in the way of reaching an agreement, and is setting new conditions and demands with the aim of undermining the mediators' efforts and prolonging the war," Hamas said in a statement, according to _Axios_.

Notably, senior Israeli officials [told](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/19/netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands)
 _[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/19/netanyahu-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands)
_ that the Israeli leader had endorsed the US proposal, knowing that Hamas would reject it.

Last week, another _[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)
_ [report](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/15/trump-netanyahu-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-call)
 revealed that Trump had spoken with Netanyahu on August 14, a day before the ceasefire talks. The killing has to stop." [pic.twitter.com/fPrmGbH25J](https://t.co/fPrmGbH25J)

If confirmed, Trump's actions could potentially violate the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorised US citizens from negotiating with foreign governments to influence their actions or policies.

Meanwhile, political watchdog and investigative journalism group _American Muckrakers PAC_ [filed a request](https://x.com/AmericanMuck/status/1826089810999509462)
 with the DOJ and State Department on Tuesday to investigate Trump's potential Logan Act violation, citing news reports of his calls with the Israeli leader.

However, the application of the Logan Act has been rare and challenging, with few prosecutions or convictions historically.

The former US President and his campaign associates have a history of attempting to coerce foreign powers for electoral gains.

Russian state actors, reportedly under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, influenced the 2016 US presidential election, with four major investigations confirming these findings.

Among them, a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a bipartisan Senate report concluded that the Trump campaign [welcomed foreign assistance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/17/truth-about-russia-trump-2016-election/)
, violating established US election laws. Several individuals associated with the Trump campaign [were convicted or indicted](https://time.com/5556331/mueller-investigation-indictments-guilty-pleas/)
 in connection with the Russia investigation, led by Mueller.

And in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Trump was [caught pressuring](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49800181)
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate Joe Biden and his son while withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine, a move that ultimately led to the first of his two impeachments.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides more details about the claim. Both the Tehran Times and The New Indian Express reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, citing a phone call on August 14, 2024. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

The claim is supported by reports from multiple news sources, which state that Trump's alleged motivation was to hinder Kamala Harris' campaign. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.

The claim's veracity is **unclear** due to conflicting reports and denials from the involved parties.

([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations)) <image:11388> CNN reported that Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Donald Trump on December 15, 2024, to discuss the war on Hamas in Gaza. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/middleeast/netanyahu-trump-call-gaza-syria-intl-latam)) <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, about an alleged phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a ceasefire deal, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The Guardian mentioned a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Netanyahu, but it does not specify the date or the content of the call. CNN reported a call on December 15, 2024, but it does not mention the content of the call.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502791/Probe-called-into-Trump-Netanyahu-dealings-to-prolong-Gaza-war](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502791/Probe-called-into-Trump-Netanyahu-dealings-to-prolong-Gaza-war)) reported that American Muckrakers asked for an investigation into reports that Trump was lobbying Netanyahu to influence a Gaza ceasefire. The report cited an alleged phone call on August 14, where Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign. Both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The New Indian Express ([https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report)) also reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to reject a Gaza ceasefire deal, fearing it might help Kamala Harris in the upcoming elections, mentioning a report of a phone call on August 14, 2024, which coincided with the collapse of ceasefire talks. Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. <image:1> <image:11416> <image:11418>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides more details about the claim. Both the Tehran Times and The New Indian Express reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, citing a phone call on August 14, 2024. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

The claim is supported by reports from multiple news sources, which state that Trump's alleged motivation was to hinder Kamala Harris' campaign. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.

The claim's veracity is **unclear** due to conflicting reports and denials from the involved parties.

Erin Schaff/Pool/Reuters

CNN  — 

Vice President Kamala Harris declined to preside over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s [address to Congress](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html)
 on Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

The decision to skip the joint meeting underscores the tense relationship between the Biden administration and Netanyahu at a time when the war in Gaza has caused growing backlash from the left.

An aide to the vice president said the two world leaders will meet separately later this week. Harris’ aide cited a previously scheduled event as the reason for missing the speech Wednesday.

A date for the Netanyahu-Harris meeting has not been announced, but it will be separate from President Joe Biden’s planned meeting with the Israeli prime minister.

The closely watched bilateral will mark Harris’ first meeting with a world leader since Biden stepped aside from his reelection campaign and [endorsed Harris’ candidacy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/kamala-harris-democratic-nomination/index.html)
.

Harris is expected to “continue her intensive engagement on the conflict in Gaza,” the aide said, noting that she is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself, condemn Hamas’ attack on October 7 and reiterate concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“We anticipate the Vice President will convey her view that it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination,” according to the aide.

U.S. “And they will discuss efforts to reach agreement on the ceasefire deal.”

On Wednesday, Harris is set to address Zeta Phi Beta sorority’s Grand Boule in Indianapolis for a moderated conversation, an effort to engage Black women voters.

“Her travel to Indianapolis on July 24 should not be interpreted as a change in her position with regard to Israel,” the aide said.

Harris was not the only top Democrat to decline presiding over Netanyahu’s speech. Senate President Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, also declined to preside, according to a spokesperson.

Instead, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, will preside over Netanyahu’s address on Capitol Hill, a source familiar told CNN.

Netanyahu landed in the Washington, DC, area on Monday afternoon, according to a [post by an Israeli Embassy official on X.](https://x.com/EliavBenjamin/status/1815484694902837408)
 He is expected to meet with the families of those held hostage by Hamas in Gaza – including Americans – on Monday evening.

Netanyahu is also slated to meet with congressional leaders on Wednesday, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Biden is expected to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday, a US official said, though the date of the meeting has been fluid as the US president recovers from Covid-19. Over the weekend, Biden announced he would end his bid for reelection and has endorsed Harris to be the Democratic nominee for president.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife, are interviewed before the departure for Washington, Ben-Gurion Airport, Israel, July 22, 2024. — Amos ben Gershom/GPO

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to arrive to Washington on Monday and meet with President Joe Biden on Tuesday, a day before the Israeli leader is due to address a joint session of Congress.

After Biden announced his intention to withdraw from the presidential race and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, Netanyahu refrained from wading into US electoral politics. The Israeli prime minister who is known to favor Republican nominees said Monday he will seek the continuation of American bipartisan [support of Israel](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/biden-approaches-red-line-netanyahu-7-months-gaza-war)
 and pledged to preserve Israel’s friendship and partnership with the United States no matter who wins the next election.

Speaking with reporters before taking off for Washington, Netanyahu said he intended to reaffirm to the United States — "to our friends in both political camps" — that "regardless of who the American people choose as their next president, Israel remains its most indispensable and strongest ally in the Middle East."

**Harris to the left of Biden**

Apart from Biden, and a possible, not-yet-confirmed meeting with former President Donald Trump, Netanyahu is also set to meet with Vice President and presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

Harris is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Reuters said Monday that Harris is expected to stick largely to Biden's foreign policies, but could adopt a harsher tone with Israel over the Gaza war, if elected president.

Sidelining his disagreements with Biden, Netanyahu said that in addition to addressing Congress July 24, he is also set to meet with the American president "whom I have known for over 40 years." Netanyahu said, "This \[the meeting\] will be an opportunity to thank him for the things he did for Israel in the war and during his long and distinguished career in public service, as senator, vice president and president. In this time of war and uncertainty, it is of the outmost importance for our enemies to know that the United States and Israel are standing together — today, tomorrow and always."

Netanyahu’s visit to Washington will be his first since establishing his government in December 2022, and in fact the first in almost four years. Still, Schumer eventually joined the initiative of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to invite Netanyahu to address a joint session, making the Israeli premier one of the only world leaders to deliver his fourth speech to Congress.

The invitation letter for Netanyahu — signed by Johnson, Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — said, “To build on our enduring relationship and to highlight America’s solidarity with Israel, we invite you to share the Israeli government’s vision for defending democracy, \[combating\] terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.”

Washington police said they were expecting a large number of demonstrators outside Congress on Wednesday, protesting against Netanyahu and the [Gaza war](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/israels-netanyahu-gambles-gaza-cease-fire-new-conditions)
, and were making additional security arrangements. He said that this would mean that Netanyahu should expect a complicated meeting with the president, who will insist on reaching soon a plan for the liberation of the hostages and a Gaza cease-fire.

She and President Biden are still pushing for a cease-fire deal that sees the hostages released, the fighting in Gaza to end and so "Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self determination."

Previously, Harris had not differed far from Biden's position on Israel and Gaza since the outset of the war. 22, 2024. 22, 2024. **Justin Sullivan/Getty Images** ****hide caption****

, and endorsed [Vice President Kamala Harris](https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/kamala-harris/)
 to replace him on the ticket.

Even before [Democratic lawmakers called on the president](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/democrats-that-want-biden-drop-out-list/74448644007/)

On Oct. "It matters how."

Kamala Harris called for immediate cease-fire in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------

In March, Harris called for an "[immediate cease-fire" in Gaza](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/03/kamala-harris-immediate-ceasefire-gaza/72833162007/)
 due to the "humanitarian catastrophe." At the time, it was the most pointed call to stop the fighting from a member of the Biden administration.

 in Selma, Alabama, Harris also called for more humanitarian aid to the region.

"What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating," she said. had been working towards a cease-fire for months, and created a framework that both sides agreed to, though there were ["gaps to close."](https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/07/12/joe-biden-calls-end-israel-hamas-war-solo-news-conference/74375638007/)

The Biden administration also tried to get humanitarian aid to the region with a $230 million floating pier, which [shut down after two months](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/11/us-pier-in-gaza-closes/74366780007/)
.

Reacting to Biden ending his candidacy, [Netanyahu said](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/07/22/us-ally-reaction-biden-2024-election/74494568007/)
 he plans to use his upcoming joint address to Congress "to see President Biden, whom I've known for over 40 years. 7, [Hamas-led militants attacked Israel](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/04/05/israel-hamas-six-month-anniversary-hostages/73168211007/)
, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages back to Gaza. And our common humanity compels us to act."

She also acknowledged Israel's need to address the threat Hamas poses.

Israel's PM plans to thank Biden in Congress address this week
--------------------------------------------------------------

As Biden was facing [mounting calls to step aside](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out-what-next/74463641007/)
, he defended his record and candidacy for a second term at [NATO Summit press conference](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/12/joe-biden-flubs-nato-press-conference-the-excerpt/74379067007/)

He said the U.S. She also came close to accusing Israel of [committing war crimes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/12/08/israel-war-crimes-gaza/71731325007/)
, saying, "international humanitarian law must be respected."

===============================================

Vice President Kamala Harris is unlikely to significantly deviate from President Joe Biden’s line on Israel during the election campaign, but she could harshen the tone if elected president.

US Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Douglas Emhoff descend from Air Force Two at Delaware National Air Guard base in New Castle, Delaware, on July 22, 2024. "She will have to somewhat distance herself from Biden, but she is going to keep it very minimal," as Israel is not a key issue in the American presidential elections where immigration and inflation will dominate.

Considered to the left of President Joe Biden on the Gaza war and Israeli policy, Vice President [Kamala Harris](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/gaza-iran-what-kamala-harris-middle-east-policy-could-look)
 is expected to adopt a slightly more critical approach of Israel's military conduct when she likely becomes the Democratic nominee for president — and an even harsher approach if she wins the election, experts tell Al-Monitor. 

"We don’t know enough," Ziegler Distinguished Fellow at The Washington Institute David Makovsky, who served on the US negotiating team during the 2013-2014 Israeli-Palestinian talks, told Al-Monitor. A White House readout after the meeting said Harris "raised the need to increase stability and security in the West Bank and hold extremist settlers accountable for violent acts." The Biden administration has imposed [sanctions](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/extremist-west-bank-settlers-outposts-hit-us-sanctions)
 on several individuals and entities accused of committing violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. 

**Obama redux?**

Israeli and American experts warn it is too soon to have a clear picture on the policy Harris will espouse on Israel in general and on the Gaza war in particular, as she has not yet officially received the nomination as the Democratic Party candidate. On the other hand, she has been quite outspoken about Palestinian suffering in Gaza."

In making his assessment, Makovsky drew on the speech Harris delivered in Dubai last December, when she said that Israel "must do more to protect civilian life \[in Gaza\]." Reaffirming the Biden administration's stance that Israel had the right to defend itself against Hamas after the Gaza-based group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, Harris also expressed concerns about widespread Palestinian suffering and warned that "international humanitarian law must be respected."

Contrary to high-ranking members of the Biden foreign policy and defense team, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Biden himself, among others, Harris has not traveled to Israel since Oct. While Biden has had dealings with Netanyahu for four decades and touts their close relationship despite its obvious souring in recent months, Harris has met the Israeli premier only a handful of times. 

**Harris on the Gaza war**

Addressing the Munich Security Conference in February, Harris said that Hamas had used rape of Israeli women as a weapon of war, but she added that "we have also been clear that far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, that Israel must do better to protect innocent civilians." On that occasion, Harris also called on Israelis and Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table, noting that "there cannot be, in my opinion, peace and security for that region — for the people of Israel or the Palestinians and the people of Gaza — without a two-state solution."

Harris’ call to protect the lives of Gaza civilians did not markedly differ from statements made by Biden. Still, contrary to Biden, in a July 8 interview with The Nation, Harris went into greater detail on the suffering of Gazans. I’m hearing stories about their eating animal feed, grass … so that’s how I think about it," The Nation quoted Harris as saying. 

Meanwhile, Harris' aides indicated Monday that the vice president will not preside over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday due to previously planned travel. Harris referred to the issue of West Bank settlement and extremist settlers in her meeting in Washington last November with Israeli President Isaac Herzog."

FACT CHECK: Did Kamala Harris Say 'Our Support for Israel Will Continue?'
=========================================================================

As of now no evidence has been found of Harris using those words during Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   By [R. She was scheduled to meet with Netanyahu separately on July 25, 2024.

According to an anonymous aide quoted by The Wall Street Journal, Harris was expected to urge Netanyahu to end the conflict in a manner that ensures Israel's security, guarantees the release of all hostages, alleviates the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and allows the Palestinian people to attain their rights to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.

Although she has been vocally supportive of Israel, Harris was the first in the Biden administration to advocate for a temporary cease-fire in a speech given in March 2024. According to a post on X, Harris allegedly reinforced her ties with Israel by saying, "Our support for Israel will continue."

The post garnered over 9 million views and was shared more than 4,000 times. Ghosh](/reporters/r-ghosh)

Earlier this week, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the United States during Israel's ongoing bombardment of Gaza, a supposed quote from Vice President Kamala Harris gained widespread attention. She did not attend Netanyahu's address to Congress on July 24, 2024, due to other commitments, although she planned to meet with him during his visit.

However, Harris has supported Israel during its military operations in Gaza, while also advocating for a cease-fire and increased humanitarian aid. She also emphasized the need for increased humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Amid uncertainty regarding her position on Israel, Doug Emhoff, Harris' husband, participated in a Zoom call on July 24 organized by the Jewish Democratic Council of America and Jewish Women for Kamala. She has consistently supported Israel during its assault on Gaza and also became the first person in the Biden administration to call for a temporary cease-fire but the claim made in the viral post is completely false.

**No Concrete Evidence**

Kamala Harris Twitter

As of now no evidence has been found of Harris using those words during Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months. Therefore, this claim can be rated "False."

The latest statement Harris made regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict condemned pro-Palestine protesters in Washington, D.C., for burning American flags.

On July 24, 2024, many demonstrators gathered to criticize Netanyahu after his congressional speech and to call for an end to the war in Gaza, where Israeli military operations have killed over 39,000 Palestinians.

Harris' statement read: "I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. President Joe Biden has been vocally pro-Israel even before the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, many analysts suggest that Harris may be shifting her stance over time.

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations of targeting civilians, saying it abides by international law and has a right to defend itself after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Some 83% of Gaza’s population are residing in the Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone,” according to IDF assessments in July.

The zone is located in the al-Mawasi area on the southern Strip’s coast, western neighborhoods of Khan Younis, and central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah. Israel says it has killed some 18,000 combatants in battle as of November, 2024, and another 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.

According to the PCBS, the population of Gaza has declined by about 160,000 during the course of the war to 2.1 million, with more than a million or 47% of the total under the age of 18. The data presented by the body this week claimed that there were approximately 60,000 pregnant women currently in the Strip, which would mean an increase in births despite the overall decline in population and ongoing grueling war.

The PCBS said some 22% of Gaza’s population currently faces catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, according to the criteria of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global monitor.

Included in that 22% are some 3,500 children at risk of death due to malnutrition and lack of food, the bureau said.

It added that Israel has “raged a brutal aggression against Gaza targeting all kinds of life there; humans, buildings and vital infrastructure… entire families were erased from the civil register. (Omar AL-QATTAA / AFP)

The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Around 45,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, have been killed since the war began and another 11,000 are missing, the bureau said, citing numbers from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.

The Hamas figures cannot be verified and do not differentiate between civilians and fighters. <image:11497>

Six percent of the prewar population figure cited by PCBS would indicate a decline of approximately 126,000 people."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information. One source, an article by the NYCFPA, claims a 2.02% increase in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. However, CNN and The Times of Israel report a 6% *decrease* in Gaza's population since the war began on the same date, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS).

The discrepancy could be due to different methodologies, data sources, or the time frame considered. The NYCFPA article's reliance on pre-war growth forecasts might not account for the impact of the conflict. The CNN and Times of Israel reports, citing the PCBS, appear to reflect actual population changes during the war, including migration and casualties.

Therefore, the claim is likely false, as the more recent reports indicate a population decrease, not an increase.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing. For comparison, the UN previously [reported](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm22010.doc.htm)

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)
 as the United States seeks to move forward with long-stalled negotiations to bring back the hostages and end the war in Gaza in the wake of Yahya Sinwar’s death.

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)

Philippe Lazzarini speaks during an interview in New York on September 24.

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

  !People inspect the damage at the site of an overnight Israeli airstrike that targeted a branch of the Al-Qard Al-Hassan finance group in Beirut's southern suburbs on Monday. <image:11584>](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/1233941853/israel-hezbollah-beirut-lebanon-explosion-hassan-nasrallah)

### [What is Hezbollah, the militia fighting Israel in Lebanon?](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/1233941853/israel-hezbollah-beirut-lebanon-explosion-hassan-nasrallah)

A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to detail attack plans before they were carried out, on Sunday told reporters that Israel planned the strikes throughout Lebanon against several of the institution's branches that act like banks to help fund Hezbollah — what the official termed the organization's "economic strongholds."

But the official also acknowledged that while Al-Qard Al-Hassan is used in part to pay Hezbollah fighters and purchase weapons, it has also served hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians — the majority drawn from the country's Shia Muslim communities — who simply used the system for their own banking needs. Lebanon is assessing the damage.

Late Sunday an Israeli military spokesperson published messages online in Arabic instructing Lebanese civilians to move away from specific buildings that house branches of the bank, called Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

While United Nations representatives said the warnings sparked panic in parts of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, Israel's foreign minister [said 15 buildings](https://x.com/Israel_katz/status/1848239028304240663)
 were struck and its military would continue to attack Hezbollah.

The U.S. And in the city of Tyre, the agency reported that "severe damage to surrounding homes" and to a nearby radio station had resulted from the strike on one branch.

Across Lebanon on Saturday, the country's Health Ministry recorded 16 people killed and 59 wounded people, many of them in the country's south close to Israel's border — bringing the total death toll since the start of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah last October to 2,464.

In northern Israel, the Israeli government's latest figures show a total of 59 people killed and 569 injured over the same period.

A drone that the Iranian state news agency says Hezbollah sent from Lebanon had targeted the family residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the northern city of Caesarea, according to the prime minister's office. **\-/AFP via Getty Images** ****hide caption****

TEL AVIV, Israel, and BEIRUT — Israel's military carried out [airstrikes overnight](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)
 on targets in Lebanon that the military says are linked to a financial institution that undergirds the militant group Hezbollah. "We tell the depositors in Al-Qard Al-Hassan that you will not lose a single penny," he told local media, in an interview later shared [in part on Telegram](https://t.me/almayadeen/269486)
.

Israeli military warnings on social media before the strikes informed the residents of specific buildings in southern Beirut and the Bekaa Valley that they were "located near facilities and interests affiliated with Hezbollah." Those inside the highlighted buildings were told to evacuate immediately and remain at least 500 meters (547 yards) away from them "for your safety and the safety of your family members."

Some [Lebanese news outlets and social media posts](https://x.com/ALJADEEDNEWS/status/1848078370812170495?mx=2)
 subsequently suggested that a hospital in the town of Baalbek had been evacuated due to its proximity to a strike on one Al-Qard Al-Hassan branch. But in a [statement Lebanon's health ministry denied that](https://www.mtv.com.lb/en/News/Local/1504621/health-ministry-clarification--baalbek-governmental-hospital-transferred-patients-to-safer-rooms)
, and said the hospital was operating normally. "Hezbollah has paid and will continue to pay a heavy price for its attacks on northern Israel and its rocket fire."

Hezbollah is partially financed and significantly supported by the government of Iran, and Katz said Israeli forces would "keep striking the Iranian proxy until it collapses."

Precise details of fatalities and injuries tied to the strikes overnight into Monday have not yet been confirmed. But ahead of his arrival in the Lebanese capital, Israel's military had announced fresh ground raids in southern Lebanon, killing fighters and dismantling anti-tank missiles, RPG launchers and other explosives, according to an Israeli military statement. Two dozen missiles crossed the border from Lebanon into northern Israel Monday morning after around 200 did so on Sunday, according to the Israeli military.

.[\[94\]](#cite_note-apnews20240930-100)

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[95\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-101)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[96\]](#cite_note-aj-102)
 which quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges impacting areas in or around [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
 of [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
.[\[97\]](#cite_note-103)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[89\]](#cite_note-foreignaffairs20240923-95)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
.[\[98\]](#cite_note-Hezbollah_warns-104)

 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon,[\[101\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-107)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[102\]](#cite_note-108)

Israel requested that Hezbollah implement [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701")
 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")

 UNIFIL reports that Israel entered Lebanese airspace on more than 22,000 occasions between 2007 and 2021.[\[114\]](#cite_note-120)
[\[115\]](#cite_note-121)
 Diplomatic efforts, led by U.S. The IDF said that they were distributed without senior authorisation and that the incident was being investigated.[\[118\]](#cite_note-124)

On 17 and 18 September, thousands of Hezbollah's handheld [pagers and walkie-talkies exploded](/wiki/2024_Lebanon_electronic_device_attacks "2024 Lebanon electronic device attacks")

[\[122\]](#cite_note-ABCN_1-128)
 Reuters reported that, according to an unnamed Hezbollah official, 1,500 Hezbollah fighters were taken out of action due to injuries, with many blinded or having lost their hands.[\[123\]](#cite_note-129)
 Despite Israel denying involvement with the attack,[\[124\]](#cite_note-denial-130)
 unnamed Israeli sources told Reuters and other media that it was orchestrated by Israel's intelligence service ([Mossad](/wiki/Mossad "Mossad")
) and military.[\[125\]](#cite_note-131)
[\[126\]](#cite_note-nyt-fbs-trojan-24-132)
[\[119\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-125)
 In response, Hezbollah, who described the attack as a possible [declaration of war](/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war")
 by Israel, launched a rocket attack on northern Israel a few days later.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-133)
[\[128\]](#cite_note-134)

 said they found Hezbollah plans to launch an attack similar to Hamas' [7 October attacks](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
, which sparked the conflict.[\[86\]](#cite_note-reuters20240930-92)
 Hagari also mentioned that evidence from these operations, including videos and maps, would be presented to the international community. Two hours later, the IDF fired rounds into the camp that caused smoke to rise, injuring 15 UNIFIL peacekeepers due to skin irritations and [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract")
 reactions.[\[74\]](#cite_note-bbc20241013-79)

In recent days, residents across central Israel have reported hearing loud nighttime explosions, likely stemming from [IDF operations in Gaza](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1niijygxg)
.

Ynet received dozens of emails from residents describing what sounded like distant blasts. While the IDF has not yet commented, a physicist explained why such explosions can sometimes be heard dozens of kilometers away.

IDF strikes in Gaza

Dr. Yuval Rosenberg, a physicist at the [Davidson Institute of Science Education](https://www.ynetnews.com/topics/Davidson_Institute_of_Science)
, told Ynet that weather plays a key role in how sound travels. “When the air gets warmer closer to the ground—usually because the sun heats the surface—sound waves can bend upward, away from our ears, weakening the noise we hear,” he said.

Conversely, during the night, the ground cools faster than the air above it, reversing the effect. “This is one reason why explosions from Gaza often sound louder in central Israel at night,” Rosenberg noted.

He also explained the physics behind the sound of rocket blasts over the sea. “When a rocket explodes, it produces a shock wave with a sudden and intense air pressure change,” he said. “Close to the blast, this wave can be deadly or cause serious damage—especially in the sea, where it can harm marine life.”

As the shock wave travels, it loses energy by heating the air and interacting with objects. Eventually, it breaks apart into the sound waves we hear. “It’s like a huge wave at sea that collapses into smaller ones,” Rosenberg said.

#### TAKE ACTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

WE MUST END GENOCIDE IN GAZA
============================

Palestinians in Gaza are **facing mass starvation.** The Israeli military is blocking aid, bombing shelters, and turning food, water, and medicine into weapons of war.

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to send billions in weapons to the Israeli government — despite clear evidence they’re being used to commit war crimes.

Amnesty has repeatedly documented U.S.-made weapons in unlawful attacks on civilians. **U.S. leaders risk complicity in genocide.**

**Act now:** Tell Congress to stop arming this crisis, demand a permanent ceasefire, and help facilitate the unhindered entry and distribution of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Hello, I write to you as a member of Amnesty International USA with deep concern over the ongoing violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. I am also deeply worried about President Trump's dangerous threats to forcibly deport around 2 million Palestinians and "take over" the occupied Gaza Strip – as they are not just outrageous and shameful, but if enacted, would amount to a war crime. The U.S. government is uniquely positioned to have tremendous impact in this conflict to ensure the protection of civilians and prevent further suffering. Since the Hamas-led attacks and atrocities on October 7, we have witnessed horror unfolding on an unimaginable scale in the occupied Gaza Strip. More than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to survive amidst a human-made humanitarian catastrophe, and the level of civilian casualties has been unprecedented. Amnesty International's new research report, published on December 5 and titled 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman': Israel's Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza,' concludes that the Israeli government has committed and is continuing to commit genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Even with the ceasefire, the Israeli authorities continue to inflict conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, a prohibited act of genocide. I am urging you to immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale, or transfer to the Israeli government of all weapons, munitions, and other military and security equipment that would more likely than not be used in the violation of international humanitarian and human rights law, consistent with the United States’ own laws and its obligations under the Genocide Convention. Governments – including and especially the United States’ – that continue to transfer arms to Israel at this time must know they are violating their obligation to prevent genocide and are at risk of becoming complicit in genocide. To protect civilians, I am also urging you to ensure that the ceasefire becomes permanent and that desperately needed humanitarian aid and reconstruction is not used as a means to coerce Palestinians into leaving Gaza. Palestinians must be allowed to return to their homes and be provided dignified temporary housing until reconstruction is completed. Remaining hostages and arbitrarily detained Palestinians must also be released. Sincerely, {user\_data~First Name} {user\_data~Last Name}

The evidence supports the claim that there was an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific attack.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

An Israeli missile hits a building in Ghobeiry, Beirut. Another captured it a fragment of a second before it smashed through a lower-floor balcony.

In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outwards as the building collapsed.

The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs to evacuate the area. \[Bilal Hussein/AP Photo\]

Published On 23 Oct 202423 Oct 2024

Taking cover behind a large tree, a photographer from The Associated Press news agency pointed his camera towards an apartment building in Beirut that the Israeli military warned was in its sights.

When a missile plunged from the sky moments later, the photojournalist and his lens were perfectly positioned to document the trail of destruction – second by second, frame by frame.

“I heard the sound of the missile whistling, headed toward the building and then I started filming,” photographer Bilal Hussein said on Tuesday, hours after Israeli forces launched the attack. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare.

The strike on Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings in the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital that they should evacuate the area.

He did not explain why the buildings were being targeted, other than to say they were near “interests and facilities” associated with the Hezbollah group.

The warning prompted many people to flee the busy, densely populated neighbourhood, even as others, including a few journalists, kept watch."

Images capture the exact moments an Israeli bomb strikes a building in Beirut
=============================================================================

             ![CAPTION CORRECTS TYPE OF MUNITION A bomb dropped from an Israeli jet hits a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. In the images that followed, a cloud of smoke and debris billowed outward as the building collapsed.

A bomb dropped from an Israeli jet hits a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, Tuesday, Oct. The images Hussein captured of the projectile, frozen in mid-flight before obliterating the structure, provide a striking look at the speed, power and devastation of modern warfare.

The strike Tuesday came roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on [Beirut’s southern outskirts](https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-strike-hospital-israel-rescue-survivors-rubble-da09186fc06d734e0457e6c099f3d992)
 that that they should evacuate the area.

The evidence supports the claim that there was an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific attack.

Even before the ground invasion, months of rocket strikes had damaged Yaroun, this satellite imagery from the summer shows.

But the new satellite imagery shows fresh destruction since the invasion, with a whole section of Yaroun flattened after Israeli military vehicles razed the area.

After a week of shelling, strikes and clearing, there are more visibly destroyed buildings than previously seen. 5

Maroun al-Ras has seen fighting before: It was the scene of a major battle during Israel’s 2006 invasion of Lebanon. Scores of homes leveled, a damaged health clinic and a centuries-old mosque now little more than rubble — toppled, a video suggests, in what appears to be a controlled explosion by the Israeli military.

These are some of the first glimpses to emerge from southern Lebanon, a week after Israel began its ground invasion there as part of its multipronged fight against Hezbollah. So are newly constructed banks of earth where the Israeli military set up positions for tanks and other military vehicles.

Over the past week, the Israeli military has flattened large parts of two border villages: Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun, seen in the video above that was filmed by the Israeli military and verified by The Times.

Hezbollah has been launching rockets aimed at Israel from southern Lebanon since last October in solidarity with Hamas. Hezbollah says it has targeted Israeli troops in both Maroun al-Ras and Yaroun with rocket barrages.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and the resulting conflict. <image:10230>

## Claim
Claim: "<image:10230> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024."

## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) reports on the ongoing conflict, including an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024, and an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on financial institutions linked to Hezbollah on October 21, 2024. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and the resulting conflict. <image:10230>


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10230>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) confirms that there was an Israeli attack in Beirut on October 21, 2024. The NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5159600/israel-strikes-hezbollah-banks-al-qard-al-hassan)) also supports this, reporting on Israeli airstrikes on the same date.

The evidence supports the claim that there was an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image depicts this specific attack.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 23, 2024, with images of an Israeli missile strike on a building in Beirut on October 22, 2024 (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>, <image:7>, <image:8>). The AP News article, published on October 22, 2024, features images of an Israeli airstrike on a building in Ghobeiri, Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday, October 22, 2024. The New York Times published an article on October 9, 2024, discussing the destruction in Lebanon, including satellite imagery from Planet Labs, dated October 28, 2024. The image <image:10230>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were Israeli attacks in Lebanon on October 21 and 22, 2024. However, the search results do not provide any information to confirm whether the image depicts an attack on October 21, 2024. The image could depict the attack on October 22, 2024, but this cannot be confirmed.

I need more information to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)

Content: "Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, “in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.”

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas," pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct."

Visual forensic analysis suggests that the widely circulated image of the alleged Ramat David Airbase attack is likely AI-generated.

Image: The image is claimed to be from a missile attack on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah.

An image circulating on various platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and Telegram, claims to show the aftermath of an alleged [missile attack](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)
 on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024. (See figure 2)

### Comparison to known incidents and visual evidence

The [Ramat David Airbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_David_Airbase)
 has been a significant target in previous conflicts, such as during the [Second Lebanon War](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/operation-gift)
 and, more recently, in 2024, amidst intensified conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.

Historically, images of the aftermath of attacks on military installations often display recognisable and identifiable military hardware. In contrast, this image presents vehicles that do not match any known military transport or logistical [vehicles used by Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Israel_Defense_Forces)
, the US, or any other military force worldwide.

Additionally, while it is reported that Hezbollah [launched](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)
 missiles at Ramat David on 22 September 2024, no credible visual evidence from trusted news outlets has confirmed the authenticity of the specific image in question. This channel and others play a significant role in circulating unverified or manipulated content, often blurring the line between authentic news and false narratives.

Lastly, upon a detailed visual forensic analysis of the image, it is highly likely that the image showing the aftermath of a supposed missile strike on Ramat David Airbase is AI-generated or significantly manipulated.

The following factors support this conclusion:

*   Unrecognisable vehicles that do not correspond with any existing military models.
*   Blurry and unreadable text on vehicles is typical of AI-generated images.
*   Inconsistent lighting and shadows that do not reflect the real-world impact of a large fire.
*   Symmetrical and uniform flames that lack the chaotic nature of real-world explosions.
*   A blurry background with unnatural transitions between foreground and distant elements.

The reported missile strike by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024 is a real event, but this image does not appear to be an accurate representation of that attack.

I do OSINT research, investigations, and analysis with a love for data visualisation and geospatial magic. The shapes and textures of these vehicles appear artificial, with distorted or unclear outlines that make it difficult to identify any specific model used by military forces around the world.

Typically, airbases, particularly one as strategic as Ramat David, house well-documented vehicle types, including fuel trucks, maintenance vehicles, and armoured transport. In this image, however, none of the vehicles can be compared to existing models, which raises suspicion about the image’s authenticity. A thorough analysis reveals that the image, widely shared on social media platforms, appears to be AI-generated or manipulated for the following reasons.

Figure 1: Social media accounts amplify the AI-generated image with thousands of impressions on X and Reddit.

Visual forensic analysis
------------------------

*   _Vehicles appear unrecognisable_

A significant red flag in the image is the unrecognisability of the vehicles shown. (See figure 2)

*   _Blurry text on vehicles_

One of the most prominent signs of AI-generated imagery is blurry or indecipherable text. This is a hallmark of AI manipulation, as text is often poorly rendered in AI-generated images."

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

 circulating on social media. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic."

POLITICO.EU ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)) also reported that Hezbollah launched rockets at the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024.

The Associated Press (NPR) ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/22/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says/)) reported that Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including the Ramat David airbase. The image <image:10243>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about the authenticity of the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine whether the image is authentic. This could be done by comparing the image to other images of the Ramat David airbase or by checking if any news outlets have reported on the image.

Content: "<image:12095>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:12096>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:12095>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:12098>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Content: "(Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages killed in Gaza. The evidence confirms the image's context and date. The claim is therefore partially correct.

The evidence does not specify whether the coffins represent soldiers or civilians. The claim is therefore not entirely accurate.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo): 
Content: "After almost 10 months of simmering conflict, the prospect of an all-out war scares many.

When Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hardline finance minister, arrives, the crowd swells and the sense of anger mounts.

He’s accosted by angry locals. Many people are simply standing by the crater, taking in the scene, lost in thought.

In the corner of the pitch, someone has tried to remove the bloodstains on the astroturf, but with only limited success.

Outside the fence, bicycles and scooters lie scattered, all blackened from yesterday’s brief but devastating fireball.

There’s a bomb shelter metres away, but when the siren sounded last night, the children had mere seconds to respond. They had absolutely no chance.

Israel says the rocket was fired from Shebaa, a small village just a short distance away across the western flank of Mt Hermon, which towers over Majdal Shams.

Hezbollah disputes Israel’s claim, but around the time the rocket landed here, its media outlets announced that it had fired rockets towards an Israeli military base less than two miles from the football pitch.

Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning'

Golan Heights strike: 'There was a siren, but no-one had time to react'

The scene around the football pitch here in Majdal Shams, where 12 children and young people died on Saturday, is quiet and deeply sombre.

There are plenty of people here - local Druze elders in their distinctive red and white turbans and baggy trousers, military officials, visiting government ministers and of course many journalists.

But conversations around the crater where the rocket landed are hushed, respectful.

A black flag flies at the spot where the rocket landed last night, gouging a shallow crater in the pitch and blowing out the metal fence around it. <image:12133>!Reuters People mourning after Golan Heights strike <image:12134>Reuters

Residents fear all-out war after an strike on a football pitch killed 12 children in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights

This is a day of funerals for those who died here, most of them boys and girls between 10 and 16. Some are demanding a decisive response against Hezbollah. Some accuse the government of abandoning the Golan Heights.

Mr Smotrich tries to offer his condolences, even to hug those around him. <image:12133>!Reuters Mourners surround coffins in the streets <image:12136>Reuters

Thousands gathered in the streets on Sunday for the funerals of the young people who were killed in the strike

The people of Majdal Shams are used to the sound of rockets overhead, but Saturday’s attack took them all by surprise.

“I don’t think the government needs to respond,” Nassar says. They don’t need more war,” another says.

CNN  — 

Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Lebanese militant group for [a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html)
 that killed 12 children, touching off fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.

Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks.

Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to a [statement](https://t.me/idfofficial/9222)
 from the military on Sunday morning. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes.

And on a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.

“Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.”

The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in a barrage Israel’s military quickly blamed on the Iran-backed militant group.

It killed 12 children and left 44 people injured, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.

The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN. Smotrich was eventually ushered away by security.

Fears of wider war spread
-------------------------

Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.

While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.

“We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” a statement read.

Analysing footage of the explosion and the aftermath, experts told CNN the blast and damage were consistent with the types of munitions fired at northern Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria.

Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told CNN Sunday that weapon fragments at the scene indicated the rocket was fired by Hezbollah or another militant group. His office said following the meeting that the cabinet had “authorized the prime minister and the minister of defense to decide on the nature of the response against the terror organization Hezbollah, and on its’ timing.”

The prime minister said earlier that he was “shocked” by the attack. Throughout the 34-day war, Hezbollah is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets – a daily average of 117.

Bou Habib stressed that another war would not only be detrimental to Lebanon, but to Israel as well.

“\[Israel\] will return to the stone ages as well, it’s not by the Lebanese government,” he said, referring to comments by Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant back in June 2023, in which he said the Israeli military could send Lebanon “back to the Stone Age.”

However, Bou Habib told the Lebanese Al Jadeed News TV channel that Lebanon had received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response would be “limited.” He added that Hezbollah would in turn limit its actions. Pressed by the anchor to identify the countries that had offered this reassurance, he hinted that the “US and France are very concerned about the issue.”

Lebanon has called for an international investigation into the attack to determine who was responsible.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

What happened early Sunday?
---------------------------

The situation between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group remains tense. Flights that were already en route to Ben Gurion were diverted to other airports.

Israel's Home Front Command raised the alert level in northern Israel and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters.

.

Earlier this month, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby [said the U.S. officials have been communicating continuously with their Israeli counterparts," National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement.

Here's a look at where things stand:

!ISRAEL-LEBANON-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-HEZBOLLAH-ATTACKS  <image:12173>

This photo taken from a position in northern Israel shows a Hezbollah UAV intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over north Israel on Aug. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it launched an attack on Israeli military positions with a large number of drones. Two other soldiers were "lightly and moderately injured," Israel said.

"Approximately ninety percent of the targets struck were short-range rockets aimed at northern Israel," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement on Sunday, adding, "Hezbollah planned to harm Israeli civilians."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at the start of a Cabinet meeting, said the military had eliminated "thousands of rockets that were aimed at northern Israel" and urged citizens to adhere to directives from the Home Front Command.

"We are determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us — we will harm them," he said.

What was involved in the attack
-------------------------------

Lt. "Most of them either fell on their way to Israeli territory, landed in open areas, or were intercepted by Israeli Air Force defense systems and Israeli Navy ships."

Hezbollah said its attack involved more than 320 Katyusha rockets aimed at multiple sites in Israel and a "large number" of drones. It said the operation was targeting "a qualitative Israeli military target that will be announced later" as well as "enemy sites and barracks and Iron Dome (missile defense) platforms."

Hezbollah later announced the end of what it said was the first stage of retaliatory strikes, which it said would allow it to launch more attacks deeper into Israel. was preparing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-says-potential-iran-hezbollah-israel-attack-this-week/)

The attacks come as delegations from the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt [are holding another round of cease-fire talks in Cairo](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-talks/)
.

A spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean Savett, said President Biden was "closely monitoring" the events in Israel and Lebanon and that he has been engaged with his national security team throughout the evening.

Key Points

*   Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones against Israel on Sunday in retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander in Beirut last month.
*   Hezbollah said it had launched more than 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets.
*   Israeli jets hit targets in Lebanon shortly before the strikes as the military assessed that Hezbollah was preparing to begin the barrage, the military said.

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel's military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a bigger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapor trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

The extent of damage was not immediately clear and Hezbollah indicated it was not planning further strikes yet, while Israel's Foreign Minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war.

Any major escalation in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah's backer Iran and Israel's main ally the United States.

Sunday's strikes came as negotiators were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch effort to conclude a halt to the fighting in Gaza.

The Iran-backed Lebanese group said it had fired 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets in what it called the first phase of its retaliation for Israel's assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander, last month.

Israel's military said it had foiled a much larger attack with pre-emptive airstrikes after assessing that Hezbollah was preparing to launch the barrage, using 100 jets to strike more than 40 Hezbollah launch sites in southern Lebanon.

The strikes destroyed thousands of launcher barrels, aimed mostly at northern Israel but also targeting some central areas, Israel's military said.

Hezbollah dismissed Israel's statement that the group's attack had been foiled with pre-emptive strikes, saying it had been able to launch its drones as planned and that the rest of its response to Shukr's killing would take "some time".

Israel's Army Radio, citing defense officials, said the military assessed that the Hezbollah barrage on northern Israel was "improvised" after the pre-emptive strike by Israeli jets on the Hezbollah launch sites.

Regional conflict risk
----------------------

President Joe Biden was following events closely, the White House said.

"At his direction, senior U.S. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was on high alert all over the country.

The Israeli military issued civil defense instructions from central Israel to the north, limiting gatherings but authorizing people to go to work as long as they were able to reach air raid shelters quickly. There were no casualties immediately reported in Israel, according to the ambulance service.

Israeli media said the barrage hitting northern areas had damaged some houses and a chicken coop.

A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country's south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.

One of the strikes on the town of Khiam killed one fighter from the Hezbollah-allied Shi'ite group Amal, two security sources told Reuters. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah will speak on television later on Sunday, the group said.

The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the U.N.'s special coordinator's office in the country called on all sides to cease fire, calling the developments overnight "worrying".

Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youngsters and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.

Warning sirens
--------------

In northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and multiple explosions were heard around several areas as Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon. We will keep supporting Israel's right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability," said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.

Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.

That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollah's most senior military commanders.

Shukr's death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisal against Israel by Iran."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, second left, and Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan, left, stand in a structure in the area of the former settlement of Sa-Nur in the northern West Bank, August 7, 2025. The two-word phrase, written in blue on the column on the photo's right, reads 'Death to Arabs.' (Roei Hadi/Samaria Regional Council)

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Thursday disavowed the slogan “Death to Arabs” after being photographed next to the graffitied phrase during a tour of the northern West Bank, in which he vowed to rebuild the settlement of Sa-Nur that was evacuated decades ago.

Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry, was photographed next to the slogan as he visited the site to mark 20 years since it and the nearby settlement Homesh were dismantled as part of Israel’s 2005 Disengagement Plan. The plan also saw Israel evacuate the Gaza Strip’s Gush Katif settlement bloc, which Smotrich has called on Israel to rebuild as well amid the war in Gaza.

Following online criticism of the photograph, Smotrich’s office said in a statement that the offending phrase was noticed only “after the photo was distributed, and of course we completely disavow it.”

Smotrich’s office said the media shouldn’t be concerned by “stupid graffiti that no one noticed,” but by the minister’s drive to “reverse the expulsion from northern Samaria and resettle Sa-Nur.”

The photograph was included in a press release by the Samaria Regional Council, which oversees settlers’ municipal affairs in the northern West Bank. Council head Yossi Dagan, who also appeared in the photo, later sent out a second press release with the “Death to Arabs” graffiti cropped out of the picture, without apologizing for the phrase or explaining the reason for the edit.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid slammed Smotrich on X: “Aside from the moral issue, what in God’s name does the government expect us to say to the world when a photo is published of a senior minister smiling next to the inscription ‘Death to Arabs’?”

[! “That applies to Gaza, and it’s even more true here.”

The Palestinian Authority issued a strong condemnation of Smotrich’s visit, saying it was part of “plans to entrench the gradual annexation of the West Bank, posing a direct threat to the possibility of implementing the two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In a statement, the PA foreign ministry said the push “to revive settlements that were evacuated 20 years ago” would lead to further confiscation of Palestinian lands.

Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed in May that Israel had approved the construction of 22 new West Bank settlements, including Sa-Nur and Homesh.

Israeli NGO Peace Now, which monitors settlement activity in the West Bank, said some of the 22 settlements the government announced as new had already existed on the ground.

Some are neighborhoods that were upgraded to independent settlements, and others are unrecognized outposts given formal status under Israeli law, according to Peace Now.

The CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html)) details a Hezbollah missile barrage against Israel.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results describe escalating tensions and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024. The CBS News article ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/)) reports on Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon and Hezbollah attacks on Israel, mentioning that Israel's Home Front Command raised the alert level and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters. The CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html)) details a Hezbollah missile barrage against Israel. The Washington Post article ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/25/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/25/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-strikes/)) reports on the heaviest strikes exchanged between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024. None of the articles mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. <image:12174>, <image:12173>, <image:12189>, <image:12133>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm escalating tensions and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, they do not mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich image location")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information about Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's presence in various locations and events. The Haaretz and Times of Israel articles mention Smotrich's visit to an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank on August 7, 2025, where he was photographed near graffiti. The Getty Images search result contains multiple photographs of Smotrich at different events, including a Jerusalem Day Flag March on June 5, 2024, a party meeting on February 5, 2024, and a visit to the Knesset. <image:12231>, <image:12232>, <image:12241>, <image:12242>, <image:12243>, <image:12244>, <image:12245>, <image:12246>, <image:12251>, <image:12252>, <image:12257>, <image:12258>

None of the provided sources mention the context of the image in the claim.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results provide information about Smotrich's presence in various locations and events, but none of them mention the context of the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The claim cannot be verified because the provided evidence does not support it. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, nor do they provide any context for the image. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is unverified. While there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at other events, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on that date ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)).

**An Algerian judoka has been disqualified after failing the weigh-in before facing an Israeli opponent at the Olympic Games.**

Messaoud Redouane Dris, 22, had been scheduled to face Tohar Butbul in the -73kg category on Monday.

However, Dris weighed in above the 73kg limit ahead of the contest and was removed from the draw.

Games organisers confirmed his disqualification and awarded Butbul a walkover to the next round.

Algeria's judo federation and national Olympic committee are yet to comment.

The Israeli Olympic Committee alleged his failure to compete had been deliberate and was strongly critical of the Algerian.

"Tohar's competitor has removed himself from the competition," the Israeli body said in a statement.

"The Israeli delegation will continue to compete with the Olympic values in mind, we believe this kind of behaviour has no place in the world of sport."

Another Algerian judoka, Fethi Nourine, was [handed a 10-year ban](/sport/olympics/58556940)
 by the International Judo Federation after withdrawing from a bout against Butbul at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

In that specific case, Nourine said at the time that his political support for the Palestinian cause made it impossible for him to compete.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

The evidence supports the claim that an Algerian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent. However, the reason for the withdrawal was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

Drone strikes Tel Aviv, killing one. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The Houthis say they are acting to show solidarity with the Palestinians over the war in Gaza, though the civilian shipping traffic involves vessels from around the world.

Tel Aviv came under heavy rocket fire from Hamas in the early weeks of the war last fall, but the attacks have long since stopped. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. <image:12306>

Israeli police investigate the scene of a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel on Friday. But this attack apparently caught Israeli forces off-guard.

Sirens typically provide a warning when Tel Aviv or other cities come under aerial attack. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. Hamas occasionally fires rockets into southern Israel.

The main aerial threat to Israel has been coming from the north, with Hezbollah and Israel trading rocket fire across the border on a daily basis.

Houthis Launch New Wave of Attacks
==================================

! But, global officials and most experts had, until the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, broadly assumed that the Houthis would continue to focus their response to the Gaza war on [attacking commercial shipping](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-march-26/)
 in the Red Sea. The attacks came after the latest in a series of lulls in Houthi attacks on shipping – halts that, in the past, led to speculation that the [Houthi weapons arsenals](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-january-22/)
 might be running low.

The Houthi strike on Tel Aviv has moved the group from the margins of the Gaza conflict to the center of diplomacy and the allied strategy to try to end the fighting permanently. and its allies have used to try to end the Houthi strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have failed to deter the group.
*   The Houthis’ ability to continue striking targets in and around Yemen suggests their missile and drone arsenal was more extensive than was believed and the group might still be receiving resupply from Iran.
*   Israel’s retaliation on an oil refinery at Hodeidah could complicate U.S.-led efforts to contain the Houthi threat and potentially expand regional warfare even further.

**The threat to regional peace and security posed by the [Houthi movement (Ansarallah)](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-june-11/)
 in Yemen expanded Friday when the group launched an explosive-laden drone on Tel Aviv in the pre-dawn hours, striking an apartment building and killing an Israeli man while wounding several others.** The drone reportedly flew near the U.S. forces but later assessed the attack was by Israel, and quoted Yemen’s Health Ministry as reporting the strike had killed and wounded several persons.

The Houthi attack on Tel Aviv demonstrated that U.S. The Houthi attacks have reduced commercial ship traffic by nearly half, but otherwise produced no measurable effect on Israeli, U.S., or global policy on the Gaza war or the broader region.

The Tel Aviv drone strike came days after the Houthis demonstrated they still have an ample and varied supply of weaponry in their arsenal. escalation against the Houthis has the potential to further expand the Gaza crisis into a regional conflagration.

**Bottom Line up Front**

*   On Friday, the Houthi movement in Yemen sought to implement its threats against Israel by conducting a strike on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone.
*   The diplomatic, military, and economic tools the U.S. Two attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted ships in the Red Sea on July 15, even as the U.S. The spokesman said that Tel Aviv will continue to be a primary target for the terror group “within the range of our weapons.”

The attack rattled the Israeli security establishment, which has prided itself on fielding the most sophisticated missile, rocket, and drone defense in the region, if not the world."

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

‍

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

 Most personal Windows PCs were unaffected, since CrowdStrike's software was primarily used by organisations.[\[18\]](#cite_note-CS_servers_down-18)
 The CrowdStrike software did not provide a way for subscribers to delay the installation of its content files.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 Computers running [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")

 Within hours, CrowdStrike [CEO](/wiki/CEO "CEO")
 [George Kurtz](/wiki/George_Kurtz "George Kurtz")

### Remedy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Remedy")\
\]

Affected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")
, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike.com-240719-23)

If crashes persisted, remediation required booting into [safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode")
 or the [Windows Recovery Environment](/wiki/Windows_Recovery_Environment "Windows Recovery Environment")
 and deleting any `.sys` file beginning with `C-00000291-` and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the `[%windir%](/wiki/%25windir%25 "%windir%") \[System32](/wiki/Special_folder#File_system_directories "Special folder") \[drivers](/wiki/Driver_(computing) "Driver (computing)") \CrowdStrike\` directory.[\[28\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike_072024-28)
 As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was "expected to take days" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[\[33\]](#cite_note-CSI_1-33)
[\[34\]](#cite_note-HOB_1-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-CSW_1-35)

On devices with Windows' [BitLocker](/wiki/BitLocker "BitLocker")
 disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely.

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

Flight cancellations into or out of the US have topped 3,000 flights as of 8:40 p.m. “But at that point, the damage had been done, and we now had to move into manual mode.”

In manual mode, it takes a village to reboot computer devices and reload operating systems, DeWalt said, adding some of the companies “spent the entire night deploying thousands of people by hand reloading operating systems, starting servers back up again.”

After discovering the problem wasn’t an attack, but rather a conflict with a Microsoft update that occurred earlier, the group had to race against the clock.

The ongoing global IT outage is impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.

Marriott International has nearly 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, according to the company’s website.

**Impact at other hotels:** An assistant manager at the Hilton Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, said they have been having to manually unlock guests’ rooms because the outage impacted the software the hotel uses to make key cards.

Businesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.

The outage came as cybersecurity giant [CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-suffers-major-outage-affecting-businesses-around-the-world.html)
 early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is "actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.

"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.

"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again," he wrote.

Over 10,000 Israelis relocate to Canada since early 2024
========================================================

Published :  

15-11-2024 13:13|

[World](/section/4)

Since Oct. 7, 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in the number of "Israelis" seeking to relocate to Canada, "Israeli" newspaper Haaretz reported.

Reports from Canadian immigration authorities show that over 10,000 "Israelis" made the move to Canada in early 2024, with around 8,000 of them obtaining work visas. This marks a significant jump compared to previous years.

While political unrest and escalating violence in the region are major contributors, many "Israelis" cite dissatisfaction with the state of the country’s political system and social inequalities as additional driving forces behind their decision to leave.

Data from the Canadian Ministry of Immigration reveals that between December 2023 and September 2024, a total of 3,425 temporary work visas were approved for "Israelis", out of 3,705 applications.

Moreover, "Israeli" media outlets such as Yedioth Ahronoth reported that even before the aggression on Gaza reached its current intensity, there was a rising trend in the number of "Israelis" choosing to emigrate

Chinese travel agencies have canceled trips to Israel amid the escalated conflict there, which flared up over the weekend. Chinese airlines have adjusted flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.  
   
"We quickly screened all orders after the conflict broke out, and as of now, our company has no tourists stranded in Israel," Tongcheng Travel told the Global Times on Monday morning.   
  
For travel groups planning to travel to Israel in October and November, the company communicated with those clients and processed full refunds. In addition, business work related to tourism in Israel has been temporarily suspended, the agency noted.   
  
GZL International Travel Service told the Global Times that it has decided to cancel all travel groups to Israel in October. It sent two travel groups to the country in September, but both have since returned to China.    
  
Chinese travel agency Spring Tour confirmed to the Global Times that the company has canceled a 28-member tour to Israel that was scheduled to depart on Monday, given the escalated tensions there, and tours departing after that point will be subject to notifications from relevant departments and the actual situation on the ground.  
  
The move came after the escalated conflict there, as Israel's cabinet declared a "state of war" on Sunday against Hamas, in which at least 700 in Israel died while retaliatory Israeli airstrikes killed at least 413 in Gaza, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.  
  
On August 10 , the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the third list of countries, including Israel, to resume outbound group tours.  
   
China's Hainan Airlines, the only carrier in China with flights to Israel, told the Global Times that it canceled flights between Shanghai and Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday due to the ongoing high tensions there, and will adjust flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.   
  
The airline has three direct flights between China and the country, which depart from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, operating twice a week on each route.  
  
Data shared by the information provider VariFlight showed that the flight from Shenzhen to Tel Aviv on Tuesday was canceled.  
  
The airline later said on its official Weibo on Monday afternoon that its follow-up flight plans for Israel routes will continue to be implemented. There has been no adjustment for the time being in an effort to maximize and ensure the normal travel of passengers.  
  
It will pay close attention to changes in the overseas security situation and dynamically adjust relevant flight plans as soon as possible, the airline said.   
  
The Foreign Ministry activated the emergency consular protection mechanism immediately after the conflict broke out to coordinate and engage in work on protecting Chinese nationals and institutions in Palestine and Israel, said Mao Ning, ministry spokesperson, on Monday. The spokesperson reminded Chinese nationals not to travel to Palestine or Israel.   
  
We would like to once again call on relevant parties to immediately stop the fighting, protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. Mao said.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`

Content: "![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

Yemen’s [Houthi group](/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide)
 has claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which killed one person and injured at least 10.

A spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media on Friday that the Iran-aligned group had “targeted ‘Tel Aviv’ in occupied Palestine”.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead. The rebels fired a "new drone called 'Yafa', which is capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems," Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a statement on social media.(Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN / AFP)](/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AFP__20240719__364K2UX__v4__HighRes__IsraelYemenPalestinianConflictExplosion-1721380407.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

The Israeli government has [banned Al Jazeera](/news/2024/5/6/israel-bans-al-jazeera-what-does-it-mean-and-what-happens-next)
 from broadcasting from the country.

“Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv."

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

Following renewed Houthi missile threats, major airlines have extended flight suspensions to Israel, citing escalating security risks near Ben Gurion Airport.

![Houthi Israel Airport](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militia has again threatened to strike Israel’s main international gateway, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), raising concerns over flight safety and prompting international [airline](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/topic/airlines/)
 responses.

**Details on Houthis’ threats to Israel and Ben Gurion Airport** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer posted a photo of TLV on social media platform X with the warning: “In the coming hours, Yemeni forces will carry out military operations against Ben Gurion and other Zionist airports.” The statement mirrored recent IDF evacuation alerts for Houthi-held Yemeni ports.

The latest threat marks the second in 24 hours. Earlier, Amer warned: “We will strike Ben Gurion Airport in the coming hours. Evacuate immediately.” Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Amer urged international airlines to avoid TLV and Israeli airspace: “They should change course and take seriously the warnings of the Yemeni military… not only over Ben Gurion Airport but over all of Israeli airspace.”

In response, the Israeli Air Force [bombed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7050j07gedo)
 key Houthi infrastructure, including Sanaa Airport (SAH).

Amid the rising threat, several international airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Let’s keep exploring the future of aviation together!

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.
