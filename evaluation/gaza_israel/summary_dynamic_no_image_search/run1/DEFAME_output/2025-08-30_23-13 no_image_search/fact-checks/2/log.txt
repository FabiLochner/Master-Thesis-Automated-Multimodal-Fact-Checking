Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/08/04/how-a-photo-of-a-skeletal-child-sparked-controversy-about-starvation-in-gaza): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on August 4, 2025, discusses a photo of an emaciated child in Gaza that sparked controversy about starvation in Gaza. The article mentions that the photo was published by The New York Times and other media outlets. The article also mentions that the boy in the photo, Mohammed, has a serious disorder. The article states that the World Health Organisation (WHO) says malnutrition in Gaza has reached "alarming levels" and that there have been at least 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025. <image:10198> is not mentioned in the article.

The claim '<image:10198> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The image is AI-generated, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)). Therefore, the claim that it is an authentic image is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
