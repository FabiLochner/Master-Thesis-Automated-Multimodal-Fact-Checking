## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`

Content: The search result from Kashif.ps, published on March 24, 2025, states that the image ![image 10198](media/2.jpg) is AI-generated. The article mentions that the image has several defects and deformities, such as distortions in the skeleton and the woman's dress. The article also notes that the background lacks depth and visual dimension and that an AI program logo appears in the image. The article also mentions that the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from some areas of the Gaza Strip, and mass graves were discovered.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC published an article on January 23, 2025, about the search for missing people in Gaza, including images of human remains found in the rubble and a man who found a skeleton in his home. The Middle East Eye published an article on August 1, 2025, about the child Mohammed al-Mutawaq, whose body resembled a "skeleton" due to starvation in Gaza, including an image of the child and his mother, Hidaya (![image 10198](media/2.jpg)). The Euronews article, published on August 4, 2025, discusses a photo of an emaciated child in Gaza that sparked controversy about starvation in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The image is AI-generated, according to the reverse image search result from Kashif.ps ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)). The article mentions defects and deformities in the image.

The web search results provide context about the situation in Gaza, including the discovery of human remains and cases of child starvation. However, these results do not validate the claim that the image is authentic.


## Final Judgement
The image is confirmed to be AI-generated, as indicated by the reverse image search result. The claim that it is an authentic image is therefore false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image is AI-generated, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/03/24/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)). Therefore, the claim that it is an authentic image is false.
