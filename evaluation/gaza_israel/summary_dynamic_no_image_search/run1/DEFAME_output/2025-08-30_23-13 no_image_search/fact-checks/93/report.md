## Actions

web_search("airport crowd after attack July 19 2024")
reverse_search(![image 10255](media/93.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image ![image 10255](media/93.jpg).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10255](media/93.jpg)

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results mention flight cancellations to Israel due to security concerns and Houthi threats to Ben Gurion Airport, as reported by [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-20/ty-article/.premium/delta-suspends-flights-to-israel-until-september-30-which-airlines-are-still-flying/00000191-70ba-d7fc-ab93-f2bf4c4f0000) and the [International Airport Review](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/273457/houthi-threats-to-ben-gurion-airport-spark-fresh-wave-of-airline-suspensions-to-israel-over-safety-fears/). The International Airport Review also mentions a global IT outage. Neither source contains the image ![image 10255](media/93.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that on July 19, 2024, Ben Gurion Airport experienced a global IT outage and faced threats from the Houthis. The image ![image 10255](media/93.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack and a global IT outage on that day, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage or the security concerns.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unsubstantiated. While there was a global IT outage and a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, affecting Ben Gurion Airport, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the attack. The image could be related to the IT outage or security concerns, but the claim's specific context is not supported by the evidence.
