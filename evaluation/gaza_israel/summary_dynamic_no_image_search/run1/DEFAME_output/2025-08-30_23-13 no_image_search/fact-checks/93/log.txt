Useful result: From [Source](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/273457/houthi-threats-to-ben-gurion-airport-spark-fresh-wave-of-airline-suspensions-to-israel-over-safety-fears/): 
Content: The International Airport Review published on May 20, 2025, discusses Houthi threats to Ben Gurion Airport, which led to airline suspensions. The article mentions a social media post by a Houthi official with a warning about potential attacks on Ben Gurion Airport. The article also mentions a global IT outage. The article does not contain the image <image:10255>
The claim '<image:10255> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there was a global IT outage and a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024, affecting Ben Gurion Airport, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport due to the attack. The image could be related to the IT outage or security concerns, but the claim's specific context is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
