## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 10201](media/5.jpg)) appears in articles about Israeli helicopters. One article from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/)) discusses an attempt by Palestinian Islamic Jihad to down an Israeli helicopter in May 2019 and also mentions an Israeli helicopter downed by Hezbollah in 2006. Another article from Assahifa.com ([https://www.assahifa.com/english/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-targets-israeli-helicopter-in-eastern-gaza/](https://www.assahifa.com/english/middle-east/hamas-armed-wing-targets-israeli-helicopter-in-eastern-gaza/)) reports that Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades claimed to have struck an Israeli helicopter in October 2023.

Arab News PK ([https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east)) published an article about an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip on March 25, 2019, which also includes the image (![image 10201](media/5.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel reports that on November 2, 2024, an IDF helicopter intercepted a Hezbollah drone near Haifa. The article also mentions that over 130 rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday, and 10 drones targeted the country. Aerotime.aero published an article on November 3, 2024, about an Israeli AH-64 Apache helicopter shooting down a drone on November 2, 2024, south of Haifa, Israel. The drone was launched by Hezbollah. Factly states that the image in the claim is from 2019 and shows a Hamas attack on an Israeli helicopter. There are no recent reports of Israeli helicopters being shot down by Hezbollah.
