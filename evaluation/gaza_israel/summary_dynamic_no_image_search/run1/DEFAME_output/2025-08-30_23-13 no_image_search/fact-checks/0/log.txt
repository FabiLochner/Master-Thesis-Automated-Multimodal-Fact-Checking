Useful result: From [Source](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/photo-us-army-general-killed-110919596.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the image <image:10196>
The claim '<image:10196> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. There is no evidence to support the existence of a General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip. The image, which was geolocated to various countries including the United States, is of a U.S. Army general, but not the one mentioned in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
