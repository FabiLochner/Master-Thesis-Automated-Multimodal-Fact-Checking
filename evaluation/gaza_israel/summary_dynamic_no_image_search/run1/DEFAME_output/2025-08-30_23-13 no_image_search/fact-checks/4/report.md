### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reported on December 22, 2024, that the U.S. launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen in response to Houthi attacks against U.S. navy warships and merchant vessels. The article also mentions that Israel launched strikes against ports and energy infrastructure in Houthi-held parts of Yemen. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen)) ![image 10344](media/2025-08-30_23-15-1756595747-735267.jpg)

Al Jazeera reported on December 22, 2024, that two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down over the Red Sea in a "friendly fire" incident. The article also mentions that Yemen's Houthi fighters claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S Truman. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/us-army-says-two-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-friendly-fire](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/22/us-army-says-two-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-friendly-fire)) The image ![image 10200](media/4.jpg) is not in the search result. Reuters reported that the U.S. military conducted an airstrike on December 16, 2024, against a Houthi command and control facility in Yemen. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us-airstrike-hits-houthi-command-control-facility-yemen-2024-12-16/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-airstrike-hits-houthi-command-control-facility-yemen-2024-12-16/))


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image provided in the claim is of the destruction of Al-Aqsa TV headquarters in Gaza by Israeli warplanes on November 12, 2018, according to the reverse image search. The web search confirms that the U.S. did launch airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024, but the image does not depict this event.


## Final Judgement
The image is from 2018 and depicts the destruction of Al-Aqsa TV headquarters in Gaza. While the U.S. did launch airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024, the image does not depict this event.
