## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages, including Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, on February 20, 2025. (![image 12096](media/2025-08-31_00-13-1756599206-624676.jpg), ![image 12098](media/2025-08-31_00-13-1756599207-293660.jpg)) The Times of Israel and Euronews both reported on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where protesters carried mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to represent hostages killed in Gaza.

The protesters were angry with the Israeli government.


## Elaboration
The image in the claim depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages killed in Gaza. The evidence confirms the image's context and date. The claim is therefore partially correct.

The evidence does not specify whether the coffins represent soldiers or civilians. The claim is therefore not entirely accurate.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages killed in Gaza. The claim is partially correct as it correctly identifies the image's context and date. However, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not specify whether the coffins represent soldiers or civilians.
