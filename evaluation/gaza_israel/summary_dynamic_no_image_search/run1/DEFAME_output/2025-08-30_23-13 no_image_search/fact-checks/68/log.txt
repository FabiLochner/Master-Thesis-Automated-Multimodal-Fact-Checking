Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/7/17/aftermath-of-deadly-israeli-air-attacks-in-damascus):

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/syria-bombing): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains multiple images related to bombings and explosions in Syria. Some images show explosions and smoke, including one from May 3, 2025, near a military hospital in Harasta, northeast Damascus, following Israeli airstrikes <image:11845>, <image:11846>, <image:11847>, <image:11844>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/17/world/video/jeremy-diamond-syria-druze-damascus-digvid): 
Content: The CNN article, published on July 17, 2025, reports on Israeli strikes on Damascus, Syria. <image:10236> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:10236> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While it is true that Israel conducted airstrikes in southern Syria and outside Damascus in February 2025, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/26/israel-bombs-military-targets-in-southern-syria-outside-damascus) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation), the provided evidence does not confirm that the image depicts those specific events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
