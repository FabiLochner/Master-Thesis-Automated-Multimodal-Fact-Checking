## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results describe the 2025 Myanmar earthquake that occurred on March 28, 2025, with a magnitude of 7.7-7.9. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar, and caused damage in Myanmar, Thailand, and parts of China. The disaster resulted in significant casualties and economic losses, with international aid efforts and the impact of the Myanmar civil war also being mentioned.

The sources include information from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), disasterphilanthropy.org ([https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2025-myanmar-and-thailand-earthquake/](https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2025-myanmar-and-thailand-earthquake/)), and ScienceDirect ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017)). The disasterphilanthropy.org source also mentions a high-rise building collapse in Bangkok, Thailand. ![image 10197](media/1.jpg)

## Elaboration
The web search confirms the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as stated in the claim. The search results also mention significant damage and casualties. However, the search results do not provide any information about the image's origin or whether it depicts the aftermath of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake.

I still need more information to verify the claim, such as the source of the image or any related news reports.
