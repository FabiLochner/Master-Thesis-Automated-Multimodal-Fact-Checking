Useful result: From [Source](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel): 
Content: The USNI News article, published on August 2, 2024, reports that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East. The move is in response to threats from Iran.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html): 
Content: The search result from Military.com, published on September 20, 2024, discusses the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The article mentions that the U.S. has kept an increased military presence in the Middle East throughout much of the past year, with about 40,000 forces, at least a dozen warships and four Air Force fighter jet squadrons spread across the region. The article also mentions that several weeks ago, the total spiked to nearly 50,000 when Austin ordered two aircraft carriers and their accompanying warships to stay in the region as tensions roiled between Israel and Lebanon. <image:12294> shows an HSC-7 helicopter landing on the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Laboon in the Red Sea, June 12, 2024.

The claim '<image:10250> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024 as stated in the claim. While there was an increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, the image is unrelated to this. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
