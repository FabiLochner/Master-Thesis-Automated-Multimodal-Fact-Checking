The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence indicates that the assassination plot was orchestrated by an Iranian government official, not Jewish Americans, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/doj-charges-three-iranian-plot-to-kill-donald-trump). The second part of the claim is partially supported by evidence of US military involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, as discussed by [PBS NewsHour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-military-strikes-iranian-nuclear-sites-in-israel-iran-war).

So, the overall veracity is: false
