Useful result: From [Source](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024): 
Content: The search result from ReliefWeb discusses attacks on September 30, including attacks by the "Islamic Resistance in Iraq" on Israeli targets.

The claim '<image:10206> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim has been used in different contexts, including an explosion in Kandahar and an explosion at a plant in Alpha, Warren County. While there was a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport on September 30, 2024, the image is not associated with this event according to the search results ([https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-09-30/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-in-baghdad-military-sources-say](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-09-30/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-in-baghdad-military-sources-say)).
