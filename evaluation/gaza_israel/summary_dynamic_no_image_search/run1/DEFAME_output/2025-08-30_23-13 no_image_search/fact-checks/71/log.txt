Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html): 
Content: The image shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, modified into a fruit stand. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The article was published on February 3, 2025. <image:11849>, <image:11850>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses the Merkava tank, a series of main battle tanks used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Merkava entered service in 1979. <image:10238> is not shown in the search result.

Useful result: From [Source](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/israels-merkava-tank-armored-juggernaut-214399/): 
Content: The National Interest discusses the Merkava series of main battle tanks (MBT), which has been the centerpiece of Israel’s armored corps for more than four decades. The IDF introduced its fifth-generation “Barak” variant in 2023. The author is Maya Carlin, a National Security Writer with The National Interest.

The claim '<image:10238> This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a T-55 tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand in Syria, not a Merkava tank in Gaza, as claimed. The image was taken before January 2025, and the tank is not an Israeli Merkava tank, but a Syrian T-55 tank, according to a fact-check from [AOL](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
