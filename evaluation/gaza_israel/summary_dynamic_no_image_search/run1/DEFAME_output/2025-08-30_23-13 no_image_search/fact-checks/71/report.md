Content: The search result is from a Turkish news website and contains an image of a tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand. ![image 11751](media/2025-08-31_00-04-1756598690-318366.jpg) The article states that the tank was abandoned by regime forces in Syria.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`

### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 10238](media/71.jpg)) shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, modified into a fruit stand. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The article was published on February 3, 2025. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html)) The Merkava tank is a series of main battle tanks used by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). (![image 11849](media/2025-08-31_00-06-1756598760-575659.jpg), ![image 11850](media/2025-08-31_00-06-1756598761-020165.jpg))

The Merkava series has been the centerpiece of Israel’s armored corps for more than four decades. The IDF introduced its fifth-generation “Barak” variant in 2023.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a T-55 tank, not a Merkava tank. The tank is located in Syria, not Gaza. The image was taken before January 2025, as the article was published on February 3, 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a T-55 tank in Syria, not a Merkava tank in Gaza. The image was taken before January 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a T-55 tank used as a fruit and vegetable stand in Syria, not a Merkava tank in Gaza, as claimed.
