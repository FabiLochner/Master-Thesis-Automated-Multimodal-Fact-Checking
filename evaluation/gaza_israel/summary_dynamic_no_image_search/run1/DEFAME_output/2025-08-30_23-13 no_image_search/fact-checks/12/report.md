## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to be unlawful and obligated Israel to end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

The UN website ([https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/)) published a report on December 19, 2024, regarding the ICJ's advisory opinion. The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful (![image 10577](media/2025-08-30_23-24-1756596275-915204.jpg)). The UN General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution giving effect to the ICJ's opinion.


## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to be unlawful.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the ICJ declared Israel an "illegal state." However, the ICJ's finding that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful could be interpreted as a step towards that conclusion.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but it requires further clarification to determine if the ICJ's opinion equates to declaring Israel an illegal state.


## Final Judgement
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, stating that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful. While the ICJ's opinion does not explicitly declare Israel an "illegal state," it does find Israel's presence in the occupied territories to be unlawful.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as the ICJ did make a ruling regarding Israel's actions. However, the claim's wording is not entirely accurate, as the ICJ did not explicitly declare Israel an "illegal state." Therefore, the claim is not entirely false, but it is also not entirely true. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024, finding Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to be unlawful, and obligated Israel to end its unlawful presence. While the ICJ's opinion did not explicitly declare Israel an "illegal state," it did find Israel's presence in the occupied territories to be unlawful, as reported by the UN ([https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-icj-19dec24/)).
