## Actions

web_search("Israeli missile attack Iran October 26 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10204](media/9.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Israeli strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024, in response to Iranian strikes earlier in the month. The strikes, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance, targeted military sites, including air defense batteries, missile production facilities, and a nuclear weapons research facility. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran)), AP News ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-26-2024-9c9f366c71c508e6dd0ee74cff8400d2](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-iran-news-10-26-2024-9c9f366c71c508e6dd0ee74cff8400d2)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)) all mention the date and the retaliatory nature of the attacks.

The articles include images of the strikes and Israeli aircraft. The image ![image 10204](media/9.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli strikes on Iran occurred on October 26, 2024. The web search results mention the date and the retaliatory nature of the attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image depicts the Israeli missile attack on Iran.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if the image is related to the Israeli strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024. This would require comparing the image to other images or videos of the event.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 10204](media/9.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'China': 0.42, 'Malaysia': 0.32, 'Taiwan': 0.13, 'Singapore': 0.03, 'Australia': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Japan': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results suggest that the image was most likely taken in China or Malaysia. This information contradicts the claim that the image depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely taken in China or Malaysia, which contradicts the claim that it depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran. The web search confirms that Israeli strikes on Iran occurred on October 26, 2024, but the image's origin does not align with the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in question was likely taken in China or Malaysia, according to geolocation data, which contradicts the claim that it depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran. While web searches confirm that Israeli strikes on Iran occurred on October 26, 2024, the image's origin does not align with the claim.
