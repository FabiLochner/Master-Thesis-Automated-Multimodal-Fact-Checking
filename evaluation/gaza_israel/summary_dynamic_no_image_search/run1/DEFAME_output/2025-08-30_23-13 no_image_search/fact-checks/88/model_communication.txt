| **"From Commander to Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?"**  <br>  <br>  <br><br>> The X post by @MOSSADil  <br>> juxtaposes two images of Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, showing him in official military attire and later in civilian disguise, hinting at an escape or survival tactic following reported Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which The New York Times claimed killed him—yet his reappearance challenges that narrative.  <br>>   <br>> Historical context reveals Qaani’s role expanded after Qasem Soleimani’s 2020 assassination, with him overseeing extraterritorial operations and financial support to groups like Hezbollah, making him a high-value target; his survival suggests advanced evasion strategies, possibly informed by Iran’s experience with past Mossad operations.  <br>>   <br>> No peer-reviewed studies directly address this event, but intelligence analysis from sources like the Institute for National Security Studies indicates Israel’s use of AI and drones in recent strikes, implying Qaani’s escape may reflect counterintelligence adaptations to such technology, a development not yet widely acknowledged in mainstream reports.  <br>>   <br><br>[https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08](https://x.com/MOSSADil/status/1937910103413305647?t=U-jJJCUJfAiMFHTQUo7QSw&s=08)<br><br>**2 Likes**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372980_screenshot20250626135815x_jpeg6f297ae460a3af6b763a91ab2860e060)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372981_20250626135822_jpegc08e73ef887b6ca54a330b84be6c0905)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372982_20250626135825_jpeg180b82528e58725485b2e7c2d1d64386)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/19372983_20250626135832_jpegdff47f83bbe7b7ca12d42dcd0cbca00f) |

There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker. Core personnel should avoid the limelight.. I also know telecommunications can be intercepted and cloned to look like the real person was talking no one believed me.

There has been no news regarding the whereabouts of Major General Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in recent days.

Qaani was notably absent from a ceremony where IRGC Air Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh received a medal for striking Israel last week. Israel’s Channel 12 also reported that the possibility of Qaani being injured in a bomb explosion is under investigation.

**Iranian Silence and Denials**

The Iranian government has remained silent regarding Esmail Qaani's disappearance. Mohammad Mehdi Hemmat, the son of a martyr from the Iran-Iraq war, posted on X , “Our dear Haji Esmail Qaani is in perfect health. Don’t fall for the enemy’s media games, which only show their weakness.” 

Media outlets close to the IRGC also shared a social media post from Qaani’s nephew, asserting that he is alive.  

Old reports from Mehr News Agency and IRIB, titled “Denial of Esmail Qaani’s Martyrdom,” were republished on social media on October 5 and 6, though these reports were outdated.

Additionally, Hamshahri Online stated that the Parliament News Agency, citing a member of the Parliament’s Security Commission, confirmed Qaani’s well-being. However, the Parliament News Agency later denied interviewing Abbas Golrou, the member in question.

**Who is Esmail Qaani, The Missing Commander?**  

Esmail Qaani was appointed as the commander of the Quds Force following the assassination of his predecessor, Qasem Soleimani. He was then appointed deputy commander of the Quds Force.

Despite his long tenure in Quds Force, Esmail Qaani struggled to match Qasem Soleimani’s influence. The extensive propaganda, including legendary stories, books, films, and countless public events left little room for Qaani to build his mark.

One of Qaani’s rare public comments came in December 2022 regarding women without hijabs. His disappearance, however, has sparked jokes and speculation on social media.

The last confirmed sighting of Qaani was on September 29 at Hezbollah’s office in Tehran.

**Last Seen in Beirut**

According to The Times of Israel and The Jerusalem Post, Qaani was last seen in Lebanon’s southern suburbs of Beirut, an area targeted by Israeli airstrikes last week.

Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, participates in a religious ceremony in Tehran on June 13th. \[Getty\]

The commander of [Iran's Quds Force](https://www.newarab.com/news/after-irans-rockets-hit-israel-commits-massacres-gaza)
 Esmail Qaani is in "good health", the unit's deputy commander said Monday, following claims he had possibly been assassinated by Israel

Iraj Masjedi said Qaani, who heads the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) expeditionary force was safe and no further statement on the issue is needed.

It follows comments made by two senior Iranian security officials on Sunday that Qaani had not been heard from since a huge wave of Israeli airstrikes on Beirut late last week, which is believed to have killed senior Hezbollah and Iranian commanders.

Qaani traveled to Lebanon after an Israeli air strike killed [Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-military-says-hezbollah-chief-nasrallah-eliminated)
 and IRGC top general Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut.

Contact with Nasrallah's replacement Hashem Safieddine has also been reportedly lost, with fears in the group that he could have been targeted and killed also in the strikes, which have resulted in hundreds of civilians killed.

On Tuesday, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [fired some 200 missiles](https://www.newarab.com/news/irans-khamenei-says-iran-missile-attack-israel-legitimate)
 at Israel in retaliation for the killings of the leaders. 

It was Iran's second direct attack on Israel in six months, after a missile and drone assault in April in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in Damascus, which Tehran blamed on Israel.

Tehran named Qaani the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps' overseas force after US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of [Qassem Soleimani](https://www.newarab.com/video/twin-blast-kills-dozens-irans-qassem-soleimani-memorial)
 in a drone strike in Baghdad in 2020.

Part of Qaani's task in that post has been to manage Tehran's paramilitary allies across the Middle East, as well as in other regions around the world, who have been key pillars of support for Iran's axis allies in the region, including Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.

These groups have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent months, including the Hashd Al-Shaabi in Iraq, the [Houthis of Yemen](https://www.newarab.com/news/official-denies-us-offered-recognise-houthi-sanaa-government)
, and Iranian-led Shia militias in Syria.

When Qaani took over the force after deputising Soleimani for over two decades, he vowed to boot US forces out of the Middle East in revenge for Soleimani's killing.

"We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force ... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region," state radio quoted Qaani as saying ahead of Soleimani's funeral in Tehran.

Qaani, 67, was born in Mashhad, a conservative Shia Muslim religious city in northeastern Iran. He fought for the Revolutionary Guards during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and has experience in overseas operations beyond Iran's eastern borders, including Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He does not speak Arabic, unlike Soleimani who spoke fluently with Iraqi militias and Hezbollah commanders.

He has adopted less of a public persona than Soleimani and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Unlike Soleimani, who over the years was widely photographed on battlefields in Iraq and Syria alongside the militias Tehran has armed and trained, Qaani has preferred to keep a lower profile and conduct most of his meetings and visits to neighbouring countries in private. 

He has adopted a low public profile compared to Soleimani - who was seen as a daring, down-to-earth, and charismatic figure - and little information is available on him online or in leaked diplomatic cables.

Qaani’s Growing Leadership Struggles in a Post-Soleimani World
==============================================================

About the Authors

[Jaber Rajabi](/experts/jaber-rajabi)

Jaber Rajabi is a former official in more than one Iran-backed Iraqi militia. In 2016, Rajabi defected from the so-called Axis of Resistance and became a vocal opponent of the Islamic Republic’s policies in the region as well as its domestic policies.

Brief Analysis

After the killing of Qods Force commander Qasem Soleimani, Esmail Qaani may have inherited a role for which he was not prepared, bringing instead a new style of leadership to the IRGC.

Upon the death of Soleimani, Esmail Qaani took over this role as spelled out in Soleimani’s own will. Further signs of Qaani’s limited control include [Asaib Ahl al-Haq](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/profile-asaib-ahl-al-haq-0)
 and the Badr Organization’s private attacks on him, and Muqtada al-Sadr’s refusal to allow Qaani to enter his house multiple times.

This new reality has ultimately had an impact on how Tehran manages its proxy relationships writ large. However, if he does manage to retain his position, Qaani will likely aim to carry out a wide-ranging structural change in the Qods Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, further bringing the force out of the age of Soleimani and into a different kind of role in the region to match Qaani’s own leadership style and limitations.

[Sign up for email alerts](http://info.washingtoninstitute.org/acton/form/19961/0002:d-0001/0/-/-/-/-/index.htm) Yet understanding Qaani’s position under Soleimani helps explain some of his subsequent decisionmaking as Qods Force leader, along with some of the challenges he currently faces in that role.

During Soleimani's tenure as Qods Force commander, Qaani's role was mostly focused on managing the force's internal affairs. Soleimani was either traveling or in meetings and gatherings with various individuals, leaving the administrative and internal affairs to Qaani.

Although the Qods Force—part of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)—comprises different components and ranks known as Units 400, 340, 12,000, and 700, among others, each has tasks in different geographical areas and dimensions. Qaani was also present in this council as the deputy commander of the Qods Force.

However, Qasem Soleimani acted like a spiritual father in networks akin to a mafia head; many of these networks do not fall under the ranks of the Qods Force. Therefore, when Qaani took over, many of these groups had no prior connection with him and knew little about him. Qaani likewise did not have significant field knowledge of these groups given his experience focusing primarily on internal affairs.

The situation does not appear to have improved significantly since Qaani only meets proxy leaderships within a certain framework and in a very formal atmosphere, which has caused the relations between him and the groups affiliated with Iran in the region to cool down. Instead, proxy leaderships often now prefer to interact with those people who were close to Soleimani—especially the Unit 400 whose members compete with Qaani within the organization.

Qasem Soleimani was afflicted with an illusion of power and believed that no one would attempt to kill him because the cost would be too high."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

MADRID – In recent days, various Western and regional media outlets have raised questions regarding the whereabouts of Ismail Qaani, the head of the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force. 

Recently, the news agency Reuters, known for its history of false reporting concerning Iran, published an article claiming that after the Israeli attacks in Beirut, which resulted in the deaths of Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian General Abbas Nilforoushan, “contact with Ismail Qaani has been lost.”

Meanwhile, the Qatari-funded outlet Middle East Eye provided a more elaborate version in an article labeled as an "exclusive," published on October 10 on its website. Iran International, a Persian-language outlet linked to the Zionist regime and covertly directed by Manouchehr Amir, a former director of Radio Israel, cited an "informed source" claiming that Commander Qaani's family also had no news regarding his whereabouts or what he was doing.

Additionally, Sky News published a supposed detailed report stating that Qaani had suffered a heart attack during an interrogation and was receiving treatment. According to this version, "close sources" to Sky News were unaware of the commander’s current condition following the incident.

Finally, the Saudi channel Al Arabiya questioned, “Why is there no news about Commander Qaani? Where is Commander Qaani?”

From the Islamic Republic, various explanations have been provided regarding the state of the Quds Force commander. On October 7, a high-ranking official from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed that General Qaani was in good health. Moreover, the same official indicated that Qaani had issued a message to commemorate the anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

Content: "A close associate of Soleimani and a prominent figure in the Quds Force, Qaani has played a key role in strengthening the Resistance Axis in the region, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.

_Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, attends the opening ceremony of Iran’s 12th parliament in Tehran, Iran, May 27, 2024. The IRGC has yet to release a statement clarifying his status, and no new photos or videos of him have been published.

_A report suggesting Esmail Qaani’s presence at a Hezbollah meeting targeted by an Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut. Qaani’s possible death:**

Iran International claimed that Esmail Qaani might have been killed by the Israeli military, though this was denied by media outlets close to the IRGC.

A speculative report on Qaani’s possible death in an Israeli military operation by Iran International. Hezbollah’s lack of information:**

The outlet also claimed that Hezbollah did not have any information about Qaani’s situation.

_Claims that Hezbollah has no knowledge of Esmail Qaani’s current statuation. Moreover, the Quds Force’s deputy commander recently stated at a ceremony that Qaani was in good health and actively carrying out his duties.

Ultimately, all these rumors and false scenarios were fully debunked when Esmail Qaani attended the funeral of General Niloofar in person today. His participation in the funeral made it clear that the opposition media’s fabrications were baseless and that the truth had been revealed.

**WANA (Oct 15) –** Over the past two weeks, anti-Islamic Republic media outlets and opposition-linked networks, such as Iran International, have attempted to mislead public opinion in Iran, the Resistance Axis, and even globally through various fabrications about Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force. It appears that these efforts are part of Israel’s psychological operations against the Resistance Axis, involving the dissemination of false information.

Esmail Qaani was appointed as the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in 2019 after the assassination of Qassem Soleimani. One official said Qaani was in southern Beirut during the Israeli attack but was not meeting with Hashem Safieddine.

_Reuters claims that communication with Qaani was lost following Israeli strikes in Lebanon. A source informed Iran International that his family members did not know of his whereabouts.

Iranian Commander Esmail Qaani Refutes Death Rumors with Public Appearance
==========================================================================

! <image:12387>

Tehran, MINA – Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, made a public appearance in Tehran on Monday, refuting rumors that he had been killed in an Israeli airstrike.

Footage released by Iran’s _Tasnim News Agency_ shows Qaani attending a public rally celebrating what officials described as “Iran’s victory over the Zionist regime.” The event drew a large crowd in the capital.

“General Qaani participated in today’s gathering with the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” Tasnim said in a post on X.

Iran’s English-language broadcaster, Press TV, also aired the footage, reporting that Qaani was greeted with applause and chants by an enthusiastic crowd.

His appearance comes after The New York Times reported that Qaani may have been among the senior Iranian officials killed in an Israeli operation targeting Iranian military infrastructure in the region.

While Iranian authorities have not formally responded to the international media reports, Qaani’s public appearance appears intended to dispel the speculation surrounding his status. <image:12435>

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10252> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:10252>)
geolocate(<image:10252>)
web_search("Esmail Qaani hijab disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10252>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force. One article from IranWire ([https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/)) mentions Qaani's disappearance and last known location.

Another article from The New Arab ([https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-quds-forces-qaani-good-health-following-death-claims)) states that Qaani is in good health. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) provides information about Qaani and includes a picture of him <image:1>. The image <image:10252>

## Elaboration
The evidence does not confirm the claim. The reverse image search did not provide any information. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results confirm Esmail Qaani's existence and provide some information about him, but do not mention anything about him disguising himself in a hijab. The Wikipedia article provides a picture of Qaani, which does not match the person in the image.

Therefore, there is insufficient information to verify the claim.

The Washington Institute also published an article discussing Qaani's leadership struggles, including a picture of him <image:1>

Vote on a Draft Resolution on the War in Gaza\*
===============================================

Tomorrow morning (20 November), the Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the [war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question/)
, which was put forward by the Council’s ten elected members (E10). (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. The remaining 14 members voted in favour.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

A draft resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza failed to pass in the UN Security Council on Wednesday after the United States cast its veto – blocking the initiative backed by all ten elected members of the Council.

The text, co-sponsored by Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, and Somalia – collectively known as the E-10 – received 14 votes in favour, with the US casting the lone vote against.

As one of the council’s five permanent members, the US holds veto power – a negative vote that automatically blocks any resolution from going forward.

Had it been adopted, the draft would have demanded “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” to be respected by all parties.

Release all hostages
--------------------

The text reaffirmed the Council’s earlier call for the “**immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups**.”

The draft also expressed grave concern over the “**catastrophic humanitarian situation**” in Gaza – following months of almost total Israeli aid blockade – including the risk of famine, highlighted by recent assessments by international food security experts.

It reaffirmed the obligation of all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.

Resume flow of aid
------------------

In addition to a ceasefire, the draft resolution demanded the “**immediate and unconditional lifting of all restrictions**” on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid in Gaza, calling for safe and unhindered access for UN and humanitarian partners across the enclave.

It also urged the restoration of essential services, in accordance with humanitarian principles and prior [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 resolutions.

The text voiced support for ongoing mediation efforts led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States to revive the phased ceasefire framework outlined in resolution 2735 (2024), which envisions a permanent cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of all remains, full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza, and the start of a long-term reconstruction plan.

Draft resolution unacceptable: United States
--------------------------------------------

Speaking ahead of the vote, acting US Representative Dorothy Shea described the draft resolution as “unacceptable”.  

“US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise – it is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,” she said.

“The United States has been clear,” she continued, “we would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza.”

She added that Hamas has rejected numerous ceasefire proposals, including one over the weekend that would have provided a pathway to end the conflict and release the remaining hostages.

“We cannot allow the Security Council to award Hamas’ intransigence,” Ms. As Secretary \[Marco\] Rubio has said: ‘If an ember survives, it will spark again into a fire’.” 

‘The world is watching’
-----------------------

The failure of the resolution comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with UN agencies warning of the total collapse of health services, growing displacement, and a rising death toll around the new privatized US-Israel led aid distribution system which bypasses established agencies.

“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” said UN relief chief Tom Fletcher earlier on Wednesday.

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")
 [Woodrow Wilson](/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")
 decided to rely primarily on conscription, rather than voluntary enlistment, to raise military manpower for [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")
 when only 73,000 volunteers enlisted out of the initial 1 million target in the first six weeks of the war.[\[17\]](#cite_note-17)
 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")
, who proposed raising a volunteer division, which would have upstaged Wilson. However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")

 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)
 The Gates Commission issued its report in February 1970, describing how adequate military strength could be maintained without having conscription.[\[71\]](#cite_note-evans-71)
[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php)) discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza, with the US expected to vote on it. The UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164056](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164056)) reports on a US veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war)) details US support for Israel, including military aid and vetoes of ceasefire resolutions. The provided sources do not mention the US reinstituting the draft. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results focus on the US's involvement in the Israel-Hamas war through diplomatic actions and military aid, but they do not mention the reinstitution of the draft.

The Security Council Report and UN News articles discuss the US's role in the conflict, including voting on resolutions. Wikipedia provides information on US support for Israel. None of these sources mention a draft.

To verify the claim, information about a potential draft would be needed.

August 8, 2024

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)
 Selective Service System registration for men on their 18th birthdays coupled with debate that the current all-male registration should be [expanded](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4730560-senate-democrats-require-women-draft/)
 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)

\-era [draft](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-military-draft-rumors-swirl-after-iran-attacks-1865063)
. At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)
 among an apathetic American populace.

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding.
    
    Nick Schifrin is in New York now and joins us with more.
    
    So, Nick, what's in this proposal and could it be accepted by both sides?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    Well, Geoff, as you said, Israel has accepted this proposal, which would be a 60-day cease-fire of the war in Gaza. We call on President Trump to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas.
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    There are American and Israeli officials, Geoff, who do believe and tell me that if President Trump were to publicly pressure Netanyahu to end the war, Netanyahu would agree.
    
    But, for now, until Hamas agrees to this draft we have been talking about or Israel changes its policy and agrees to end the war in full, the war goes on.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Nick Schifrin in New York tonight.
    
    Nick, thank you for that reporting.

Nick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent. The deal would pause the war for 60 days, but not permanently end it, as Hamas is demanding. Hamas would also return the bodies of 18 dead Israeli hostages.
    
    In exchange, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian detainees, including more than 100 serving life sentences. But so long as the war continues, Israel's military vows to take over 75 percent of Gaza, pushing Gazans into small areas in the south, what Israel, Geoff, calls sterile zones.
    
*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    And how is Israel responding to the cease-fire proposal?
    
*   **Nick Schifrin:**
    
    As we have discussed multiple times, Geoff, Israeli society is split. You see there some scuffled with police last night after they broke into the ruling Likud headquarters.
    
    And thousands of Israelis continue to fill Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to listen to hostage families argue that diplomacy is the only way forward. They may contain errors._

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Today, Israel said it accepted a new draft of a U.S. But this would not, as you said, end the war or require Israel to withdraw from Gaza."

The US has blocked a Gaza ceasefire draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council - the fourth time it has used its veto power during the conflict to shield its ally, Israel.

Fourteen of the 15 Council members voted in favour of the draft, which demanded that the war in Gaza "must end immediately, unconditionally and permanently and all remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released".

Deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, said the document "abandoned" the necessity for there to be "a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of hostages".

Critics of the veto sharply rebuked the US, with France saying it "deeply regretted" the move.

The UNSC is composed of five permanent members which have veto power - and 10 which are elected.

This group proposed the draft resolution which also "rejected any effort to starve Palestinians".

The vote was held as the UN warned that Palestinians were "facing diminishing conditions for survival" in parts of northern Gaza under siege by Israeli forces because [virtually no aid has been delivered in 40 days](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3ypxd3p4eo)
.

Earlier this month, a UN-backed assessment said there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent in areas of northern Gaza.

The Israeli military has said its six-week-long offensive targets regrouping Hamas fighters, and that it is facilitating civilian evacuations and supply deliveries to hospitals.

Ambassador Wood said passing the resolution would have sent a "dangerous message" to Hamas, the armed group at war with Israel, that "there's no need to come back to the negotiating table".

Israel's UN ambassador, Danny Danon, said the resolution "was not a path to peace, it was a roadmap to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed".

"Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto," he added.

Hamas, meanwhile, accused the US of being "directly responsible" for Israel's "genocidal war" in Gaza.

Reacting to the veto, China's ambassador said people could not help but ask: "Do Palestinian lives mean nothing?"

France said international humanitarian law was being trampled and the only response should have been an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

The UK said it wanted to end the war, stop the suffering in Gaza and secure the immediate release of all hostages.

But the harshest criticism of the US came from outside the Council doors.

Human Rights Watch's (HRW) UN director, Louis Charbonneau, accused Washington of "once again" using its veto power "to ensure impunity for Israel as its forces continue to commit crimes against Palestinians in Gaza".

Israel rejects the accusations.

The current war broke out after Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities, killing about 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and taking 251 into Gaza as hostages.

More than 43,920 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
