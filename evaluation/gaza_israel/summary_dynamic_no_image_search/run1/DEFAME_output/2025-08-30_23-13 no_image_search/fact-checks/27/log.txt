Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on April 5, 2025, discussing rallies planned by both far-right and left-wing parties in France following Marine Le Pen's conviction. The article mentions Le Pen's conviction for embezzlement and the subsequent calls for demonstrations. <image:10794>, <image:10793>.

The claim '<image:10215> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as evidenced by sources like a [Vanity Fair article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market) and a [World Jewish Congress article](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017). The image is not related to the French parliamentary elections or Le Pen's victory.

So, the overall veracity is: false
