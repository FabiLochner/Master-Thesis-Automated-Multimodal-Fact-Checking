‘How can anyone be allowed to paint a swastika on the statue of Marianne, the goddess of French liberty, in the very center of the Place de la République?”

That was what the chairman of one of France’s most celebrated luxury brands was thinking last July, when a tall man in a black shirt and a kaffiyeh leapt to the ledge of Marianne’s pedestal and scrawled a black swastika. All around him, thousands of angry demonstrators were swarming the square with fake rockets, Palestinian and Hamas flags, even the black-and-white banners of ISIS. Here, barely a mile and a half from the Galeries Lafayette, the heart of bourgeois Paris, the chants: “MORT AUX JUIFS! MORT AUX JUIFS!” Death to the Jews. It was Saturday, July 26, 2014, and a pro-Palestinian demonstration turned into a day of terror in one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of the city.

“Do something! Do you see what is happening here?” the chairman said to a line of police officers watching the demonstration build to a frenzy. “What do you expect us to do?” one officer said, then looked away. For years, the chairman, a longtime anti-racism activist, has turned up at rallies like this one to see which politicians and which radical groups were present. (For reasons of personal safety, the chairman asked not to be identified for this story.) France’s endless demonstrations are a mainstay of the republic, a sacred right rooted in the legacy of Voltaire. But hate speech is a criminal offense—people may express their opinions, but not to the extent of insulting others based on their race, religion, or sex. The protest—against Israel’s Gaza policies—had been banned by the government, fearful of violence, following flare-ups in the preceding weeks. But if the police were to move in too quickly, the riots might continue all summer long—suburbs in flames, mobs in central Paris.

Photographs and videos of the swastika and its perpetrator, of protesters chanting “Kill the Jews,” and of the Palestinian, Hamas, and ISIS flags were sent in a rush to various groups in the Jewish community who assess threats. By early afternoon, some of these reached Sammy Ghozlan, a 72-year-old retired police commissioner who has spent his career working the _banlieues,_ the belt of working-class, racially mixed suburbs that surround Paris. Ghozlan is a folk hero of the _banlieues_ and has a nickname that is impossible to forget: _le poulet cacher_—“the kosher chicken.” (_Poulet_ is slang for cop.) For 15 years, he has overseen France’s National Bureau for Vigilance Against Anti-Semitism—known by its French abbreviation, B.N.V.C.A.—a community hotline he founded that is funded by his police pension and whatever small donations he can come by. Its purpose is nothing less than to protect the Jews of France.

This past year, Ghozlan’s frequent bulletins—detailing attacks in parks, schools attacked, synagogues torched, assaults on the Métro—have clogged the in-boxes of reporters at _Le Monde, Le Figaro,_ and _Le Parisien,_ and of thousands of Jews throughout the _banlieues._ Ghozlan’s bulletins sometimes come twice a day, with claims that have also been backed up by hard numbers: according to a watchdog group, the Jewish Community Protection Service, or S.P.C.J., which reports statistics collected by the country’s Interior Ministry, there were 851 recorded anti-Semitic incidents in France in 2014, more than doubling the total from 2013. Ghozlan and his 19 volunteers are on the front lines in the most troubled areas, documenting, trying to confirm, hoping to get a reporter or a police prefect or a court to take action. There has been such an uptick, and such a flurry of alerts from Ghozlan over the past year, that there’s always a risk that his efforts will be shrugged off as yet another nuisance.

Just two weeks before the July 26 riot, Ghozlan’s texts and messages did not stop. It was Bastille Day weekend, and, on Sunday, July 13, he tracked the hundreds of protesters who rushed into the Marais, Paris’s historic Jewish quarter, stopping briefly at an empty synagogue on the Rue des Tournelles, near the Place des Vosges, and then racing, reportedly with iron bars, axes, and flags, toward the Rue de la Roquette, a boutique-and-café-lined street a few blocks from the apartment of Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Their destination was the Don Isaac Abravanel synagogue. Inside, the 200 worshippers—including the chief rabbi of Paris—heard the howls from the crowd, estimated to number about 300: “Hitler was right!” “Jews, get out of France!” Audrey Zenouda, a policewoman who happened to be inside the synagogue, called her father, a retired policeman who works with Ghozlan at the B.N.V.C.A. “Do something. We are terrified here.”

“I knew that if anyone could get the police to take action it would be Sammy and the B.N.V.C.A.,” Zenouda later told me. Only six police officers were assigned to be on demonstration duty that day. “We are waiting for the assault police to arrive,” one told a reporter at the scene. After an hour, a counterterrorism force rescued the chief rabbi, but everyone else was left inside, behind doors barricaded from the inside with chairs and tables. Outside, members of a special security patrol and a dozen members of the self-trained Ligue de Défense Juive began chasing off the demonstrators with chairs and tables from nearby cafés, working with a small unit from the security force. Together, it took them three hours to disperse the crowd and safely evacuate the synagogue.

Almost immediately afterward, the reports of the July 13 demonstration would be challenged and debated. The numbers would be skeptically parsed—were there really so many?—and questions would be asked about actions that might have provoked the violence, as if carrying iron bars and axes around central Paris might be normal. In some circles, there were even accusations that the Jews “brought on the behavior,” as they always do.

In the crowd—and many others that would turn the summer of 2014 into a summer of hate in Paris—were representatives of France’s political parties, both left and right. France’s Muslim population is estimated to be around 5 million, a potential voting bloc in a country of 66 million. (The Jewish population of France is in the neighborhood of 500,000.) Shimon Samuels, the director for international relations at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Paris—which combats anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and extremism, and, through a foundation, helps to fund Ghozlan’s hotline—witnessed some of the events of July 13. Among those he recognized in the crowd were a local concierge and bank teller, along with members of the current Socialist government.

Monitoring the footage later, Ghozlan was sickened to see the faces of political allies he had worked with for decades, mostly in what is known as Le Neuf Trois (“9–3”), the area of northern Paris suburbs that he once presided over as a commissioner of police. Le Neuf Trois is the rap name for this district, which has the honor of being, by reputation anyway, the most violent in France. (The name derives from the area’s postal codes, which all begin with “93.”) It is also where Ghozlan lived for 30 years in a spacious house surrounded by hedges on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in the relatively calm community of Le Blanc-Mesnil.

For Ghozlan, July 2014 was the tipping point, after years of escalating anti-Semitic violence: “There was no debate in our family. We all knew—it is time to go. Leaving is better than running away,” Ghozlan later told me. He would ultimately come to think of the summer riots as the predictors of the catastrophes that would play out six months later in the terror attacks at the offices of the satirical weekly _Charlie Hebdo,_ three quarters of a mile from the Place de la République, on January 7, 2015, and then, two days later, at Hyper Cacher, a kosher grocery store in the Porte de Vincennes neighborhood of eastern Paris.

By then Ghozlan’s classified ad—one nobody who knows him could ever have thought possible—had already been posted: “Renting a house, 4 rooms, 2 bathrooms, a veranda, a garden with 50 m. square.” Two days before the _Charlie Hebdo_ attack, Sammy announced what, to many, including me, was unthinkable: Sammy Ghozlan, proud Frenchman and the dean of Paris’s anti-Semitic crime-fighters, had joined the thousands of French Jews moving to Israel.

**The Sephardic Columbo**
-------------------------

More than a decade ago, I spent weeks with Ghozlan at the height of the second intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began in September of 2000 and lasted more than four years. Ghozlan had recently started the B.N.V.C.A. hotline and was working from a crammed back room in a synagogue in Le Pré-Saint-Gervais. When I first met him, in the fall of 2002, Ghozlan carried a white plastic binder bulging with one-page reports written up from the calls he’d received from tipsters. All day and all night his phone would ring. It never left his hand. More than 300 reports were in that binder: Molotov cocktails thrown at Jewish schools, students called _sale Juif_ (“dirty Jew”), arsons, desecrations, a Jewish woman beaten in a taxi. The attacks on the Jews of France had yet to catch the attention of the international press, and Ghozlan could get almost no one in Paris to take him seriously.

Now, 12 years later, Ghozlan’s binder is one of 50 that fill the shelves of his office in central Paris. I went to see him again last spring, when he was back in the city, having undergone surgery to repair a tendon in his leg. The B.N.V.C.A. was still operating, with Ghozlan monitoring from Netanya, a seaside town near Tel Aviv, where as many as 2,000 French Jews immigrated to in 2014, and where Ghozlan moved last December, coming back to Paris every six weeks or so.

The base of the Statue de la République is defaced with a swastika as a protest in support of Palestinians turns anti-Semitic, Paris, July 26, 2014. By Etienne Laurent/EPA/Corbis.

Ghozlan resembles a beat-up version of Yves Montand, and the decade since we had seen each other only heightened the effect. Otherwise, not much had changed. He still wears the neat blazer and open shirt that suggest his native North Africa. (He was born in Algeria.) And he was still constantly on the phone, issuing directives to investigate allegations of anti-Semitism. He dispatched volunteer lawyers to the courts to try to stop marauding anti-Israel protesters who stripped kosher and Israeli products from supermarket shelves. And he was entrenched in a longtime legal battle against the anti-Semitic, Holocaust-denying comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, who was recently convicted in Paris of condoning terrorism. “This case obsesses me,” Ghozlan told me. “I have been filing against him for 10 years.” On his iPhone, he shows me dozens of pictures of Dieudonné’s fans in front of the Hyper Cacher, after the bloody hostage crisis of January 9, making the sign of the “_quenelle,_” a Nazi-style salute that Dieudonné created and popularized.

It had been two months since that attack, and Ghozlan was fixated on trying to make sense of what had happened inside the Hyper Cacher, where a 32-year-old terrorist named Amedy Coulibaly, who had grown up in a Paris suburb with his Malian parents, massacred four people in a quiet area of bobos and professionals in Porte de Vincennes. He wore a GoPro video camera strapped to his torso to record the slaughter. He reportedly announced to his hostages: “I am Amedy Coulibaly, Malian and Muslim. I belong to the Islamic State.” By the time the siege was over, four French Jews were dead, including one young man who grabbed a gun that Coulibaly had left on a counter because it had jammed. The day before, Coulibaly had killed a policewoman who was investigating a traffic accident in the suburb of Montrouge.

When news flashed of the Montrouge shooting, Ghozlan was following the situation from Netanya. He had an instinct and contacted a close friend in another Jewish organization who lived nearby. “This morning attack in Montrouge,” he wrote. “Can you check to see if this was near the \[Jewish\] school?” The answer came: “You are right. The school is close. There are rumors, but you are wrong. We are there and the school is not the target.” Later reports indicated that a Jewish school in Montrouge may actually have been Coulibaly’s original target. In Netanya, Ghozlan had yet to unpack his furniture, but he was already making plans to get back to Paris.

Moving back permanently was out of the question, but it hasn’t been easy for Ghozlan to disconnect. “I am deeply French,” he told me. “I did my military service in the air force. I love France’s values, its culture, its history, its cuisine, philosophers, and artists. I never imagined that I would someday leave. I led the fight for 15 years and all our warnings made no difference.” In 2014, about 7,000 Jews left France for Israel, and this year the anticipated exodus is between 10,000 and 15,000. The Jewish Agency for Israel recently reported that, in 2014, 50,000 French Jews made inquiries about moving to Israel, an astonishing number. In many of France’s public lycées, Jewish students are insulted, classrooms are vandalized, books are defaced, and fights break out in the classroom with any attempt to teach the Holocaust. After the _Charlie Hebdo_ and Hyper Cacher attacks, there were reports that classes were disrupted when some Muslim students refused to participate in any memorial for the victims. According to Shimon Samuels, about 40 percent of France’s Jewish students are now in Jewish schools and 35 percent in Catholic schools. “This is an unprecedented situation,” Ghozlan tells me. “We are in new territory here.”

Ghozlan’s phone rings. When he hangs up, he tells me of two unidentified Muslim men who have swept into a Jewish school in Paris’s well-heeled 16th Arrondissement. (Earlier that week, there had been an incident at another Jewish school, in the 11th Arrondissement, an area of professionals, politicians, and writers.) “How did these thugs get into the school?” Ghozlan asks. “They walked around as if they were staking it out.” The school in the 16th was evacuated and the bomb squad deployed. None of this will appear in the press, Ghozlan says. There is a fear in the schools that they will lose more students.

Ghozlan’s voice is the first thing that commands attention—his inflection is almost musical. A part of Ghozlan’s celebrity in the _banlieues_ is his reputation as a former bandleader who played three instruments and oversaw orchestras that worked the Jewish-wedding and Bar Mitzvah circuit in Paris, advertising “Groove, Funck, Hassidiques, Israélien … Oriental.” He learned his limited English by lip-synching to Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive.”

Like 70 percent of France’s Jewish population, Ghozlan is Sephardic, part of the group from North Africa called _pieds-noirs_ (“black feet”). He lived in the Algerian city of Constantine until 1962, when, at age 20, he fled the country with his family in the wake of the Algerian war, taking with him just “a sandwich and a suitcase,” a commonly used _pied-noir_ expression. With his wife, Monique, a petite kindergarten teacher he met when they were both in a Jewish youth group in Algeria, he lived in the house in Le Blanc-Mesnil. There were bedrooms for his three daughters and one son, and his mother, who never missed an episode of _NYPD Blue._ When I first met Ghozlan, he struck me as a Sephardic Columbo. Early in his police career, he managed to negotiate order in a part of the _banlieues_ that was so violent it was nicknamed Chicago. His method was to offer judo classes to the immigrant populations—many of which spoke Arabic, as Ghozlan does. He was assigned to take care of juvenile offenders, who seemed to respond to his direct style and lack of hyperbole, which he had learned, he told me, from his father, a former chief of detectives in Constantine.

Ghozlan made his counterterrorism reputation when the synagogue on the Rue Copernic was bombed in 1980, an attack that killed 4 people and injured more than 40. Ghozlan learned that the perpetrators were Palestinian sympathizers, not the neo-Nazis the police first suspected. He was made special commissioner to investigate the next major anti-Semitic attack, on Chez Jo Goldenberg, a landmark Jewish restaurant in the Marais, where 6 people, including two Americans, were killed, and another 22 wounded, in 1982. Ghozlan’s police career—always running alongside his Bar Mitzvah shows—eventually brought him to head the department in Aulnay-sous-Bois, in Seine-Saint-Denis. He retired in 1998 and in 2000 started the B.N.V.C.A., finding himself almost alone in his fight to protect the Jews of the _banlieues._

Ghozlan has been awarded the Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest tribute. But his urgency has always made him an outlier, an annoyance to the assimilation-conscious, largely secular Jewish establishment concentrated in Paris’s preferred arrondissements, who still view him as a publicity hound from the _banlieues,_ a Jew who does not know when not to react. However noble Ghozlan’s motives, he makes a nuisance of himself with his incessant press releases, I was told a decade ago. That sentiment hasn’t changed in some quarters.

When I originally met Ghozlan, he railed that his jerry-rigged detective agency had to deal with a rigid French justice system. To register a hate crime in France—which comes with a higher level of punishment than an ordinary crime—he would have to appear in front of a magistrate, who was generally loath to call the beating of a rabbi in the Métro an act of anti-Semitism. For them, Ghozlan said, it was a “simple assault,” usually committed by an unemployed French Muslim acting out of frustration. This enraged Ghozlan. “I wanted to start a Jewish defense force,” Ghozlan told me. Judge after judge told him, “There is no anti-Semitism charge applicable unless someone dies.” The party line of the Establishment Jewish organizations in Paris was always “Sammy, stop rocking the boat.” Back then, even David de Rothschild, the banker, told _The\*\*Jerusalem Post_ that the wave of attacks was likely coming from “neo-Nazis, a hostile, aggressive, antisemitic, right-wing population … ” He soon changed his mind.

**Foreigners Again**
--------------------

Twelve years later. It feels like an eye-of-the-storm moment in Paris, as the government of François Hollande tries to restore calm after last summer’s riots and the January terror attacks, amid a faltering economy and plunging euro. When I landed, in March, the rise of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing National Front, was in the headlines, as Paris was still struggling to recover from the terrorist attacks of January. Mounds of flowers and posters could be seen on the streets. There were swirls of tourists at the Louvre, as always, but there were more soldiers with automatic weapons at every Jewish school and institution, even in the dining room of a Rothschild-foundation nursing home. In the lobby of the synagogue on Rue Copernic—the one damaged by the bomb in 1980—schoolchildren walked in proximity to machine guns. The optics were unnerving.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls—taking the risk that he might antagonize his Socialist Party base, which leans pro-Palestinian—was issuing a series of muscular statements seeking to stop the flood of Jews leaving France. Among them: anti-Zionism is “an invitation to anti-Semitism.” An increase in prejudice is “growing in an insufferable manner in our country,” he said, and pledged 100 million euros toward combating “racism and anti-Semitism.” Ten thousand soldiers were deployed throughout the country. Parts of the _banlieues_ have resembled war zones, including, at times, Créteil, east of Paris, where Valls made his pledge. Last December, Créteil endured the brutal case of a 19-year-old woman whose apartment, which she shared with her boyfriend, was broken into. One of her assailants allegedly said, “You must have cash here because you are Jews.” They then gang-raped her. In April, Valls announced that French police had foiled five terrorist attacks in recent months amid stepped-up security. One involved an Algerian who allegedly shot himself by accident and then called an ambulance. “The threat has never been so high,” Valls said. “We have never had to face this kind of terrorism in our history.” (In June, the Anti-Defamation League was preparing to release a survey suggesting that the French population has become increasingly aware of the problem of anti-Semitism.)

The former foreign minister, 92-year-old Roland Dumas, once convicted of accepting illegal gifts from a mistress who was a lobbyist for a French oil giant—the conviction was later reversed—criticized Valls, even though they are both in the Socialist Party. “He has personal alliances. That means he has prejudices. Everyone knows he is married to someone … who has influence on him,” Dumas said on a news show. Valls’s wife is the Jewish violinist Anne Gravoin. Immediately, the Wiesenthal center called on President Hollande to strip Dumas of his Légion d’Honneur, as the British designer John Galliano had been when he lashed out against the Jews. Its campaign was unsuccessful.

France has the largest population of Jews in Europe (and the third largest in the world, after Israel and the United States) and has always been seen as the laboratory to understand what is happening on the Continent. But Jews make up less than 1 percent of the French population. Even so, according to the S.P.C.J., they are the target of 51 percent of all racist acts in France. The country has become Israel’s biggest source of immigrants.

There are those who question the dire statistics. “Can you believe that a philanthropist from New York was here last week and told us he had come to offer us humanitarian aid?” said Sacha Reingewirtz, the president of the Union of French Jewish Students, which won a court case against Twitter in 2013, forcing Twitter to identify authors of anti-Semitic tweets in France. Reingewirtz, with degrees from Oxford and the Sorbonne, tries to minimize the fact that swastikas have appeared on university campuses. The Jews of the Paris establishment have long lived a form of double life; religion in France is traditionally a private matter. “There is still a sense of downplay among the upper middle class,” said the author Clémence Boulouque, a former literary critic for _Le Figaro_ who now lives in New York. “There is a sense of pride. There is a reluctance to share our feelings and fears.”

It’s precisely this attitude that Ghozlan has been battling for decades, one that is fiercely resilient given the current mood in Paris. The country’s counterterrorism forces are now desperately trying to cope with what is commonly called the “third wave of anti-Semitism” in modern France. The first wave, coming from the far right, morphed into the neo-Nazi crusades of the 1990s, which targeted not only France’s Jews but also the growing Muslim population isolated in projects on the outskirts of the cities. The second wave came from the far left—rooted in pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel attitudes—and erupted during the first and second intifadas, with flare-ups in the 1990s and early 2000s. The third wave has been propelled by the recent rise of ISIS, has metastasized via thousands of Web sites and social media, and, in France, has become homegrown and home-schooled among a vulnerable population of young Muslims. One Jewish-American expat, living with his young family in a quiet part of Le Neuf Trois, just over the Boulevard Périphérique from Montmartre, told me, “It can feel like there are two choices for a young man in the projects: sell drugs or turn to Islam.”

French Muslims who are as assimilated as French Jews speak privately of suddenly being trapped into the identity of Islam, whether they are religious or not. Sartre once wrote of the Jews, “It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew.” The same can be said about Muslims, as the documentary-film maker and novelist Karim Miské—who was born in Ivory Coast and was not brought up Muslim—wrote in _Le Monde:_ “It is the Islamophobe who makes the Muslim.” Recently, Miské, winner of an English PEN award for his novel _Arab Jazz,_ set in the checkerboard world of the 19th Arrondissement, was in the Marais with his 12-year-old daughter when a well-dressed man looked at him menacingly and said, “Boom.” “The tragedy is that we are now trapped in an identification with religion,” he told me. “Frankly, it is racist.”

I went to visit a Jewish family in the Sixth Arrondissement, where life is as assimilated and as privileged as it gets for Jews in Paris. The 18-year-old daughter, a high-school senior making plans to attend university in England, asked me, “Is it true that if I lived in America I could wear a tiny Star of David necklace or a sweatshirt from Technion university?”

“What would happen if you wore it in this neighborhood?” I asked. “Do you think you would be physically attacked?”

“I would be made to feel _angoisse,_” she said, meaning uncomfortable, filled with anxiety or angst. This teenager was certain there would be looks and harassment, perhaps even a physical altercation. I heard the word _angoisse_ frequently in Paris. However established you have been as a Jew in France, I was told, you no longer have the luxury of feeling invisible. It is as if the Jews of France are being forced yet again into a ghetto of cultural identification. This, despite France’s profound traditions of liberty, equality, and fraternity, not to mention _laïcité_—the stubborn commitment to strict secularism. As a member of an established Jewish family recently told the _Telegraph_ columnist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, “When did we become foreigners again?”

**“No One Else Will Die”**
--------------------------

On the ninth of January, the day of the Hyper Cacher attack in Porte de Vincennes, the sirens of Paris did not stop. Ghozlan’s niece, a lawyer, was on her way to the Hyper Cacher when she ran into a friend just outside the store. It was one P.M. They stopped to talk. Suddenly, a muscular African rushed past her with his knapsack. He knocked her in the shoulder. A few moments later she heard gunshots. She called her uncle immediately. Ghozlan happened to know the store owner. He texted him and started calling everyone he knew in the Paris police.

Only 12 days before, on December 28, Ghozlan had had an ominous feeling and sent out another of his warnings: “The next attack is going to come at an unguarded Jewish business or store. The B.N.V.C.A. demands 24/7 security on Jewish stores.” An associate told him, “You are going too far, Sammy.”

In news reports of the Hyper Cacher attack, one man is called the Unidentified Hostage. I met him in Paris in March, several weeks before French judges placed a gag order on the hostages. His story has never been told publicly. In the five hours that Coulibaly held 19 people hostage, André, as he insists on being called, was the only one alone with the attacker for long stretches of time. When he was finally rescued with the other surviving hostages, he spent hours briefing the counterterrorism squad, was congratulated for his sangfroid, drafted a 10-page statement, and met Prime Minister Valls at a reception. Soon after, André took leave from work, afraid for his life.

André is 43, a computer tech with clients that include law firms and banks. He is Jewish, but non-observant, and does not keep kosher. He had heard of Sammy Ghozlan but never paid particular attention to the B.N.V.C.A. Like everyone in Paris, he was badly shaken by the terrorist attack at the offices of _Charlie Hebdo,_ and on Friday, January 9, he and his girlfriend made the decision to stay in for the weekend. The Hyper Cacher is known for its appetizers—tabbouleh, hummus, freshly prepared every day. Moments after they entered the shop to buy some snacks for the weekend, they heard gunshots and raced downstairs to the basement with others to hide. A few minutes later, a fellow customer rushed down and told them, “He will kill us all if you do not come up.” André and his girlfriend followed a group upstairs to a scene of bodies, blood pooling on the floor, and an angry Coulibaly: “Does anyone here know anything about computers?”

For André, the smooth-faced African was obviously “a boy of the _banlieues._” He was struck by what seemed to be a split in Coulibaly’s personality. He seemed equal parts insecure student and newly trained terrorist, as if he were taking cues from the ISIS playbook, which inspires working-class would-be jihadists to morph into monsters capable of beheading. “It is a form of empowerment,” André said. It became clear to André that, for all his training, Coulibaly did not possess the tech skills needed to perform what was evidently an essential task: the uploading of his GoPro footage of the carnage, in which four people were slaughtered in the first moments of the attack. “He needed it for instant replay on jihadi sites,” André said. Just as urgently, Coulibaly wanted to get online to monitor the news. “What was urgent is that his footage was expected to be uploaded while he was in the store to incite other attacks in Paris.”

Coulibaly had raced into the store with at least one Kalashnikov rifle, a Scorpion submachine gun, two Tokarev pistols, knives, ammunition, and a silver laptop, with instructions on how to upload his footage and what to say to the news media. What he did not bring, however, was any equipment to make it work without Wi-Fi. The Hyper Cacher had no Wi-Fi. In addition, Coulibaly forgot to bring his charger cord, and his laptop was running out of power. In the office of the small store, his frustration was mounting. “He was desperate to get online,” André said. André volunteered to help. For the next five hours, he was in and out of the office of the Hyper Cacher as Coulibaly ricocheted between rage and calm. At one point, Coulibaly questioned the hostages and learned that André had never been inside the Hyper Cacher before. “Wow, that is bad luck,” Coulibaly said.

André is a slight man, with delicate hands and large expressive eyes. It was easy to understand how Coulibaly would not have found him threatening. His size, however, masked his physical strength and discipline. On the day we met, he wore purple suede running shoes and a gray silk scarf knotted around his neck. His first task was to get Coulibaly online. “Are you sure you know what you are doing?” Coulibaly said, and hovered over him with the guns. “I just focused,” André said. “I told him what I was doing as I was doing it. And at all times I called him ‘mister,’ and I used the formal _vous,_ as a way of showing my respect. I wanted to keep him calm. I knew that already he had killed four people, and I made it my mission: No one else will die. ‘We don’t need Wi-Fi,’ I told him. ‘I can get you online.’ ” André grabbed a cable from the Hyper Cacher’s printer, used it to connect Coulibaly’s laptop to the store’s Internet hookup, and opened a Web browser on Coulibaly’s desktop. He could have used an application that would have left no footprint—like Tails, the choice of Edward Snowden—but a browser, André knew, is easily trackable.

Soon, the news was up on the three channels Coulibaly had requested, France 24, Canal+, and BFMTV, the country’s leading news network, which Coulibaly was determined to contact. André remained near him. “Connect me to the newsdesk,” Coulibaly snapped, but he kept his laptop angled so André could not see directly onto the screen. What he did manage to see was a complex set of instructions that Coulibaly had downloaded and was trying to follow. On the telephone finally with BFMTV, Coulibaly began to free-associate a rambling statement about his mission to avenge the Prophet and kill the Jews. When he hung up, he continued to speak to André, and, from time to time, others in the store. He allowed the hostages to have lunch. “I will serve you,” André said, which angered Coulibaly. “I have not given you that order,” Coulibaly said.

Some of what Coulibaly talked about that day was tracked by authorities when they were able to monitor a Samsung Galaxy phone Coulibaly had borrowed from one customer, but much was not. To André, he admitted that he had killed the policewoman in Montrouge and that he was working with Cherif and Said Kouachi, the brothers responsible for the _Charlie Hebdo_ massacre. “He said, ‘There are many people like me who are now preparing in Arab countries.’ He told me, and others too, ‘I am not crazy. We understand the Koran. We understand the good and the right way.’ ” Coulibaly’s French sounded unsophisticated to André, without subjunctives. On the telephone, however, with French media, he spoke a more academic French, as if he had been tutored with a formal script.

What André never revealed to Coulibaly was that, in his early career, he had, in fact, been a teacher in a very tough suburb. “It was a different France then,” he told me. “In the 1990s we had no problems. I had students that reminded me of Coulibaly. They were operating out of the system. We were trained in how to work with them.” The first step, he said, was to always show them respect. “I knew to listen and not to argue. I knew, ‘Do not use the familiar _tu_—that only came at the end.’ I used the word _vous_ until he began saying ‘_tu_’ to me.”

André did not tell Coulibaly another essential fact of his life. On the roster of his tech clients were some with high security clearances at foreign embassies. From a cold-storage room in the basement of the Hyper Cacher, he had texted his contacts. The French counterterrorism squad still has his phone, he said, but André re-created a version of what he sent: “It is very urgent. There is a terrorist attack at Hyper Cacher. He has already killed.” He noticed that he had only two bars on his own Samsung Galaxy and worried that it would not go through. He quickly sent another: “I am downstairs in the refrigerator room.” And one more: “I am in the Hyper Cacher of Porte de Vincennes. There is someone with a weapon and he has already killed.”

Several times that afternoon, Coulibaly, finally calm, asked André, “Do you understand why I am doing what I am doing? Do you understand what I am doing here? I am here because the Prophet has given me an order. I am here to stop the war in the Arab countries.”

“I said, ‘I can understand what you are saying.’ I went into a neutral state, like a teacher. I wanted him to see into my eyes and know that I was not angry. I said, ‘I am here and I will try to help you.’ ” He was, André believed, hoping for a glimmer of mutually understood truth or to hear perhaps the ultimate French compliment of agreement: _exactement!_

Reliving it, André starts to tremble slightly. He has been in therapy since January, as has his girlfriend, who still cannot get on the Métro. His fear is that he will be identified, and his life will be threatened. “Again and again he said, ‘This is not my fault. I have to do this. It is not against you personally.’ He wanted me to acknowledge in some way his point of view. And what had brought him to what he had to do. He needed to be understood.”

**Au Revoir, Paris**
--------------------

The most troubling question in the French Jewish community is also the most obvious one: “Is it time to leave?”

I asked Roger Cukierman, the head of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions Juives de France, or CRIF, the umbrella group for secular Jewish organizations in France. I expected him to equivocate, but, by way of an answer, he quickly reeled off some of the horrors that have plagued the Jews of Europe during the last decade: the case of Ilan Halimi, a cell-phone salesman kidnapped, brutally tortured, and killed in the Paris suburbs by a gang in 2006 for being Jewish; the 2012 murders of three small children and one adult at point-blank range at the Ozar Hatorah school, in Toulouse, by Mohamed Merah; the 2014 slaughter at the Brussels Jewish Museum; the deadly attack at the synagogue in Copenhagen in February of this year. This March, Merah’s stepbrother was pictured in the _New York Post_ in his camouflage ISIS togs pronouncing a death sentence, as a pre-pubescent boy beside him pulled the trigger in the videotaped execution of the 19-year-old Israeli Arab Muhamed Musalam. Then there are the riots. As Cukierman told _The Telegraph_ last summer, “They are not screaming ‘Death to the Israelis’ on the streets of Paris. They are screaming ‘Death to the Jews.’ ”

To get a better idea of why Ghozlan decided to leave, I went to visit his friend and colleague Yossi Malka, a retired businessman who works for the B.N.V.C.A. Malka met me at the commuter rail station at Stains, a suburb in Le Neuf Trois. If you didn’t know better, you could be in parts of Queens or the Bronx. Here are the same gray projects, laundry flung over the balconies.

Malka wore a worn brown leather jacket, a natty tie, and a fedora—what I think of as the uniform of the _banlieues_—and drove me to Sarcelles, 20 minutes away and part of what is called the Red Belt, a string of suburban towns, many with Communist or Socialist mayors historically but, now, an expanding National Front. “This is not the Paris of Woody Allen,” Malka told me as we approached a small synagogue ringed by low apartment buildings topped with satellite dishes. “That Paris no longer exists.”

Sarcelles, which borders Le Neuf Trois, is an extended area of small apartment houses, shopping centers, projects, and markets, the first stop for middle-class Moroccans, Algerians, and Tunisians, who, like Ghozlan’s family, immigrated to France in the 1960s. For decades these neighborhoods were peaceful, a vibrant mix of French citizens and immigrants, all trying to make their way in a country with little regard for their special identities.

“Welcome to the most endangered synagogue in France,” Malka said as we entered a small driveway in Garges-lès-Gonesse, a suburb next to Sarcelles. “Look at that,” he said, pointing out through the windshield. “All day, they throw things—melons, garbage, rocks, and bottles.” Parked in front was a large silver van from France’s counterterrorism force, Vigipirate.

In Garges last July, a week after the violence on the Rue de la Roquette, a highly visible billboard advertising lollipops was modified with a large scrawl: PALESTINE WILL LIVE, PALESTINE WILL OVERCOME. COME WITH: MORTAR, FIRE EXTINGUISHER, BATON. DEMONSTRATION AT THE GARGES-SARCELLES TRAIN STATION. COME OUT IN NUMBERS! FOLLOW TO THE JEWISH QUARTER.

French authorities took action, and the pro-Palestinian demonstrations planned for the weekend, which clearly promised another wave of anti-Semitic violence, were forbidden. Yet nothing was done to stop them. On Saturday, July 19, thousands appeared in and around Paris, burning cars, attacking buses. By two P.M. the next day, a mob of hundreds crowded the narrow street by the Garges synagogue, and the first rocks had shattered the Star of David window. Hammers were taken to the lock at the gate; the marks were still visible when I visited in March. The police refused to move in. Ghozlan was alerted immediately but could hardly hear over what had become the standard rallying cry: “MORT AUX JUIFS!” Their next destination: the shopping center in Sarcelles and its large synagogue, two blocks away, another stop on Malka’s grim tour.

Ghozlan sent out a blast via text message: “Big emergency in Sarcelles. Stores are being attacked. Synagogue is being held by demonstrators. Police are not going in Sarcelles.” Within the hour, a pharmacy was in flames. Then hundreds raced through the central plaza toward a Jewish market and that too went up in flames. Then on to the synagogue. Ghozlan was furiously texting for every member of the Ligue de Défense Juive in the area to get to the synagogue and protect it, while advising the general public to “stay out of Sarcelles.”

News footage showed French police standing inert for almost two hours until reinforcements arrived with tear gas. (The previous day, the police had used tear gas and made 38 arrests.) With the help of the Ligue, they were able to push back the mob. Later, they would say they were waiting for authorization: France’s police are under strict instructions not to intervene without actual threats of violence. When the young people of the synagogue came outside, they began to sing “La Marseillaise” to thank the police for their rescue. Standing in the crowd, Malka saw several French police officers crying. “This should not be happening ever again in France,” one of them told Malka. Earlier that afternoon, Prime Minister Valls had laid a wreath during a commemoration of the 72nd anniversary of the roundup that sent more than 13,000 Jews from Paris to the Nazi death camps.

When I asked Ghozlan about this day, his eyes moistened. “I relived my childhood. In Algeria, the French said they would protect us. Then the mobs came and torched Jewish businesses and we had to flee.”

The first things Ghozlan packed last November were his musical instruments, two violins and a piano. Then he sorted through hundreds of family photographs and letters. He shipped a Louis XVI commode and a writing desk but left most of the furniture for the tenants, an immigrant family who were the first to answer the ad for the house on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil that Ghozlan had built in the 1970s. Today, few of the Ghozlans’ Jewish neighbors remain; two-thirds of the members of his synagogue down the street have departed. His three daughters have already moved to Israel.

Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, in a still from a video he recorded before the Hyper Cacher attack. From Polaris.

What surprised many was Ghozlan’s determination to leave. He resisted encouragement from a friend and neighbor, Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam of Drancy, who moved to that suburban town, the next one over from Le Blanc-Mesnil, from Tunisia in 1996. He has been an ally of Ghozlan’s for most of the past decade, attending his rollicking Shabbat dinners and hosting Ghozlan for lunches at his mosque. “I told him again and again, ‘You cannot leave,’ ” Chalghoumi told me. “Sammy would not engage in the conversation.”

Chalghoumi is tall and commanding, with an exuberant personality. “The world changed on 9/11,” he said. “At the airport I am often pulled out of the lines.” But the imam reacted strongly when I referred to “Islamophobia.” “I will not use that word,” he said. “That plays into a sense of victimization.”

Chalghoumi gave a speech at the Shoah Memorial in Drancy in 2006. Not long after, his house was vandalized, the contents damaged or destroyed. At a prayer service in 2009, Chalghoumi talked about the need to respect the Jews and their centuries of culture. The next day, around 200 protesters collected outside his mosque, confronting anyone who tried to enter. Many of the protesters waved signs: PUPPET OF THE JEWS. With members of a Jewish organization, he toured Israel with 20 imams in 2012. When he returned, there was a mass of demonstrators at the airport. In 2013, he was in Tunisia with his family when he was assaulted near a mosque. His daughters were with him and have yet to get over it. He spent days in the hospital.

I met Chalghoumi in a private room at a Hilton, given to him, he said, by “Jewish friends”—the hotel owners. With him were three bodyguards. His next appointment was with the grand rabbi of Brussels, and soon, Chalghoumi said, he would be on his way back to Israel. His phone rings as frequently as Ghozlan’s. One of the calls that day was from someone informing the imam that the French government would start shutting down a few Islamist Web sites that were advocating terrorism. “Bravo,” he said. “It’s a start.”

He pulled out his iPhone and showed me dozens of racist sites, many naming him as a target. Suddenly, I heard shouts from the speaker. The images on the screen were of demonstrators massed against him in Drancy. The problem in France, Chalghoumi believes, “is the foreign funding of mosques where imams are often imported from Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Why won’t the government put a stop to it? No one is monitoring what is going on. All of the imams here should be trained in France.”

When Ghozlan was in the hospital, Chalghoumi made sure to visit—the only one of his friends, Ghozlan later told me, who made the effort. The imam thinks he might still have a shot at getting his friend to move back to Paris. “I am not giving up,” he told me. “I am going to make him change his mind.”

Throughout the second half of 2014, Ghozlan and the B.N.V.C.A. were in overdrive amid a flurry of new reports: signs in Le Neuf Trois that said, HITLER WAS RIGHT; a 16-year-old Jewish student hospitalized when four Africans jumped him; groups making Nazi salutes at the Shoah Memorial; the robbery and rape in Créteil. A new white plastic binder had to be started.

On Christmas Day, Ghozlan received word that an air rifle had been fired at a kosher fast-food restaurant in the 19th Arrondissement, just a few days after a synagogue had been similarly attacked. Then, the following day, a nearby synagogue and a printer’s shop. Ghozlan insisted on cranking out a press release. Then he sent out the alert predicting further attacks on Jewish stores, 12 days before Coulibaly entered the Hyper Cacher.

On that January day, the chairman of the luxury-goods company who witnessed the defacing of Marianne with a swastika last July got a hysterical phone call from his daughter. She had learned on Facebook that one of her father’s cousins was trapped inside the store. Her father was already in a garage off the Champs-Élysées, getting on his motorcycle to try to get through the police lines in Porte de Vincennes.

Inside the office of the Hyper Cacher, Coulibaly was desperate to connect to the police. He demanded that André dial the number. Coulibaly heard the recording: “ ‘If you need this office, press 1. If you need that office, press 2,’ ” André told me. “Coulibaly said, ‘What bullshit. Nothing in this country works.’ ” He had managed to get through to French TV but was still having other problems. He needed to upload his GoPro footage, but, André said, “his program was a very old Adobe Flash Player. Maybe if the Flash Player would have been working, I would never have been in that office all that time. At one point, he asked all of us our names and religion. And what we did for a living. I said, ‘I am a handyman. That is how I know computers.’ At that moment, he took his weapon and started to load it. I thought, This is the end.”

In the Hyper Cacher office later that afternoon, André saw that Coulibaly’s upload of his seven minutes of carnage had stalled at 87 percent. Then he heard noises coming from outside. He and his girlfriend hid under the checkout counter. Coulibaly had gone to a corner of the store to pray. When the counterterrorism squad sprayed bullets into the store, Coulibaly was killed instantly. As André and the other hostages, including the luxury-company chairman’s cousin, rushed out, they were told, “Do not look to your side.” In the pandemonium, André did not notice Coulibaly’s dead body next to the checkout counter.

Nicolas Comte, the head of the Unité SGP police union, had been among the crowd earlier in the day outside the Hyper Cacher. Tall and broadly built, he resembles a TV anchor and is the face of the French police. When we spoke, he mentioned that the concerns of the Jewish community were crucial to him. “Why?” I asked. He hesitated. “I don’t tell many people, but my wife is Jewish and so are my children.” Comte is Catholic. The one time he had met Sammy Ghozlan was when Comte went to his in-laws’ synagogue in Le Blanc-Mesnil. “I knew him only from his reputation. He’s a hero of mine,” Comte said.

Like many in his situation, Comte now lives “a bit of a double life,” he said, in France. “I have told all my children, ‘Do not let anyone know you are Jewish. It is a private affair.’ But my youngest son, recently a Bar Mitzvah, insists on wearing a small Star of David. I let him know my concern. I said, ‘You must be careful.’ Now, when I go to synagogue, I have a gun that I carry in my coat pocket so no one can see it. It has come to that.”

Not long after the attack on the Hyper Cacher, representatives of the Ministry of the Interior appeared on the Avenue Henri Barbusse in Le Blanc-Mesnil. They had come to alert Ghozlan that he would now have a security detail posted at his house at all times. Ghozlan’s tenants informed them, “Mr. Ghozlan has moved from France,” and gave them his new address in Israel.

!German TV agrees to air anti-Semitism documentary following cries of censorship <image:10782>

Bds

Germany’s public broadcaster has agreed to air a new documentary on European anti-Semitism following accusations of censorship by local politicians, Jewish organizations and the State of Israel.

The ARD commissioned documentary “Chosen and Excluded – The Hate for Jews in Europe” was initially shelved for allegedly lacking balance, although the filmmakers told the Jerusalem Post that they believed that the broadcaster objected to its contention that “modern anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism.”

The movie examines the links between anti-Zionism and the BDS movement and contemporary Judeophobia and portions were filmed in Israel and the West Bank.

According to the Post, the German tabloid Bild posted a copy of the film on its website in order to combat what it saw as censorship. The paper’s editor explained that he believed that ARD saw the film as “politically unsuitable” because it highlighted “an anti-Semitic worldview in wide parts of society that is disturbing.”

ARD pushed back against the accusations, stating that it believed the film to have exceeded its mandate to focus on anti-Semitism, but the broadcaster eventually relented and “Chosen and Excluded” will air on Wednesday.

Already a subscriber? Several thousand people gathered on the esplanade on Sunday, April 6, in response to the far right's offensive against the judiciary following Marine Le Pen's conviction of embezzlement. While the Socialists, the Communists and several unions and civil society organizations said the rally was premature and instead invited people to demonstrate on April 12, the call from hard-left party La France Insoumise (LFI) and the Greens was nonetheless heeded.

According to LFI, 15,000 people attended, a figure that seemed largely exaggerated. "It was important to show today that when the far right attacks the Republic, democracy and the rule of law, it cannot go unanswered by the people," said Manuel Bompard, LFI's top official, upon arriving with the party's lawmakers.

France braced as far right and leftwing parties plan rallies in wake of Le Pen decision

French prime minister calls for rival gatherings to be held in a spirit of ‘calm, mutual respect and responsibility’

France’s far right is hoping for a massive public show of support tomorrow in a “people’s protest” against [Marine Le Pen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen)
 being barred from standing for president in 2027.

The Rassemblement National (National Rally – RN) party called for a nationwide demonstration under the banner “Save Democracy” after Le Pen was [found guilty](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/marine-le-pen-guilty-national-rally-embezzlement-fake-jobs-scam)
 in a €4m (£3.4m) embezzlement trial.

Leftwing and centrist parties have also called for separate gatherings in and around the capital in support of the law being enforced – as well to back the court, and [judges who have been subject to death threats](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/marine-le-pen-ban-political-and-partisan-says-french-far-right-leader-jordan-bardella)
 requiring police protection.

The prime minister, [François Bayrou](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/from-farmer-to-premier-who-is-francois-bayrou-the-new-french-prime-minister)
, has called for the rival rallies to be held in a spirit of “calm, mutual respect and a spirit of responsibility” to avoid clashes.

The _Ouest-France_ newspaper said the demonstrations would be a “battle of images”. Bayrou was cleared of embezzlement.

Rightwing French MP Éric Ciotti, who supports Le Pen, and has suggested overturning the law barring her and others convicted of fraud from public office, is under investigation on allegations of misuse of public funds.

In 2022, former PM and presidential hopeful [François Fillon and his Welsh wife, Penelope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/french-appeal-court-upholds-conviction-of-francois-fillon-for-embezzlement)
, were convicted on appeal of embezzling public funds in a fake job scandal.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen was found to have been ‘at the heart’ of an organised system of embezzlement. The court found Le Pen to be at “the heart” of this system and guilty of directly organising eight fictitious contracts and instigating a wider fake jobs scheme.

Le Pen and her colleagues are not the only French politicians to have been accused of financial impropriety. The second option raises the prospect of a convicted fraudster entering the Elysée wearing an electronic anklet.

While the RN is hoping for a show of strength this weekend, polls suggest Le Pen may not have the public support she is counting on and claims.

[An institute cluster poll for](https://www.lepoint.fr/politique/sondage-exclusif-61-des-francais-approuvent-la-condamnation-de-marine-le-pen-02-04-2025-2586391_20.php)

_ magazine found 61% of French people thought her conviction justified and two out of three of those quizzed said the immediate application of a bar on standing for public office was “fair”; 43% said the condemnation and punishment was “extremely justified”.

Stewart Chau, director of polling at Vérian Group, said France was engaged in a “battle of opinion” and that the polls had to be viewed with caution.

“If 60% of people believe this justice is impartial and think [Marine Le Pen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen)
 is not above the law and should be judged like anyone else, it still means 40% do not agree and think it is a political decision, which is not an insignificant number,” Chau told the _Observer_.

He said he did not think there would be a massive mobilisation in support of the RN on Sunday.

“The RN is trying to wrap this judgement against it up as a wider issue of an attack on democracy. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

The RN called for a “peaceful popular mobilisation” after Le Pen was found guilty last Monday of embezzling European Parliament funds through a huge fake jobs scam. A 10-year investigation was followed by a nine-week trial last autumn and the three judges delivered their verdict after a three-month deliberation.

Le Pen and eight other RN European Parliament members, who all denied the charges and have appealed, were judged to have been part of an organised “system” of embezzlement between 2004 and 2016 in which European funds supposed to be used to pay EU parliamentary assistants were used to pay the party’s workers in France.

Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, two suspended and two to be served with an electronic tag."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss protests and rallies related to French politics. One article from Le Monde ([https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/04/06/french-left-protests-against-far-right-but-remains-divided_6739901_7.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/04/06/french-left-protests-against-far-right-but-remains-divided_6739901_7.html)) covers a left-wing counter-demonstration in Paris on April 6, 2025, following Marine Le Pen's conviction, with participation from La France Insoumise (LFI) and the Greens (<image:10789>).

Another source, a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally)), details the 2024 French protests against the National Rally, which began on June 9, 2024, in response to the party's victory in the European Parliament election and the subsequent call for legislative elections. The protests involved various political organizations and took place in multiple cities, including a gathering on June 30, 2024, at Place de la République in Paris (<image:10215>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision)) reported on rallies planned by both far-right and left-wing parties in France following Marine Le Pen's conviction for embezzlement (<image:10794>, <image:10793>).


## Elaboration
The image <image:10215>

## Final Judgement
The image in question has been identified in multiple sources as depicting a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, with the swastika painted on a statue. While there were protests in France in 2024 and 2025, the image's context is not related to the French parliamentary elections or Le Pen's victory.

Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family

 earlier this month.

Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned.

In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt.

In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed "handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family".

The Bibas children Kfir and Ariel were the youngest hostages taken to Gaza by Hamas

Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group.

The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack.

Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives.

An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named.

In a statement, the Bibas family said: "In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase.

"We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter.

"Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over.

Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday.

They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. His family say they expect him to be released on Saturday

* * * The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time.

The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day.

They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners.

Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.

Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel. 

But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war. 

Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin "this week".

He said Israel would "not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive.

"If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer," Saar said.

A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals.

Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people.

Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.

Israel, Hamas to begin indirect negotiations on Phase 2 of ceasefire after delays
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thomson Reuters · Posted: Feb 18, 2025 2:46 PM EST | Last Updated: February 18

![A protester holds signs of people held hostage.](https://i.cbc.ca/1.7461957.1739905359!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/israel-palestinians-hostages-families-rally.JPG?im=Resize%3D780)

Israel and Hamas will begin indirect negotiations on a second stage of the Gaza ceasefire deal, officials said on Tuesday, as the Palestinian militant group said it would hand over more hostages, including the bodies of two children, this week.

Khalil al-Hayya, leader of Hamas in Gaza, said the bodies of four hostages, including those of the Bibas family, would be returned on Thursday. Six living hostages would follow on Saturday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed a deal was reached in Cairo to secure the release of six living hostages on Saturday, four deceased hostages on Thursday and four more next week, but stopped short at naming any of them.

An Israeli official said deceased hostages will undergo identification in Israel before they are named.

Negotiations for the second phase of the deal were supposed to start on Feb. 4 — but Qatar, which together with Egypt and the United States is mediating between the sides — said the talks have not officially started yet.

"It will happen this week," Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told a news conference in Jerusalem.

Israel had given mixed signals in the past few weeks about its engagement in the talks over the next stage of the three-phased ceasefire, which came into effect on Jan. 19 with the stated goal of permanently ending the Gaza war.

Mother, 2 children allegedly killed in late 2023
------------------------------------------------

The Bibas family, including Kfir Bibas, who was less than a year old when he was abducted and his brother Ariel, four years old at the time, have been among the highest-profile Israeli hostages seized in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.

Their father Yarden Bibas was released this month but their mother Shiri was not. Hamas said in late 2023 that Shiri and the children [had been killed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hamas-israel-ceasefire-gaza-1.7043170)
 by Israeli bombardments.

Israel has not confirmed their deaths and has only said it has grave concern for their lives. After Hamas's announcement, it appealed to respect the hostage families' privacy.

Hamas frees 3 hostages, Israel releases hundreds of prisoners as fragile ceasefire holds

7 months ago

Hamas militants released three male Israeli hostages on Saturday and Israeli forces began releasing hundreds of prisoners in return after Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped avert a standoff that threatened to sink a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. Read more: https://www.cbc.ca/1.7460415. 

The family said it was "in turmoil" since the announcement by Hamas. "Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over," it said in a statement.

The identity of the fourth deceased hostage has not yet been announced but the families of the six living hostages to be released on Saturday have been informed.

Eliyah Cohen, 27, Tal Shoham, 40, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Omer Wenkert, 23 were all taken hostage on Oct 7. Two others, Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, and Avera Mengistu, 39, crossed over into Gaza independently of each other around a decade ago and have been held since then.

Negotiations over 2nd phase to begin
------------------------------------

The initial phase of the ceasefire deal, which includes a 42-day truce and the return of 33 Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, has remained on track despite a series of setbacks and accusations of violations that had threatened to derail it.

But negotiations over the second stage, aimed at securing the release of the remaining 64 hostages, are expected to be tough, because they include issues like the administration of post-war Gaza, where there are large gaps between the sides.

"We will not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organization in Gaza," Saar said.

But he added that if the negotiations are constructive, Israel will remain engaged and may prolong the ceasefire.

"If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time frame work longer," Saar said.

Remaining hostages believed to be dead
--------------------------------------

So far, 19 Israeli hostages have been returned in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. If the six living hostages and four bodies are returned this week, as announced, four more would remain. Based on information from Hamas, all four are thought to be dead.

The hostages were taken in the Hamas-led cross-border attack in October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's retaliatory assault on Gaza has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, laid waste to much of the enclave, and displaced hundreds of thousands.

An Israeli official said Israel will also start allowing the entry of mobile homes for those Gazans forced to shelter from the winter weather among the ruins left by the 15 months of Israeli bombardments. Construction equipment was allowed in Tuesday in the southern city of Rafah.

Hamas has accused Israel of delaying the delivery and had threatened to postpone the release of hostages until the issue was resolved.

The fragile ceasefire deal has also been overshadowed by U.S. President Donald Trump's call for Palestinians to be moved out and for Gaza to be taken over as a waterfront development under U.S. control.

The plan has been rejected by Palestinian groups, Arab states and Washington's Western allies who say it is tantamount to ethnic cleansing. Israeli leaders have argued that Gazans who want to leave the devastated enclave should be allowed to do so.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Monday he will set up a new unit in his ministry dedicated to facilitating the exit of Gaza residents who want to move to a third country, after reviewing an initial plan for it.

Bodies of the youngest Israeli hostages return home

The bodies of the youngest Israeli hostages, Kfir Bibas and his older brother, Ariel, have been returned to Israel.

Theirs were the faces that broke hearts.

Two small, redheaded Israeli boys, with picture-perfect smiles and hair so fiery that people dressed in orange to remind the world they had not been seen in over a year. A terrified mother clinging to both of her sons while all three were captured by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023.

Sixteen months of anguished family members, community members and world leaders asking, "Where are they?"

Hamas leaders turned over the [bodies on Thursday that were believed to be Shiri Bibas and her two sons](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/19/bibas-family-children-hostage-release-israel-hamas/79196035007/)
, Kfir Bibas and his older brother, Ariel, in saga that has gripped global attention for more than 500 days. The body of a fourth slain hostage, journalist and peace activist Oded Lifshitz, was also released.

“We had hoped and prayed so much for a different outcome.” the Lifshitz family said in a statement.

But the turnover itself marked an abhorrent and cruel spectacle that flew in the face of international law, according to United Nations rights chief Volker Turk. It only added to the grief of families who had endured many long months of agonizing uncertainty.

Early Friday the fate of the Bibas' family took an even bleaker turn.

Israel Defense Forces said it had forensically identified the bodies of two Israeli hostage children – Kfir Bibas and his older brother, Ariel – but that the additional body they received is not that of their mother, Shiri Bibas.

Hamas parades coffins in Gaza
-----------------------------

At a Gaza Strip handover site, Hamas displayed four black coffins on a stage with pictures of hostages before a gathered crowd that included militants dressed in black and camouflage uniforms, according to video of the event. Above the bodies, a large, doctored image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was hung, depicting him as a vampire. 

During the handover, one militant stood beside a poster of a man standing over coffins wrapped in Israeli flags. It read "The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins,” Reuters reported. Red Cross staff held up white screens to try to conceal the coffins from onlookers as they were loaded into their vehicles amid crowds.

"Under international law, any handover of the remains of the deceased must comply with the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensuring respect for the dignity of the deceased and their families,” Turk said in a statement.

Israel awaits for the return of its slain
-----------------------------------------

Once in Israel Thursday, crowds carrying Israeli flags lined streets to pay tribute as a convoy transporting the bodies drove past. In Tel Aviv, people gathered, some weeping, in a public square, opposite Israel's Defense Forces headquarters, at what has come to be known as Hostages Square.

"I think today is one of the saddest days of my 40 years in Israel," said Nicky Cregor, 60, a social worker from Jerusalem. "I feel that we have an endless wound in our hearts that is going to take a long time to heal."

The remains were taken in by Israel’s National Center of Forensic Medicine. Specialists including technicians, anthropologists and radiologists were tasked with using past clinical records to corroborate the identity of Liftshitz and Bibas family. 

Through the use of X-rays, weight data comparisons, DNA databases and dental records they are also charged with answering questions about the circumstances surrounding their deaths.

In the early hours of Friday local time, news broke that while the remains of the two Bibas children and Lifshitz had been identified, the last body returned was not that of Shiri.

“No match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on social media.

“This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organization, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages,” the IDF said. “We demand that Hamas return Shiri home along with all our hostages.”

New questions about Shiri Bibas fate
------------------------------------

Hamas had claimed in November 2023 that the Bibas boys and their mother had been killed in an Israeli airstrike but offered no evidence.

According to the IDF, the forensic examination determined that "based on the intelligence available to us" and the identification process that Ariel and Kfir Bibas "were brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023.”

The last time Shiri Bibas and her sons were seen alive was in a video, circulated widely on social media, showing gunmen abducting the mother, anguish etched on her face, as both children held still, pressed together in her arms.

Kfir was just 9 months old and Ariel was 4 years old when they were kidnapped along with their parents, as Hamas fighters tore through Israel's border towns in the Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and took more than 200 others hostage.

The Bibas boys were the youngest Israeli hostages, and the only children still held in captivity by Hamas after 100 hostages were released in a short-lived ceasefire agreement in November 2023.

Their father, Yarden, 34, who had been kidnapped separately and held in a different part of Gaza, was released on Feb. 1, through a new [ceasefire deal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/01/15/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasfire/77041454007/)
 between Israel and Hamas. 

The first phase of the deal called for Hamas to turn over 33 hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. In turn, Israel was to stop its attacks in Gaza for six months and begin to withdraw its troops from populated areas.

Following Yarden Bibas’ release, the family clung to hope that his wife and sons would soon be set free.

In captivity, they had become symbols of the deadliest assault on Jews since the Holocaust. Photos of the boys were plastered on the sides of buildings around the world. In one, infant Kfir holds a small pink elephant, a big smile stretched across his tiny face. In another, Ariel looks quizzically into the camera, smiling like his brother.

The Bibas children inspired art and songs, prayers and protests as an anxious world waited for news of their fate. Kfir would have turned 2 in January.

Hamas is expected to release six living hostages on Saturday. Questions about Shiri Bibas remain.

CNN  — 

The Israeli military says it has killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group that took part in the October 7, 2023 attacks on southern Israel.

Asaad Abu Sharia, who led the Palestinian Mujahideen Movement and its armed wing the Mujahideen Brigades, was killed in a joint operation with Israel’s Shin Bet security agency, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Saturday.

His death and that of his brother Ahmed Abu Sharia were confirmed by the militant group hours after Gaza’s Civil Defense reported that an Israeli airstrike had hit their family home in the Sabra area of Gaza City.

Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV said the strike killed at least 15 people and injured several. Video showed people searching through the debris of a demolished four-story house.

The Mujahideen Brigades took part in the October 7 attacks alongside Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups and took hostage some of the most high-profile captives, including a family whose suffering became a symbol of the attack.

According to the Israeli military, Sharia was among the militant leaders who stormed Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small Israeli community near the Gaza border where many residents were killed or taken hostage during the brutal assault that led to Israel’s war in Gaza.

Despite not being aware of Hamas’ plans in advance, fighters from the jihadist group joined in the cross-border assault “as an extension of the Hamas attack,” the Israeli military said.

According to Israel, Sharia was directly involved in the abduction and murders of Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas – a mother and two sons who were among the most recognizable victims of the attack, partly because of the young ages of Kfir and Ariel, who were nine months and four years old respectively at the time.

Kfir was the youngest hostage kidnapped into Gaza and the youngest to have been killed. The boys’ mother, Shiri, was 32 at the time of her kidnap. Their father Yarden was also captured, but was released alive in February after 484 days in captivity.

Reacting to news of Sharia’s killing, the Bibas family expressed their “heartfelt gratitude” to the Israeli military, saying his death was “another step on the journey towards closure.”

“While Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir cannot be brought back, we find some measure of comfort knowing these despicable murderers will not harm another family,” the Bibas family said in a statement shared via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.

Israel’s military said Sharia was also involved in the abduction of the Israeli-American couple Gad Haggai and Judi Lynn Weinstein Haggai, and the abduction and killing of Thai national Nattapong Pinta.

The Israeli-American couple were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the attack in 2023. The body of Nattapong, an agricultural worker who was abducted alive on October 7, was recovered from southern [Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/middleeast/israel-arming-hamas-rivals-gaza-intl)
 in a military operation on Friday.

Israel said it believes the Mujahideen Brigades are still holding the body of an additional foreign national. The group has previously denied killing its captives.

The article mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed in an Israeli air strike in November 2023. <image:10796> shows a protester holding signs calling for the release of Shiri Bibas and her children Kfir and Ariel.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:10216>) appears in multiple news articles. CBC News published on February 18, 2025, reported that Hamas said it would return the bodies of four hostages, including the Bibas family, and mentions the Bibas family were among the hostages seized in the October 7, 2023 attack. The USA TODAY article, published on February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Kfir and Ariel Bibas. CNN published an article on June 7, 2025, stating that Israel killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group involved in the October 7, 2023 attacks and mentions the Bibas family.

The articles can be found at: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release-1.7461916](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-release-1.7461916), [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/20/bibas-hamas-youngest-hostages-returned-israel-ceasefire/77741136007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/20/bibas-hamas-youngest-hostages-returned-israel-ceasefire/77741136007/), and [https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl).


## Elaboration
The BBC did publish an article on February 19, 2025, about the Bibas family. The article mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed in an Israeli air strike in November 2023. The image in the claim is a screenshot of a BBC article. Therefore, the claim is likely true.


## Final Judgement
The BBC did publish an article in February 2025 about the Bibas family, and the image in the claim appears to be a screenshot of that article. The article discusses Hamas's claim that the family was killed in an Israeli air strike.

`true`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is supported by evidence. The BBC did publish an article in February 2025, as shown in the image, discussing the Bibas family and Hamas's claims regarding their deaths, as confirmed by a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o) and other news sources.

From [Source](https://www.thejournal.ie/ai-generated-photo-of-bono-and-bob-geldof-with-israeli-flags-is-it-real-6577454-Dec2024/): 
Content: "<image:10853>

AN IMAGE SHARED by Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister, that purports to show Irish rock stars holding Israeli flags is AI-generated.

The image, which is said to show Bono and Bob Geldof staging a “two-man vigil” outside the Israeli Embassy in Dublin, was first posted by a satirical social media account, which has confirmed to _The Journal_ that it was created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and was never meant to be taken seriously.

“In the midst of a genocide, with thousands of maimed orphaned children going to bed without having eaten for days or water to wash their wounds, Bono and Geldof decided to show their solidarity with the rogue Apartheid state responsible,” wrote Yanis Varoufakis on X.

Varoufakis’s 18 December X post includes a screenshot of another post by the account Dr Harold News, which showed an image of Bono and Geldof in a field holding Israeli flags.

! <image:10854>

“BREAKING: Bono and Bob Geldof stage two-man vigil outside Israeli Embassy in Dublin,” that post reads.

Varoufakis’s post has been shared more than 600 times and was viewed on X more than 306,100 times. It was also shared further on other social media platforms, including multiple posts on Facebook that copied Varoufakis’s post word-for-word.

Varoufakis was Greece’s minister for finance for much of 2015, gaining international recognition during the country’s debt crisis.

However, there are signs that the image he shared may not be real.

The picture is set in a field surrounded by verdant hedges, unlike t[he area outside the Israeli embassy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+of+Israel+to+Ireland/@53.3323915,-6.2317407,3a,75y,311.48h,82.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.817675335494144%26panoid%3D5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw%26yaw%3D311.48243025252697!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x48670ec099e519d1:0x8e1e9dcda8ab035e!8m2!3d53.3323109!4d-6.2323792!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F12qh79y9q?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
, which, aside from some leafy residential gardens across the road, is located in a concrete-laden area of Dublin city.

Last week, Israel announced it [is closing that embassy down](https://www.thejournal.ie/israel-closes-embassy-dublin-6572656-Dec2024/?jrnl_lg=1)
, following Ireland’s decision to intervene in a case taken by South Africa against Israel for genocide that is currently before the International Court of Justice.

The clothes worn by the two rock stars in the image are inconsistent, with Bono’s buttons being of various sizes (including one on the bottom of this suit jacket’s lapel), and a ridge appearing on one sleeve of Geldof’s jacket, but not the other.

These are all indications that the image might be AI-generated.

Reverse image searches for the image, or similar images that may have been manipulated, all indicate that the Dr Harold News account was the first to post the picture.

“My page is clearly labelled ‘satire’ and ‘fake news’, so I wasn’t expecting anyone to assume the photo is real,” the person behind the account told _The Journal._

“I can confirm the image was created by Grok AI and the tweet is satire.”

Grok AI is an Artificial Intelligence platform that can create images based on image prompts. <image:10852>\

The Verdict: Fake The image, first shared by a satirical account, is fake and was likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

### **What is the claim?**

An image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag has circulated online, claiming that they are endorsing “apartheid”. In 2023, Bono [condemned](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/culture-stories/1708419663-u2-draft)
 the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and voiced support for peace between the two sides.

### **The verdict**

The viral image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag is a fabrication, most likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

The image gained traction after Irish singer [Mary Coughlan](https://www.instagram.com/coughlan804/?hl=en)
 criticised Bono and Geldof for not speaking out about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. She remarked, “We all saved the world when Bob and Bono were talking about saving the world, and I couldn’t understand what was different about this situation in Gaza."

An X post shows an image of U2 singer Bono and Irish singer Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags, supposedly contradicting their views on apartheid.

> [](https://twitter.com/Resist_05/status/1868896790420111784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

**Verdict: False**

This image was generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

**Fact Check:**

Bono, lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, has been known to get involved in politics throughout his entire musical career. As the co-founder of ONE, his relief efforts were put on a global stage thanks to a partnership with [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2022/10/30/how-apple-and-u2-made-an-unforgettable-blunder-and-whose-fault-it-was/)
, although the public thought of it as intrusive and did not take to that very well.

A post on X shows a picture of Bono along with fellow Irish singer Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags in front of a garden. Check Your Fact ran the image though the AI detection website [TrueMedia](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=BBzITUJkKJNkZYaT30Qz8atnpog.jpg&post=ZUF9Gh0ZZeobrTbsIraImQ==)
, which determined that there was substantial evidence of manipulation.

TrueMedia/Screenshot

A Google [image search](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=ec3d7e0719ee82fc&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1084US1085&q=Bono+holding+israeli+flag&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J6jP6aG80L-e2fp1-X3f05ehOuLXo03yoIKLWy31WZSxqtwwfFO117_gMSEAXUso2ujHDlfa4Fr6kootxTUsY9cea2Byci5ZNorwSCBAEuA9y-1T2SoXin5Nb-pij87Le6a1QB2hpUiN4gJaXOcm-uqcIxTYccItkBUMjCWSqHUbUJ5eXw&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjfmuXk5bSKAxVDkIkEHbuZFtsQtKgLegQIFRAB&biw=1223&bih=705&dpr=2)
 for any authentic pictures of Bono holding the Israeli flag turned up empty, as well.

According to [Lead Stories](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/12/fact-check-fake-image-shows-bono-and-bob-geldof-waving-israeli-flags.html)
, the image was first circulated by an X account that is known for fake news and satire, even saying so in it’s bio. [!CheckYourFact <image:10938>](https://checkyourfact.com/)

### Domestic

U.S. This was spurred by the fact that Crooks had appeared in a BlackRock advertisement in 2022, which had been filmed at his high school.[\[343\]](#cite_note-344)
    [\[344\]](#cite_note-Dunn-2024-345)
     In less than a day, a tweet revealing Crooks's appearance in the advertisement video was viewed more than 17 million times.[\[344\]](#cite_note-Dunn-2024-345)
     The video was then removed by the company.[\[345\]](#cite_note-346)
     The conspiracy theory that some people had foreknowledge is based on the fact that on July 12, 2024, one day before the assassination attempt, the investment company Austin Private Wealth filed a report with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Commission "Securities and Exchange Commission")
     indicating that it had [shorted](/wiki/Shorted "Shorted")
     12 million shares of [Trump Media & Technology Group](/wiki/Trump_Media_%26_Technology_Group "Trump Media & Technology Group")
     (ticker symbol DJT), thus betting that the value of the stock would decrease.[\[346\]](#cite_note-Frank_Chung-2024-347)
     Four days later, the filing was amended to 1,200 shares, and the company apologized for what it asserted was a "filing error".[\[346\]](#cite_note-Frank_Chung-2024-347)
    

In an interview with [Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")
 on April 9, 2025, former Secret Service special agent Richard Staropoli stated that he believed that the assassination attempt, as well as [the one in Florida two months later](/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Florida "Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Florida")

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Friday disclosed an Iranian murder-for-hire plot to kill Donald Trump, charging a man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this week's election with planning the assassination of the Republican president-elect.

Investigators were told of the plan to kill Trump by Farhad Shakeri, an accused Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots.

Shakeri told the FBI that a contact in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard instructed him this past September to set aside other work he was doing and assemble a plan within seven days to surveil and ultimately kill Trump, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.

The official was quoted by Shakeri as saying that “We have already spent a lot of money" and that “money’s not an issue.” Shakeri told investigators the official told him that if he could not put together a plan within the seven-day timeframe, then the plot would be paused until after the election because the official assumed Trump would lose and that it would be easier to kill him then, the complaint said.

Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge.

Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said the president-elect was aware of the assassination plot and nothing will deter him “from returning to the White House and restoring peace around the world.”

According to the complaint, though officials determined that some of the information he provided was false, his statements regarding a plot to kill Trump and Iran's willingness to pay large sums of money were determined to be accurate.

The plot, announced by the Justice Department just days after Trump's defeat of Democrat Kamala Harris, is part of what federal officials have described as ongoing efforts by Iran to target U.S. <image:11241>](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-25020/trump-campaign-hack-iran-election)

Iranian operatives also conducted a hack-and-leak operation of emails belonging to Trump campaign associates in what officials have assessed was an effort to interfere in the presidential election and harm Trump's campaign.

Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump’s reelection, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Two other men were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and kill prominent Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots foiled by law enforcement.

“I’m very shocked,” said Alinejad, speaking by telephone to The Associated Press from Berlin, where she was about to attend a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the tearing down of the wall. as a child but was later deported after spending 14 years in prison for robbery, also told investigators that he was tasked by his Revolutionary Guard contact with plotting the killings of two Jewish-Americans living in New York and Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka."

CNN  — 

The Justice Department on Friday announced federal charges in a thwarted Iranian plot to kill [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 before the presidential election.

According to court documents, Iranian officials asked Farhad Shakeri, 51, in September to focus on surveilling and ultimately assassinating Trump. Shakeri is still at large in Iran, the Justice Department said.

This is a newly disclosed plot and marks [yet another alleged](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/politics/iran-trump-assassination-charges/index.html)
 attempt on Trump’s life by the Iranian regime.

Prosecutors allege Shakeri – who participated in recorded conversations with law enforcement – was originally tasked by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps to carrying out other assassinations against US and Israeli citizens inside the US. “The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran’s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald Trump.”

Iran has “categorically dismissed” the Justice Department’s allegation.

The Foreign Ministry, posting on social media platform X on Saturday, described the claims as “completely baseless and rejected,” adding that “similar accusations have been made in the past,” which Iran has “firmly denied and proven false.” The claims amount to a “malicious conspiracy” aimed at “further complicating the issues between the US and Iran,” the ministry said.

The US government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran may try to retaliate for a 2020 US [drone strike](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/03/asia/soleimani-profile-intl-hnk/index.html)
 that killed [Gen. Iranian-American journalist and political activist Masih Alinejad [confirmed Friday](https://x.com/AlinejadMasih/status/1854959153770643838)
 that she was one of the victims targeted.

Alinejad has been the [target of several assassination plots](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/iranian-revolutionary-guards-assassination-plot/index.html)
, according to the Justice Department.

The two defendants allegedly monitored Alinejad at a speaking event earlier this year, as well as at her home in New York.

In one voice memo between the defendants, Rivera told the others, “This b\*tch is hard to catch, bro. Shakeri also said he was tasked with surveilling and assassinating two individuals described only as Jewish businesspeople living in New York City.

_Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that all three men were specifically charged in the plot against Donald Trump._

Iran launched a barrage of missiles against Israel overnight and into Sunday, with Israeli authorities reporting that more than 80 people were wounded, the vast majority of them lightly.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The United States inserted itself into Israel’s war against Iran, bombing three of the Islamic Republic’s key nuclear sites overnight in an attack it dubbed “Operation Midnight Hammer.” U.S. The war so far has killed hundreds of people and wounded more than 1,000 in Iran and killed two dozen and wounded hundreds in Israel.

Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued it could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon, making it an imminent threat.

The region has been on edge for the past two years as Israel seeks to annihilate the Hamas militant group, an Iranian ally, in the Gaza Strip, where war still rages after Hamas’ Oct. on Wednesday that strikes against Iran would “result in irreparable damage for them.”

The Israeli military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. President Trump meets Israeli PM Netanyahu in Washington <image:11244>

Content: "However, US intelligence sources told CNN the strikes may only have set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back by a matter of months, according to preliminary assessments.

President Trump announced a ceasefire after Iran launched an attack at a US base in Qatar Monday, which it sent warning of in advance.

Israel and Iran traded missile strikes Tuesday, accusing one another of breaking the ceasefire, before each side recommitted to it.

Marc Volovici, a 42-year-old historian, told Reuters in Haifa that the US involvement in the conflict underscored Israel’s dependence on its key ally.

“It’s just a demonstration that Israel, even though it claims to be in charge of its own fate and future, is still dependent on American support completely in terms of both political and financial backing and, of course, ammunition.”

The UN ambassador also hinted that Israel was open to new relationships with Arab nations.

Now is the “time to build bridges and partnerships in the region,” he said, without pointing to any particular country but citing Israel’s normalization of relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco through the Abraham Accords.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked US President Donald Trump for the United States’ involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.

In an address to the nation Tuesday night, the prime minister expressed gratitude to Trump for “his coordination and joining the campaign, not just on the defensive, but also offensively,” calling it a “historic event.”

“We have never had a greater friend in the White House,” he said of Trump.

Netanyahu said that just hours before the ceasefire, Israel carried out the most “devastating” strike Tehran has seen in 50 years.

“We eliminated hundreds of regime operatives and members of the Revolutionary Guard,” he said.

Israel “destroyed” Iran’s nuclear program, Netanyahu said, warning if anyone in Iran tries to restore the program, Israel will “act with the same determination and the same force to foil such an attempt.”

**Remember:** Trump flashed intense anger this morning, criticizing both sides, but reserving his [harshest condemnation for Israel,](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcaf5mst00003b6prm250209)

'They don't know what the f\*\*k they're doing': Trump lashes out at Israel and Iran

02:25

**• Early intel assessment:** The US military’s strikes on three of Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend did not destroy the core components of its nuclear program and likely [only set it back by months](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/intel-assessment-us-strikes-iran-nuclear-sites)
, according to an early US intelligence assessment that was described by sources briefed on it. The White House acknowledged the existence of the assessment but said it disagreed with it.

**• Trump’s rebuke:** US President Donald Trump [flashed intense anger this morning](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcaf5mst00003b6prm250209)
 as the ceasefire he brokered between Israel and Iran appeared to grow more fragile. Before heading to the [NATO summit](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/politics/nato-summit-trump-solitary-approach)
 in the Netherlands, Trump conveyed he was particularly unhappy with Israel.

**• Ceasefire appears to hold:** Both Israel and Iran said they will not break the ceasefire unless the other does so first, after the two countries earlier traded accusations of truce violations. Trump also said he [does not seek regime change in Iran](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-conflict-us-trump-06-24-25-intl-hnk#cmcakn6wq00003b6rnk2xjmfm)
 because he doesn’t want to see “chaos.”

Israelis on the streets of Haifa Tuesday afternoon welcomed a tentative end to their country’s 12-day conflict with Iran and expressed some gratitude to US President Donald Trump for his role in the currently holding ceasefire.

Interviews conducted in the northern city by the Reuters news agency came just hours after Trump used a profanity to lash out at Israel, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, and Iran, of breaching the ceasefire he had announced.

“Yes, that’s typical Trump,” a 70-year-old Haifa resident, who gave her name as Esther, told Reuters.

Haifa has been the target of Iranian missiles since Israel’s initial strikes on June 13, including an attack that injured dozens on Saturday.

Daniel Kopylkov, a 27-year-old cook, told Reuters: “Honestly, I don’t care that much about what Trump said about Israel.

The US struck three Iranian nuclear facilities on Saturday, in attacks the White House said “obliterated” Tehran’s nuclear program. local time, before deleting and reposting after correcting a spelling error in the original post, slamming CNN and The New York Times, for what he called “AN ATTEMPT TO DEMEAN” the strikes.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against CNN’s reporting earlier Tuesday as well, acknowledging its existence but calling it “flat-out wrong.”

Iran’s United Nations envoy Amir-Saeid Iravani thanked Qatar for its role in the Iran-Israel ceasefire at a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday.

“I wish to sincerely thank our brotherly and friendly nation the state of Qatar for its sincere and diplomatic efforts to help end Israeli aggression, establish a ceasefire and prevent a further escalation of regional tensions that threaten peace and stability in the region,” the Iranian diplomat told the council.

Iravani’s expression of gratitude to Qatar comes a day after Iran launched an attack on a US airbase in the Gulf country.

Former President Donald J. Trump’s strong support for Israel has been central to his campaign, highlighting past achievements like relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, and brokering the Abraham Accords, but polls show that reoccupation of the Gaza Strip would be a far less popular policy among Israelis and American supporters of the Jewish state.

In the interview, Hewitt asked Trump if Gaza could be transformed into a prosperous area like Monaco. The remark came during a conversation with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, which marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Trump, the Republican nominee in this year’s US presidential election, claimed in a recent radio interview that he had visited Gaza, a war-torn region he has never officially been recorded visiting. When asked for clarification, a campaign aide asserted that Gaza is “in Israel” and noted that Trump had visited Israel.

The Gaza Strip, under Hamas control since 2007, is not claimed by Israel, though it was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 2005. You know when—I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”

A New York Times report on the candidate’s gaffe said it raised questions about his understanding of the region. Despite some Israeli calls for its annexation, Gaza remains distinct, separated from Israel and the West Bank. Trump responded, “It could be better than Monaco. The campaign’s response, The Times said, suggested an attempt to frame Gaza as part of Israel, aligning with the rhetoric of far-right members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition."

Former President Donald Trump claimed in a radio interview that he has been to Gaza even though no record of such a visit exists.

The comment, which Trump made in an interview with conservative radio host [Hugh Hewitt](https://hughhewitt.com/former-president-trump-on-the-anniversary-of-the-10-7-massacre-in-israel)
 that was broadcast on Monday, came in response to a question about whether the occupied territory, which Israel has largely razed to the ground over the last year, could be developed to “be Monaco, if it was rebuilt the right way?”

“It could be better than Monaco. President Trump has been to Israel.”

Gaza is not, nor has it ever been “in Israel.” The Palestinian territory has been [illegally occupied by Israel](/news/2023/11/8/qa-former-un-expert-stresses-israels-occupation-of-gaza-never-ended)
, as well as the West Bank and East Jerusalem, since 1967.

Israel withdrew its army and settlers from Gaza in 2005, under a policy that the Israeli government at the time dubbed “disengagement.” But Israel remains an occupying power in Gaza under international law, as its military continues to retain effective control of its borders, airspace and coastline.

The Israeli military has invaded the territory again for the last year following the October 7 attacks by Hamas.

Although false claims are not uncommon from Trump, it was unclear if these were deliberate lies or whether they just revealed his lack of knowledge about the region’s geography.

[Trump visited Israel](/news/2017/5/23/donald-trump-ends-middle-east-tour)
 and the occupied West Bank in 2017, his first year in office, and met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the time. It’s a rough place, before the, you know, before all of the attacks and before the back and forth what’s happened over the last couple of years.”

Asked to clarify, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign told the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-gaza-israel.html)
 that “Gaza is in Israel. Kushner had called Gaza’s waterfront property “very valuable.”

In the interview with Hewitt, Trump also referenced Gaza’s oceanfront location.

“They never took advantage of it,” he said. The West Bank and Gaza are separate occupied territories, only reachable to each other by travelling through Israel — something most Palestinians are not allowed to do.

Trump’s comments about Gaza echoed those made by his son-in-law and former adviser [Jared Kushner](/program/newsfeed/2024/3/20/former-trump-official-calls-gazas-waterfront-property-very)
 earlier this year. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,” Trump responded."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, "I've been there," referring to Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that there is no record of Trump visiting Gaza.

Therefore, while the claim about the statement is accurate, the statement itself is factually incorrect.

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Israel has completely destroyed more than 1,000 buildings in the Zeitoun and Sabra neighbourhoods of [Gaza City](/news/liveblog/2025/8/24/live-israel-pounds-gaza-protesters-across-globe-denounce-gaza-city-famine)
 since it started its invasion of the city on August 6, trapping hundreds under the rubble, the Palestinian Civil Defence says.

The agency said in a statement on Sunday that ongoing shelling and blocked access routes are preventing many rescue and aid operations in the area.

Emergency workers continue to receive numerous reports of missing people but are unable to respond, while hospitals are overwhelmed by the toll of the attacks, it added.

“There are grave concerns about the continued incursion of Israeli forces into Gaza City, at a time when field crews lack the capacity to deal with the intensity of the ongoing Israeli attacks,” the Civil Defence said.

“There is no safe area in [the Gaza Strip](/news/2025/8/23/israeli-attacks-kill-37-in-gaza-as-more-palestinians-die-from-starvation)
, whether in the north or south, where shelling continues to target civilians in their homes, shelters, and even in their displacement camps.”

Israeli tanks have been rolling into the Sabra neighbourhood as Israel moves to fully occupy Gaza City, forcing close to 1 million Palestinians there southwards.

The Civil Defence’s assertion appears to confirm fears that Israel is planning to fully demolish Gaza City, as it did in Rafah, a campaign that rights advocates say could be aimed at removing all Palestinians from Gaza.

At least three people, including a child, were among the latest victims killed in an attack on a residential apartment on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City, according to a source in the enclave’s emergency and ambulance department.

The area, where famine has been declared, has been under relentless Israeli bombardment over the last several weeks. Residents reported explosions echoing nonstop through the neighbourhoods, while several buildings were also blown up further north, in the ravaged Jabalia refugee camp.

At least 51 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza on Sunday, including 27 in Gaza City and 24 aid seekers, medical sources told Al Jazeera.

Gaza’s Ministry of Health said eight more people died of [Israeli-induced hunger](/news/2025/8/24/amid-gaza-famine-palestinian-girl-struggles-to-survive)
 as starvation in the enclave intensifies, raising deaths from malnutrition to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war began.

Israeli forces have been routinely opening fire on hungry Palestinians as they attempt to secure meagre aid parcels at the controversial, Israeli and US-backed GHF sites.

‘Impossible’ to stay alive
--------------------------

Commenting on the worsening humanitarian situation, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said that famine is the “last calamity” hitting Gaza, where people are experiencing “hell in all shapes”.

“‘Never Again’ has deliberately become ‘again’. Denial is the most obscene expression of dehumanisation,” Lazzarini wrote on X.

He added that it was time for the Israeli government to allow aid organisations to provide assistance, and for foreign journalists to be allowed into the enclave.

Gaza’s Ministry of Interior warned against Israeli plans to forcibly displace residents from Gaza City and the northern governorates, urging people against leaving their homes despite heavy bombardment.

The ministry called on residents to remain in their communities, or if threatened, to move only to nearby areas rather than relocate to the south.

“We urge citizens and displaced persons residing in Gaza City not to respond to the occupation’s threats and terrorism, and to refuse to be displaced and move to the remaining areas of the central and Khan Younis governorates,” it said.

“There is no safe place in any of the governorates of the Gaza Strip, and the occupation commits the most heinous crimes daily, even bombing the tents of displaced persons in areas it falsely claims are humanitarian or safe.”

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Palestinians are nonetheless fleeing areas in Gaza City “under intensive Israeli air strikes and also attacks by quadcopters”.

“We met a couple of these families, and they said that it was \[nearly\] impossible for them to stay alive as they were fleeing and quadcopters were opening fire on whatever was moving in that area,” Khoudary said.

“Some Palestinians made it safely and were able to flee, but others were trapped in those areas and are unable to leave,” she added.

A mounting humanitarian crisis
------------------------------

The UN estimates that approximately 92 per cent of all residential buildings in Gaza – around 436,000 homes – have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The resulting debris amounts to nearly 50 million tonnes – an overwhelming quantity of rubble that would take decades to remove under current conditions.

Humanitarian organizations warn that the delay in debris removal and body recovery is not only deepening psychological trauma across Gaza but also threatens to become a public health and environmental catastrophe.

Gaza: Destruction of vital lifting gear halts search for thousands buried under rubble
======================================================================================

22 April 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Families in Gaza were holding on to the slim chance of finding loved ones buried under the ruins of destroyed homes – but that hope is fading fast.

The destruction of key heavy machinery on Tuesday following reported Israeli airstrikes has brought rescue and recovery efforts to a standstill, making it even harder to reach the estimated 11,000 bodies still trapped under the debris.

According to local authorities, the strikes put a halt to all solid waste and debris removal operations, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at a briefing in New York.

Until recently, bulldozers and other excavation equipment had been used in painstaking efforts to recover bodies from the wreckage.

One bulldozer operated by Atif Nasr – who before the war worked building and repairing roads – had become vital in the grim task of extracting the remains of loved ones from the rubble.

He was interviewed by a _UN News_ correspondent in Gaza before the strike but now his grim but vital work has come to a standstill after his vehicle was destroyed.

![Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.](https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production%20Library/22-04-2025-UN-News-Gaza.bmp/image3000x3000.jpg "Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.")

UN News

Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.

Months trapped in rubble
------------------------

The Dahdouh family managed to recover the remains of their son, Omar, from the ruins of their home, almost a year after he was killed in an airstrike which levelled their seven-story building.

Standing at the site, Omar’s brother, Moayad, shared the family’s ordeal.

“His body remained trapped under the rubble for nearly a year. After the war, we tried to retrieve him, but with the building so large and with no heavy machinery available, it was impossible.

“We searched everywhere for a bulldozer to reach the ground floor – where Omar had been – but during the war, Israeli forces destroyed or burned all the bulldozers or excavators that could have helped us.”

A decent burial
---------------

In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, the Dajani family continues to live in what’s left of their destroyed home, where the bodies of three of their children remain buried.

Their father Ali remembers the time they died with a heavy heart.

“We fled to the beach area during the bombings."

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant as Pennsylvania Gov. 22, 2024 (Commonwealth Media Services photo)

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to Pennsylvania on Sunday to visit a military facility in Lackawanna County that builds some of the equipment [used in the weaponry](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)

Gov. Matt Cartwright (D-8th District) and other local officials were on hand for Zelenskyy’s tour of the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), which builds 155-millimeter howitzer rounds for the U.S. “Pennsylvania looks forward to building a close relationship with Zaporizhzhia as we continue to stand on the side of freedom.”

Zelenskyy is scheduled to speak at the U.N. He plans to present a “victory plan” which includes a request to use long-range missiles on targets in Russia when he meets with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in Washington, D.C., While in the U.S., [Zelenskyy may also meet with former President Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/biden-letting-ukraine-strike-deep-within-russia-key-to-ending-war-zelenskyy-says)

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

Republican anger clouds Zelensky-Biden 'victory plan' meeting

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war): 
Content: "We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

! “We are taking the necessary measures and have delivered the required messages.” He added that the Syrian Democratic Force’s (SDF) understanding with Damascus requires a “joint establishment of a new Syria,” while emphasizing that Turkey maintains ties with other Kurdish groups open to cooperation.

Fidan also addressed comments by Turkish President Recep Erdogan, saying Ankara would not hesitate to act if threatened. <image:11662>

US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan within an informal meeting of The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) foreign ministers in Antalya, on May 15, 2025. Speaking to TGRT television, he criticized Israel’s involvement in Syria and voiced opposition to attempts at ethnic division under the guise of “preserving national identity.”

“Syria is next to us, and any unrest there directly affects us,” Fidan said. Abdulkadir Selvi, a journalist close to the government, wrote in Hürriyet that US Special Representative for Syria Tom Barrack has adopted “a softer tone.” Barrack, who once insisted on “one nation, one people, one army, and one Syria,” has reportedly floated the idea of a “looser arrangement.”

“This stance by the US ambassador has caused concern in Ankara,” Selvi wrote, suggesting the shift may signal changes in Washington’s Syria policy.

**Regional Tensions Over Minority Demands**

Selvi also reported that Israel has pressed the US administration to secure privileges for Druze communities [under its influence in Syria](https://levant24.com/tag/hijri/)
. He claimed the SDF and affiliated groups are using those demands as leverage to seek similar concessions.

Amid these competing pressures, Abdi has resisted full integration into the Syrian army despite the March 10 agreement and calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. (AFP)

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said developments in Syria remain a critical concern for Ankara, warning that any unrest directly impacts Turkey. Joe Wilson, centered on integrating the forces into the Syrian state through a decentralized model.

A source from the autonomous administration (AANES) told ANHA that negotiations with Damascus face obstacles but remain ongoing."

As such, what happens in Syria greatly matters to international stakeholders like the US, but also regional stakeholders like Israel and Türkiye.

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

# Search Result
From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: "“With some international and local powers now adopting federal or decentralized models, Israel believes the time is right to apply military pressure to consolidate this model, particularly in the south, as a first step toward sharing influence and ensuring secure borders to strengthen influence in the northeast with the Syrian Defense Forces.”

Aware of the [fragility](https://snhr.org/blog/2025/03/11/803-individuals-extrajudicially-killed-between-march-6-10-2025/)
 that Sharaa’s government faces from the multiplicity of actors vying for control, however, Turkey has worked to strengthen the central government by using its own political card with Kurdish political factions to try to bring a close to any fragmentation of the Syrian state, even if it sees Erdogan drop a long held ideological mainstay.

Underlining Ankara’s seriousness, the first foreign visit to Syria after the fall of Assad came from Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in December. “I believe that it is still a little early to talk about the dissolution of the forces in Syria because we have one demand, which is the establishment of a decentralized authority for the Kurds in northern Syria,” the SDF military commander says. 

Nearly three months after the agreement was signed, Turkey’s [patience](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/290520251)
 was wearing thin.

In a meeting between Sharaa and Erdogan on May 24, the two sides discussed the formulation of a common vision to end “the ongoing threat” posed by the Kurdish forces to Syria’s territorial integrity and Turkey’s national security, through direct field and security coordination, says the source close to the Turkish president.

\*\*\*

Speaking after a round of technical talks in Baku in April between the Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan tried to downplay what was on everyone’s mind.

August 28, 2025

With a shake of a hand in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in mid May, Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa completed his political transformation.

Gone was the man who once had an American [bounty](https://x.com/DigitalOutreach/status/862320076241993730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E862320076241993730%7Ctwgr%5E7104739bc23ce28a874a34d36e623f1bbb993594%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmonitor.com%2F20170511-dead-or-alive-us-offers-10-million-for-syria-rebel-commander%2F)
 of US$10 million on his head. A host of other investors are practically [salivating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/too-good-be-true-investors-eye-syria-after-trump-sanctions-move-2025-05-14/)
 to bring money back into the country.

Sharaa enjoyed a lavish Gulf tour, “living his best life,” as some commentators [noted](https://x.com/ragipsoylu/status/1929128687913390571?s=46&t=jkJlaUvTKeCtY4AcNtnlqQ)
.

In the high of the moment, and after repeated encounters with the Americans and mixed signals from the Israelis, Sharaa misread the messages and thought he was greenlit to take control of all of Suwayda, the city tucked away in the country’s south with a population predominantly made up of Druze, according to multiple sources.

And thus in just a few weeks’ time, Sharaa’s high of highs came crashing back to the earth.

On July 11, [clashes](https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7/769601/)
 broke out between Bedouin tribesmen and Druze figures on the Damascus-Suwayda road. Government troops have been shown to have been [implicated](https://x.com/suwayda24/status/1954520917066821658)
 in extrajudicial killings, often [filming](https://www.reuters.com/world/how-syrian-attackers-killed-one-hand-gun-another-camera-2025-07-29/)
 the attacks as threatening messages to those who don’t fall in line.

Map of Israel’s projected influence in the south of Syria

In addition to bombing more than 500 sites across Syria, including the [capital](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2025/05/israel-used-12-aircraft-in-its-raids-on-syria/)
 of Damascus and the [port](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx808q7lrno)
 of Latakia, Israel also began to expand its ground invasion into the Daraa countryside, to create a new 15 kilometer security zone. As the pace of the Israeli attacks continued unabated after the ouster of Assad, several diplomatic pathways emerged, the most public of which have been the [talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-israel-have-begun-talks-avoid-clashes-syria-turkish-sources-say-2025-04-10/)
 between Turkey and Israel in the Azerbaijani capital Baku aimed at creating a “technical mechanism” to reduce “unwanted incidents” in Syria.

According to a former Syrian diplomat, the Israeli attacks in the south of Syria are in part driven by a concern about Turkey’s potential influence near Israeli-held territory.

“After Iran’s withdrawal from Syria, Turkey is looking to fill the vacuum by striking understandings with the new leadership in Damascus,” the diplomat says. This would ⁠prevent any Turkish military or factional presence near the Golan Heights and bide time until Israel can⁠ find a reliable local partner in the future as an unofficial line of defense, the diplomat says.

This concern was echoed in Israel. 

Writing for an Israeli think tank focused on “Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Syria,” authors Tal Beeri and Boaz Shapira spell out the concern in blunt terms in a March article: “A scenario in which Turkish Air Force jets operate in Syrian airspace against Israeli Air Force jets is a possible one.” And in equal measure, they proffered a threat: “Israel must set the rules of the game in the region."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

# Your Analysis

The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that Turkey, under President Erdogan, was critical of Israel's involvement in Syria and made strong statements against Israel's actions. However, the evidence does not confirm that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Erdogan's stance against Israel and meetings with Syrian officials, there is no direct evidence of a request to the U.S.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's involvement in Syria and its relationship with Israel.  An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

Within these zones, Ankara has inserted substitutive governance networks, dispersing gendarmeries, judge panels and municipal advisory bodies that are underpinned by Turkish parliamentary appropriations. Accordingly, the reconfiguration of Syria’s political order will hinge as much upon these domestic actors as upon any external endeavor to impose change.

**Legacy actors recalibrate** 

Even as Turkey and Israel now dominate the foreign policy landscape in Syria, the influence of Russia and Iran—once the key players of the Assad regime—has not entirely disappeared from the equation. Turkey and Israel, for instance, impose authority over selected territories without openly claiming them; the resulting spheres of governance more closely resemble imperial protectorates than classical foreign military occupations, thereby reconstituting the region’s constitutional and geopolitical boundaries without invoking outright annexation.

**Conclusion: Controlled disintegration as doctrine**

If the Syrian model is reproduced, the region may enter an era in which weaker states function as laboratories for informal empire and diplomacy is replaced by strategic classification. As this would also be in Israel’s interests, Israel would help in any way practical, not merely militarily.

Your email address will not be published. In this chaotic vacuum, Turkey and Israel have re-engaged, translating Syria’s power void into a contest of occupied sovereign space, masked by counterterrorism and humanitarian rhetoric.

**Competing foreign agendas**

In the shifting strategic landscape of post-Assad Syria, both countries have consolidated their positions in what many now refer to as Syria’s “second civil war”—a reconfiguration of violence in which domestic forces have become subordinate to competitive regional designs. Despite diverging styles and strategic end goals, Turkey and Israel have emerged as the leading external powers, influencing both territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria’s new order.

Ankara’s engagement is both pervasive and systematic. Concurrently, the circulation of the Turkish lira and the promulgation of Turkish-language curricula illustrate an integration that transcends influence, resembling statecraft more than temporary occupation.

By contrast, Israel pursues a policy of indirect intervention aimed principally at threat containment, rather than seizing territory."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

The search results discuss Turkey's involvement in Syria and its relationship with Israel.  An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025 and had strained relations with Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results highlight Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's involvement in Syria and its relationship with Israel.  An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results reveal that in March 2025, Turkey directly intervened in Syria ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)), with the Armenian Weekly publishing an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the "second civil war" in Syria and the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel (<image:11663>). PBS News reported on July 23, 2025, that Syria requested defense support from Turkey following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) (<image:11724>). However, neither source mentions any direct communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025 and had strained relations with Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results highlight Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

October 2, 2024

Millions of Israelis scrambled for cover amid air raid sirens as Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles into the Zionist state on October 1, the latest escalation in a growing conflict that is threatening to drag the entire region into a [broader war](https://trt.global/world/article/18214961)
.

The attack proved yet again that Israel’s much-vaunted air defence system—[said](https://nation.time.com/2012/11/19/iron-dome-a-missile-shield-that-works/)
 to be the “most effective, most-tested missile shield the world has ever seen”—is far from impenetrable.

As the missile defence system came under the spotlight, security experts rushed to analyse its weak spots and how it was overwhelmed by the missile barrage.

“Iran’s strategy of launching missile barrages is designed to saturate air defence systems and force the Israelis to make tough choices about which to engage and which to let pass under significant time constraints,” Samuel Hickey of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation tells _TRT World_.

Israel [said](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/iran-missile-attack-israel/index.html)
 it intercepted a “majority” of the ballistic missiles, which means the interception rate was less than 100 percent. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli forces, [said](https://x.com/JoeTruzman/status/1841203657712550215)
 Iranian missiles hit central and southern Israel.

However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) [insisted](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-claims-90-of-its-missiles-hit-their-targets-in-israel/)
 that 90 percent of its missiles hit the intended targets.

It was the [largest ballistic missile strike](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966)
 on any country in history.

“We still don’t know if the missiles that appeared to breach Israel’s air defence systems had their payloads intact or reached their intended targets,” Hickey says, noting that Iran seemingly launched some of its more advanced missiles in the October 1 attack.

Tehran intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by [oversaturating](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)
 Israeli air defence, particularly in central Israel.

That’s because the number of ballistic missiles fired was about 180, notably higher than the approximately 120 similar projectiles it hurled at Israel in an earlier attack on [April 15](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-hezbollah-conflict/card/how-big-is-iran-s-missile-arsenal--earTfWyIeIJgWnm5UHor)
.

**How Israeli air defence system works**

Israel has a three-tier air defence system. Iran's missile programme has consistently been a significant focus of Israeli intelligence, and Israeli officials have likely accounted for the limitations of their defence systems in such scenarios,” he says.

It is the third time Israel’s air defence systems have become overwhelmed by a massive number of missiles entering its airspace at once.

First, an intense rocket barrage from [Hamas in the surprise attack](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-08/israeli-intelligence-caught-by-surprise-hamas-attack/102949034)
 on October 8 last year [saturated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-10/what-is-israel-iron-dome-air-defence-gaza-rockets/102952172)
 Israel’s air defence system. Then Iran launched a missile attack against Israel on April 15, leaving Israeli air defence systems [overwhelmed](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-16/how-israel-air-defence-stopped-iran-drone-missile-attacks/103707770)
.

“Even with a strong intercept record, the offence-defence race dramatically favours the offence,” he says.

According to a [report](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)
 by the Institute for the Study of War, a higher number of missiles fired by Iran in the latest attack targeted a “very small geographic area in densely populated” parts of central Israel.

It means all missiles hurtling towards the densely populated area presumably needed interception.

“The increase \[in the number of\] in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defence system by saturating it,” it said.

Hickey says each attack, especially one that partially breaches defences, provides data for improving interception algorithms, tactics and technology.

“Israel is likely to analyse any weaknesses or failures in its missile defence response and adapt accordingly… States must only overwhelm defences by saturating key target areas with incoming missiles.”

!How Iran breached Israel’s air defence by overwhelming it with missiles <image:11762>

[WORLD](/world/world)

6 MIN READ

How Iran breached Israel’s air defence by overwhelming it with missilesIran’s strategy of sending hundreds of missiles into Israel at once is ‘designed to saturate’ its air defence systems.

Share

Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel. The first or bottom tier is the most talked about Iron Dome, which intercepts short-range, surface-to-surface rockets of up to 70-kilometre range.

David’s Sling is the middle tier that intercepts medium-range missiles of up to 300 kilometres.

The third tier consists of Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 defence systems meant to intercept medium- and long-range missiles of up to 2,000 kilometres.

A number of mobile “batteries” of air defence systems deployed around big cities help Israel detect any projectile before it enters its air space.

Based on the trajectory of an incoming rocket, the system quickly estimates the precise impact location. If the anticipated site of the impact is far from populated areas or military installations, the system lets the rocket land without interception.

Otherwise, the air defence system quickly fires an “interceptor missile” aimed at pulverising the moving rocket before it can land inside Israel.

Tel Aviv likely anticipated the possibility of some missiles breaching its defence systems, Hickey says.

“Israeli defence planners are aware that no system can guarantee 100 percent interception."

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.

 [Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/associated-press) The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas.

It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

TRT World reported that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)). The evidence does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome during the attack.

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. The strike appears to have been more sophisticated than one earlier this year.**

Elizabeth Dent is the Nathan and Esther K. The Iraqi militia [Kataib Hezbollah](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/profile-kataib-hezbollah)
 added that any strike on Iranian oil targets will spur attacks on Gulf oil targets. Moreover, Gulf littoral cities are much closer to Iran than Israeli cities, so leaders fear they could be effectively targeted by larger swarms of short-range missiles and drones in addition to MRBMs.

Since last week’s attack—most notably on October 9, when Saudi crown prince Muhammad bin Salman [met with](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-crown-prince-meets-iran-foreign-minister-riyadh-saudi-agency-says-2024-10-09/)
 Iran’s foreign minister in Riyadh—Gulf officials have signaled that they view their previous [Chinese-brokered detente](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/closing-washingtons-china-gap-middle-east-partners)
 with Tehran as the best defense against Iran’s arsenal. Yet some of Iran’s munitions were able to penetrate, and America’s vulnerable regional partners may not view the widespread imagery of Iranian missile impacts in the same terms as Washington. 

**A New Test for Missile Defense Cooperation**
----------------------------------------------

According to a [Pentagon release](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3923123/us-assets-in-mediterranean-again-helped-defend-israel-against-iranian-missiles/)
 immediately after the October 1 attack, the strike was “nearly twice the scope” of Iran’s [April 13 attack](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/series/risks-and-opportunities-post-april-13-middle-east)
 on Israel—an assessment that seemingly referred to the number of MRBMs used and the number of sites hit. foreign and defense policy toward the Gulf states, Iraq, and Syria.

Brief Analysis

In discussing missile defense cooperation with risk-averse Gulf partners, Washington needs to realistically address the specifics of Iran’s latest attack on Israel, including the degree to which defenses were penetrated.

On October 1, Iran fired a wave of around 200 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) at Israel, targeting air bases, radar facilities, and security elements that Tehran deems responsible for the recent killings of Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The release concluded that “while most of the missiles were destroyed before reaching their target, some did impact and cause minimal damage.”

The April 13 attack used more overall munitions than October 1 (320, including drones), but all 200 missiles used on October 1 were MRBMs compared to around 120 MRBMs in April. Iran also appeared to target four or five sites this time, versus a reported three in April.

Furthermore, the latest attack included only Iranian launches, while April 13 included a smattering of drone, Katyusha, and cruise missile launches by Iranian partners in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. U.S., British, and French assets intercepted a significant proportion of the April 13 munitions, [aided](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hezbollah-naim-qassem-exclusive-interview-war-escalation-rcna148332)
 by Jordan and likely other Arab partners. Vivid imagery of Iranian missiles hitting Israeli territory may have more psychological impact there than Washington realizes, and “minimal damage” may be unacceptable. 

In general, Gulf leaders believe that layered air defenses and IAMD are critical to intercepting potential future attacks—a view shaped by the drone and cruise missile strikes that hit Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais refineries in September 2019, and by the drones and missiles that the Yemeni Houthis and Iran-backed Iraqi militias launched against Abu Dhabi in January-February 2022. Yet the imagery of missiles penetrating these defenses on October 1 could give them doubts about intercepting a high proportion of Iranian projectiles during a potential future conflict in the Gulf, even with ample investment and partnerships via the United States and Israel. 

Statements by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) play into this fear, threatening that any U.S. officials should not try to sugarcoat the reality that several Iranian missiles did penetrate Israel’s defenses on October 1. Absent an Israeli government statement on the attack’s precise impact, open-source estimates indicate that 181 of the fired missiles launched successfully, and around three-quarters of these were intercepted en route—primarily by Israeli air defenses, with help from the U.S."

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months."

The evidence provides conflicting information regarding the interception rate.

The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests a lower interception rate, with the Washington Institute reporting around three-quarters.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)) <image:11762> PBS News reported that Iran fired over 180 missiles and that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90%.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the Iron Dome's interception rate during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack. While PBS News states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)), the Wikipedia article indicates that Israel reported shooting down "most" of the missiles, and the Israeli military disputed Iran's claim of 90% of its missiles hitting their targets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)).

TRT World reported that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)). The evidence does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported that the Iranian missile strike on October 1, 2024, appeared to have hit some targets, and that the Iron Dome is used to intercept incoming missiles ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets)). The Washington Institute states that around three-quarters of the missiles were intercepted ([https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf)). Al Jazeera reports that the US and Israel worked together to shoot down most of the projectiles, and the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, while the IRGC claimed 90 percent of the projectiles hit their targets ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). <image:i> <image:11981> <image:11967> <image:11980>


## Elaboration
The evidence provides conflicting information regarding the interception rate. The Washington Institute states that around three-quarters of the missiles were intercepted ([https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf)).

The claim that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests a lower interception rate, with the Washington Institute reporting around three-quarters.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

He is a young man of 19 in a blue t-shirt, standing in the foreground, with six relatives aged from childhood to middle age smiling behind him. Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:11999>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

Israeli attack on tent camp outside hospital in Gaza kills at least 4, injures dozens

A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage Monday in Gaza and Lebanon as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places. Israel suffered its own losses as troops came under fire from Hezbollah. But much of the focus fell on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital. Leila Molana-Allen reports. A warning, images and accounts in this story are disturbing.

GEOFF BENNETT: Welcome to the "News Hour."

A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens.

Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.

AMNA NAWAZ: That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.

That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.

And a warning: Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V.

that was supposed to heal became shackles.

Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.

AOUNI KHATTAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out.

A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him.

He turned to ashes.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: At least four people were killed and dozens injured.

Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments.

Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.

UHM MAHMOUD WADHI, Displaced Gazan (through translator): Everything has burned, everything.

As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters.

Where shall I go?

My tent has collapsed, destroyed.

All our clothes and belongings are gone.

Who should we speak to?

Where is the safety?

We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us.

We are exhausted.

We have had enough.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter.

The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.

FATIMA AL AJAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): (through translator): They were sleeping unarmed.

They're innocent.

This is little Rahad's blanket here.

She was only 2 years old.

This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere.

Then there was another wave of airstrikes.

The injured and dead were everywhere.

We have had enough of this.

Have mercy on us.

They took their childhoods away.

They took our smiles away.

They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war.

He doesn't fear death anymore.

He's seen too much.

ABDULLAH AL AJAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital.

The children here are dying.

Everyone is going to die.

We're not going to keep going from place to place.

At least we will die in our country.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone.

The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.

Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.

REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through translator): We are required to provide better protection.

We will investigate this incident, learn and improve.

Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.

After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli Prime Minister (through translator): It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas.

The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists.

Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.

The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages.

Fully a third of the country is now under fire.

Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.

The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country.

In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.

Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other.

The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south.

His family survived, but many in their building didn't.

MOHAMMAD SALAMOUN, Beirut Resident (through translator): We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything.

I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this.

When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Some have decided they can't take it anymore.

Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.

After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.

WIDAD LAKHAL, Displaced From Lebanon (through translator): My heart is in Lebanon.

We will definitely return to Lebanon.

I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear.

One can't trust Israel.

It targets all the places.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling.

It is burning.

For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

An Israeli airstrike on the al-Aqsa Hospital compound in central Gaza sent flames ripping through tents housing displaced people early on Oct. 14. (Video: Reuters)

Israel’s military struck what it said was a Hamas command center [embedded inside a hospital compound in the Deir al-Balah](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/14/israel-airstrike-gaza-hospital-tent-camp-fire/)
 region of central Gaza early Monday. At least four people were killed in the attack within the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital grounds and 40 injured, including women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said. A widely shared video of the fierce blaze appeared to show at least one person on a bed burning alive while onlookers shouted. Separately, Israel’s military said it struck 200 targets linked to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)
, killed last Friday in an airstrike in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/01/nx-s1-5059999/hamas-militant-leader-announced-dead-by-israel-military)
, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:12085>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Content: "CTP-ISW cannot independently verify the locations of Israeli strikes._

**Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1**.\[72\] This is the second time that Hezbollah targeted Mossad Headquarters near Tel Aviv in the recent days.\[73\] Hezbollah also reported that it fired a Fadi-4 rocket targeting Unit 8200 headquarters near Tel Aviv for the first time on October 1.\[74\] Unit 8200 is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for signals intelligence and similar activities.\[75\] Hezbollah separately claimed that it fired medium-range rockets targeting Sde Dov Airport, which closed in 2019, near Tel Aviv on October 1.\[76\] Hezbollah said that these attacks are part of “Operation Khaybar,” which is Hezbollah’s response to the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah on September 27.\[77\] The IDF has not commented on either attack at this time.

**Hezbollah continued its attack campaign targeting Israeli civilian and military sites in Israel on October 1.**  Hezbollah conducted a two-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF position in Metula.\[78\] The IDF said that it detected several projectiles over Metula and intercepted some of them.\[79\] Hezbollah also mortared Israeli forces in Avivim on October 1.\[80\] The IDF said that it also identified individual projectiles that fell in open areas in Avivim.\[81\] Hezbollah claimed on October 1 that the latest attack campaign against Israel is in response to Israel’s ”invasion” of Lebanese towns and villages.\[82\]

!

**Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.\[83\]** The US ambassador to Iraq announced that an attack took place at the Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a US State Department facility.\[84\] The attack occurred hours before the Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting Israel. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah may not engage Israeli forces while Israeli forces are only staging “sporadic raids” that do not remain in Lebanon.
*   **Hezbollah Attacks Targeting Northern Israel:** Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1.
*   **Iraq:** Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.
*   **Houthis:** Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.
*   **Terrorist Attack in Israel:** Two unidentified individuals shot and killed eight civilians in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, on October 1.

!

**Gaza Strip**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Erode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to sustain clearing operations in the Gaza Strip
*   Reestablish Hamas as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip

**The IDF Air Force struck a Hamas command-and-control site in the northern Gaza Strip on October 1.\[97\]** The IDF reported that Hamas had been using a former United Nations Relief and Works Agency school east of Gaza City as a site to plan and execute attacks targeting Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip and into Israeli territory.\[98\] The IDF added that it took steps to minimize casualties in the airstrike.\[99\]

**Palestinian militias conducted three attacks targeting Israeli forces and armor near the Netzarim Corridor on October 1.\[100\]**

!

!

**West Bank**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Establish the West Bank as a viable front against Israel

**The IDF reported on October 1 that Israeli security forces conducted an operation in the Balata refugee camp, Nablus, and killed two Palestinian fighters.\[101\]** The IDF identified one of the two fighters killed in Balata refugee camp as a member of the al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.\[102\] The IDF said that this individual was responsible for conducting shooting attacks targeting IDF positions in the West Bank and recruiting fighters from Nablus.\[103\] The IDF also recovered several firearms and IEDs and detained two wanted persons during the operation. UKMTO reported sustained damage to _Minoan Courage_.\[116\]

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. <image:12093>

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. Israeli Army Radio reported that over 3,000 of Hezbollah’s Radwan special operations forces deployed along the Israel-Lebanon border following the October 7 attacks to conduct a long-planned ground infiltration into northern Israel.\[56\] Hezbollah pioneered the idea of ground attacks into Israel, and it developed the Radwan Force to this end.\[57\]

!

**The IDF Air Force continued its air campaign to degrade Hezbollah's leadership and capabilities on October 1.** The IDF continued to target Hezbollah weapons launchers, weapons storage facilities, and other military infrastructure across Lebanon.\[58\] The IDF’s air campaign concentrated airstrikes primarily on southern Lebanon but also continued to target sites in the Bekaa Valley."

At least four people have been killed and dozens of others wounded in an Israeli air attack on a hospital complex in central Gaza where displaced Palestinians sought shelter from Israel’s assault on the besieged territory.

The attack in the early hours of Monday struck the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital complex in Deir el-Balah and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp.

The Israeli military confirmed that hospitals were also included in its evacuation orders, adding that it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers.

Fares Abu Hamza, an official with Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service, told The Associated Press news agency that bodies of a “large number of martyrs” remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble in the north.

“We are unable to reach them,” he said, adding that dogs were eating some remains.

Israel launched its offensive on Gaza after Hamas led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 others as hostages, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.

Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 42,200 people, mostly women and children, and injured about 98,400, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Gaza’s Media Office said it was the seventh time this year that Israel has hit the grounds of Al-Aqsa Hospital and the third in the past couple of weeks, killing Palestinians who were forced to flee their homes.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said more than 20 tents were destroyed in the attack.

“There were many people inside the tents as the fire spread, who could not be saved,” he said. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent sites, alleging armed groups were using them.

“What happened was that we woke up to smoke, flames, fire and burning pieces falling on the tents from every direction. The explosions terrified us in our tents and outside where we live behind Al-Aqsa Hospital,” Om Ahmad Radi, a survivor at the scene, told Al Jazeera.

“The fire trucks couldn’t get here. The amount of fire and explosions was enormous."

Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'

Watch: People battle to put out fires after Israeli strike hits Gaza hospital tent camp

**Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting**

Witnesses to an Israeli air strike and resulting fire at a tent camp in a Gaza hospital compound have shared with the BBC their horror and helplessness at seeing people injured and killed in the flames.

One mother called it “one of the worst scenes we’ve witnessed”, while an injured girl said she heard screaming as people tore down their tent to get them out. The military said the incident was under review.

Charity Doctors without Borders (MSF), which has staff working at al-Aqsa, told the BBC “it had no knowledge“ of a Hamas centre and said “the hospital functions as a hospital”.

The UN's humanitarian affairs agency said in a statement that “people burned to death” and “atrocities must end”, while a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council called the footage “disturbing”.

"The images and video of what appear to be displaced civilians burning alive following an Israeli air strike are deeply disturbing and we have made our concerns clear to the Israeli government,” the spokesperson told the BBC’s partner CBS.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties — and what happened here is horrifying, even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

BBC Verify analyses footage from Gaza strikes

Witnesses said the strike happened at about 01:15 local time on Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

It hit an area between buildings filled with makeshift shelters, next to an outdoor outpatient waiting area that had no one there at night, Anna Halford, MSF's emergency coordinator in Gaza who was not at the hospital during the strike, said in a phone call from Deir al-Balah.

Hiba Radi, a mother who was living in a tent behind the hospital, told a BBC freelancer in Gaza she woke up to the sound of “explosions and fires erupting around the tents”.

“There were explosions everywhere, and we were shocked at whether this was gas or weapons,” she said.

“This is one of the worst scenes we've witnessed and lived through," she added. A man said he had "broken down" as he was "unable to do anything" to help those who burned to death.

The strike hit the al-Aqsa Hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, in the early hours of Monday, igniting a fire that burned makeshift shelters for displaced people.

At least four people were killed and dozens injured, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The BBC has verified the location of a video that shows what appears to be a person on fire. Other footage captures people rushing to extinguish the flames amid screams and explosions sending fireballs into the night sky.

The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas fighters operating inside a command centre in the car park, after which a fire broke out "likely due to secondary explosions". The people next to us tore down the tent to get us out,” she said.

Her grandmother said the family “lost their tent and everything they had; they have nothing left”.

The health ministry reported on Monday that more than 40 people were injured and four killed.

MSF on Tuesday shared a higher toll, saying five people had died, their bodies burned by the time they were recovered, and 65 injured.

Forty of the injured - 22 men, eight women and 10 children - stayed at al-Aqsa. It stays with you,” she said.

Monday’s strike was the seventh on the hospital site since March, and the third in two weeks, Ms Halford said.

When she arrived at the hospital after the most recent hit, she said she found people picking through twisted metal and burned debris to salvage any belongings.

Another mother the BBC spoke to whose children suffered burns injuries had already evacuated from north Gaza - and now has nothing.

The acting chief of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the strike occurred in an area where north Gaza residents had been told to relocate.

“There really is no safe place in Gaza for people to go,” the statement read.

Atia Darwish, a photographer who recorded some of the verified videos, told the BBC it was a “big shock” and he was “unable to do anything” watching people burn.

“I was so broken down,” he said.

Um Yaser Abdel Hamid Daher, who also lives at the hospital, told the BBC “we've seen so many people burning that we started feeling like we might burn like them”.

The injured included her son, and his wife and children. The others were transferred to different hospitals, with eight going to a specialist burns unit.

Ms Halford said her colleagues were treating burns victims ”who will almost certainly not survive", saying “there is very little you can do for burn victims of that severity”.

“You come home with the smell of it on your clothes. "We’ve never seen destruction like this before. Her granddaughter Lina, 11, who had shrapnel in her hand and leg injuries, said she had heard people screaming.

”Our neighbour’s daughter was injured in her head and her dad was killed."

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

TPO - Các chính trị gia Israel tuyên bố Iran sẽ phải “trả giá” vì vụ tấn công bằng máy bay không người lái vào nhà của Thủ tướng Benjamin Netanyahu mà họ gọi là nỗ lực ám sát.

Ba chiếc [máy bay không người lái](https://tienphong.vn/tag/m%c3%a1y+bay+kh%c3%b4ng+ng%c6%b0%e1%bb%9di+l%c3%a1i.tpo "máy bay không người lái")
 được phóng từ Li-băng vào khu [nhà riêng](https://tienphong.vn/post-1683835.tpo)
 của Thủ tướng Israel trong sáng 19/10. Hai chiếc bị đánh chặn, nhưng chiếc thứ 3 phát nổ ở Caesarea, thị trấn nghỉ dưỡng nơi tập trung những căn biệt thự hạng sang và các công trình kiến trúc thời La Mã.

Thủ tướng Netanyahu và phu nhân không ở nhà vào thời điểm xảy ra vụ tấn công.

Trang _Axios_ đưa tin chiếc máy bay không người lái đã lao vào nhà của ông Netanyahu. “Đây là lần đầu tiên kể từ khi bắt đầu cuộc chiến, một mục tiêu liên quan trực tiếp đến ông Netanyahu bị khoá mục tiêu”, _Axios_ viết.

Báo _Guardian_ cũng đưa tin chiếc máy bay không người lái đã rơi trúng ngôi nhà, gây hư hỏng ở phần ngoài.

Sau khi xác nhận nhà của mình bị máy bay không người lái tấn công, Thủ tướng Netanyahu tuyên bố “các điệp viên Iran cố ám sát tôi và vợ tôi hôm nay đã phạm một sai lầm nghiêm trọng”

Nhiều bộ trưởng và nghị sĩ đối lập cũng đưa ra phát biểu tương tự, cảnh báo Iran sẽ phải hối tiếc về hành động của lực lượng đồng minh Hezbollah.

Vụ tấn công về cơ bản là đã nhắm vào “nhà nước Israel và các biểu tượng của chính phủ”, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Israel Yoav Gallant tuyên bố.

Trong khi đó, Iran tách mình khỏi vụ tấn công và nói rằng đây là hành động của Hezbollah, còn Hezbollah vẫn chưa nhận trách nhiệm.

Phái đoàn thường trực Iran tại Liên Hợp Quốc tuyên bố “đã đáp trả Israel”, ngụ ý nói đến vụ phóng hàng trăm tên lửa đạn đạo ngày 1/10. Phái đoàn khẳng định rằng “hành động đang bị nghi ngờ là do lực lượng Hezbollah ở Li-băng” thực hiện.

Ngoại trưởng Israel Israel Katz nhấn mạnh vụ tấn công bằng máy bay không người lái cho thấy “bộ mặt thật” của Iran và “trục ma quỷ” mà nước này lãnh đạo. Ông cũng bác bỏ phát biểu của phái đoàn Iran.

“Lực lượng đại diện hàng đầu mà Iran tạo ra, tài trợ, vũ trang, huấn luyện và kiểm soát bỗng nhiên bị mô tả như một tổ chức độc lập. Những lời nói dối và giả vờ đó sẽ không giúp gì đâu – các ông sẽ phải chịu trách nhiệm”, ông Katz viết trong bài đăng trên mạng xã hội X.

_Kênh 12_ của Israel đưa tin, Israel muốn dùng vụ tấn công nhằm vào ông Netanyahu như một lý do để “tăng tính chính đáng cho việc mở rộng mục tiêu tấn công”, khi Israel tiến hành chiến dịch đáp trả Tehran vì vụ phóng tên lửa ngày 1/10.

Ông Netanyahu đã trao đổi với ứng viên tổng thống đảng Cộng hoà Mỹ Donald Trump sau vụ tấn công, Văn phòng thủ tướng Israel nói với báo _Times of Israel_. Ông cũng đã có cuộc trao đổi qua điện thoại với Chủ tịch Hạ viện Mỹ Mike Johnson.

“Tôi nói với ông ấy rằng Mỹ ủng hộ mạnh mẽ Israel và nhắc lại cam kết của chúng tôi sẽ giúp họ đối phó với Iran và các lực lượng đại diện”, ông Johnson viết trong bài đăng trên mạng X.

Báo chí Israel dẫn nguồn tin cho biết, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ Antony Blinken sẽ đến Israel vào đầu tuần tới, nhân chuyến công tác đến Trung Đông.

IRANSKI balistički projektili ciljali su danas privatnu rezidenciju izraelskog premijera Benjamina Netanyahua u Cezareji i elektranu u Haderi, izvijestila je Al Jazeera, pozivajući se na neimenovane izraelske medije.

Tekst se nastavlja ispod oglasa

### Izraelski mediji: Svi projektili su oboreni

The Jerusalem Post i The Times of Israel izvijestili su kako nije zabilježen udar niti jednog projektila, sugerirajući da su svi oboreni. Red Alert Tzofar objavio je uzbunu za opasnost od balističkih projektila nešto poslije 15 sati.

Podsjetimo, već treći dan traje sukob Izraela i Irana nakon što je Izrael pokrenuo napade na Iran kako bi uništio njihov nuklearni program. Iran je uzvratio udarima na Izrael, a u napadima su poginuli deseci ljudi s obje strane.

_Fact check: Social media posts alleging Iranian military surveillance of Netanyahu have been proven false. Know more_

!Fact check: Viral post claiming Iranian drone tracked Netanyahu proven false; Know more <image:12275>

The viral image of Netanyahu | X

In June, Israel launched a surprise military strike on Iran, triggering a swift counterattack from Tehran. What began as a sudden escalation quickly spiralled into a prolonged and intense exchange, with the United States entering the fray through a series of coordinated airstrikes on Iranian targets over several weeks. The conflict reached a critical point when Iran retaliated with a missile strike on U.S. military bases in Qatar, raising fears of a broader regional war.

Twelve days after the Iranian missile strike, both Iran and the United States agreed to a cease-fire, temporarily halting hostilities and opening the door for potential negotiations aimed at de-escalation.

Amidst this, a viral post began circulating online, claiming that the Iranian military was secretly tracking every move of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A screenshot, allegedly from the X handle 'From Iran,' is being widely shared. It features an image of Netanyahu sitting in a room, appearing to be taken from outside with a drone.

The post accompanying the image reads:

“The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps captures a photo of the Israeli Prime Minister inside his office, publishes it, and writes: “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, upon investigation, it was found that several users on X had shared the same screenshot. Our verification revealed that the claim is false.

Screenshot of the circulating X-post

> [](https://twitter.com/x/status/1939964925897589186)

The image in the viral post shows Benjamin Netanyahu sitting in a room, viewed through a half-open window, with another person seated beside him. It is being circulated with the claim that it was captured by a drone. The shadow of the alleged drone appears on the closed window and the outer wall, making the image seem convincing at first glance. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that this image was released by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

A detailed investigation traced the original image to the stock photo website Getty Images, where it was uploaded on February 10, 2009. The accompanying caption states that the photo was taken on February 8, 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu, at his home in Jerusalem. The photographer is credited as Michael Fattal.

A comparison between Michael Fattal’s original photo and the viral screenshot reveals clear similarities. Netanyahu is seated in the same position in both images. The background elements, including the curtain and the framed picture on the wall, are identical. In the viral screenshot, only the arm of the person sitting next to Netanyahu is visible, which matches the father's dress in the original photo. A green-covered book on the table in front of Netanyahu is also visible in both images.

These details confirm that the original 2009 image by Michael Fattal has been edited and falsely circulated as if it were a recent drone-captured photo.

![placeholder](/images/placeholderimg.webp)

A comparison between the image published on Getty Images in 2009 and the one currently circulating on X reveals that the claim is false.

A thorough examination confirms that the viral image is an edited version of a photo taken by Michael Fattal in February 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu with his father.

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

Questions and Answers: Israeli Military’s Use of Digital Tools in Gaza

[![A technologist with the Israeli military's Matzpen operational data and applications unit works at his station, at an Israel Defense Force base in Ramat Gan, Israel, June 11, 2023. The Israeli military reportedly uses surveillance technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital tools to help determine who or what to attack in Gaza and when.

Human Rights Watch found that four digital tools that the Israeli military is using in Gaza use faulty data and inexact approximations to inform military actions. Some tools rely on machine learning, which is the use of computerized systems that can draw inferences from data and recognize patterns without explicit instructions.

It has not been possible to document when and where these digital tools are being used or the extent to which these tools have been used in conjunction with other methods of information and intelligence collection. Based on reports, Israeli military officers are responsible for setting the threshold beyond which an individual can be marked as a target subject to attack.

The military has acknowledged the existence of a tool like Lavender [in very general terms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-defence-forces-response-to-claims-about-use-of-lavender-ai-database-in-gaza)
, calling it a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources.”

A presentation and book by two Israeli officers provide important technical details. **What is** “**Where’s Daddy?**” **and how does it work?**

Based on media reports, “Where’s Daddy” is a tool that uses mobile phone location tracking to notify Israeli military operators when people who have been marked as military targets enter a specific location – according to reports, often a family home – where they can be attacked. A mobile phone is not a reliable proxy for a human target, as people, especially in conflict zones, may change numbers or devices during an emergency where access to networks and devices may frequently and suddenly change.

In addition, the most common methods for tracking cell phone location are through [triangulating cell tower locations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221568410_Accuracy_Characterization_of_Cell_Tower_Localization)
, called cell site location information, or through gaining access to a [mobile phone's GPS data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638960/)

 [tools](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)
 in their operations in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military’s use of these digital tools risk Israeli forces violating international humanitarian law, in particular the laws of war concerning distinction between military targets and civilians, and the need to take all feasible precautions before an attack to minimize civilian harm.

Human Rights Watch research indicates that the tools apparently rely on ongoing and systematic Israeli surveillance of all Palestinian residents of Gaza, including with data collected prior to the current hostilities in a manner that is incompatible with international human rights law."

How Israeli intelligence tracked Iranian leaders in June strike? NYT reveals
============================================================================

30 August 2025 18:29

**Israel developed a new method for targeting key Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists during the 12-day conflict in June 2025.**

An analysis by The New York Times **[revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/us/politics/israel-iran-assassination.html)
** that Israeli intelligence tracked high-ranking Iranian officials by monitoring the cell phones of bodyguards accompanying them. This strategy went undetected by Iran’s security and intelligence agencies.

On June 16, Israeli military aircraft struck an underground bunker on a mountainside in Tehran during an emergency session of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Share it on social media!

!loading <image:12324> Present in the bunker were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the head of the judiciary, ministers of interior, defence, and intelligence, along with senior military commanders. While the leaders survived, several security personnel were killed in the explosions.

The attacks were part of a larger Israeli operation aimed at infiltrating the upper levels of the Iranian security apparatus. Intelligence experts also noted that the information the guards shared on social media inadvertently revealed the leaders’ whereabouts.

The operation was intended to eliminate top Iranian military officials in a secretive strike reminiscent of the notorious “Red Wedding” scenario from Game of Thrones.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

Revealed: Israeli military creating ChatGPT-like tool using vast collection of Palestinian surveillance data
============================================================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

The powerful new AI model is designed to analyze intercepted communications – but experts say such systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes

Israel’s military surveillance agency has used a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian communications to build a powerful artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT that it hopes will transform its spying capabilities, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal.

The joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found Unit 8200 trained the AI model to understand spoken Arabic using large volumes of telephone conversations and text messages, obtained through its extensive surveillance of the occupied territories.

According to sources familiar with the project, the unit began building the model to create a sophisticated chatbot-like tool capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring and providing insights into the massive volumes of surveillance data it collects.

The elite eavesdropping agency, comparable in its capabilities with the US National Security Agency (NSA), accelerated its development of the system after the start of the war in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 in October 2023. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”

Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.

The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.

A signal intelligence-gathering installation of Unit 8200, an Israeli intelligence corps unit responsible for collecting signal intelligence and code decryption, located on an observation point on the Israeli-Lebanese border near Rosh HaNikra crossing. “And ultimately these guesses can end up being used to incriminate people.”

A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the new LLM, but said the military “deploys various intelligence methods to identify and thwart terrorist activity by hostile organisations in the Middle East”.

A vast pool of Arabic-language communications
---------------------------------------------

Unit 8200 has developed an array of AI-powered tools in recent years. Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.

Initially, Israeli military intelligence struggled to build a model on this scale. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.

!An Israeli soldier from the special intelligence unit 8200 taking part in a Cyber Defense Challenge event in which teams compete against each other in stopping malicious hackers from invading vital infrastructures in a simulation game. The UK’s spy agencies [are also developing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/01/uk-intelligence-spy-agencies-relax-burdensome-laws-ai-data-bpds)
 their own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.

But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.

One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.

Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.

Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining \[an\] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.

Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.

Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.

In February, the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108)
 AI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls. It is not clear whether it has yet been deployed.

The efforts to build the large language model (LLM) – a deep learning system that generates human-like text – were partially revealed in a little-noticed public talk by a former military intelligence technologist who said he oversaw the project.

“We tried to create the largest dataset possible \[and\] collect all the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic,” the former official, Chaked Roger Joseph Sayedoff, told an audience at a military AI conference in Tel Aviv last year."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, including mobile phone location tracking via cell tower triangulation and GPS data, as well as monitoring social media activity. While the initial evidence suggests a possible link between WhatsApp and the assassination, the new evidence broadens the scope of potential tracking methods used by Israeli intelligence.

The claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The new evidence provides context on the methods used by Israeli intelligence, but it does not directly confirm or deny the use of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

To verify the claim, specific evidence linking WhatsApp to the tracking of Haniyeh is needed.

An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Human Rights Watch article ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)) discusses the Israeli military's use of digital tools, including mobile phone location tracking, using methods like cell tower triangulation and GPS data access (<image:k>). A Caliber.Az article ([https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike](https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike)) mentions Israeli intelligence tracking Iranian leaders by monitoring their bodyguards' cell phones and social media activity (<image:12313>, <image:12315>, <image:12317>, <image:12319>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance)) reports on the Israeli military's use of AI, including a ChatGPT-like tool and Unit 8200's analysis of intercepted communications for target selection (<image:12325>, <image:12326>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, including mobile phone location tracking via cell tower triangulation and GPS data, as well as monitoring social media activity. While the initial evidence suggests a possible link between WhatsApp and the assassination, the new evidence broadens the scope of potential tracking methods used by Israeli intelligence.

The claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The new evidence provides context on the methods used by Israeli intelligence, but it does not directly confirm or deny the use of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

To verify the claim, specific evidence linking WhatsApp to the tracking of Haniyeh is needed.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

A Caliber.Az article ([https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike](https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike)) mentions Israeli intelligence tracking Iranian leaders by monitoring their bodyguards' cell phones and social media activity (<image:12313>, <image:12315>, <image:12317>, <image:12319>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, including mobile phone location tracking via cell tower triangulation and GPS data, as well as monitoring social media activity. While the initial evidence suggests a possible link between WhatsApp and the assassination, the new evidence broadens the scope of potential tracking methods used by Israeli intelligence.

The claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The new evidence provides context on the methods used by Israeli intelligence, but it does not directly confirm or deny the use of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

To verify the claim, specific evidence linking WhatsApp to the tracking of Haniyeh is needed.

From waterproof, heavy-duty men’s rain jackets to windproof men’s ski jackets and casual men’s fleece jackets for daily wear, our [jackets](https://www.patagonia.com/shop/category/jackets)
 and vests are crafted to keep up.

Hardworking Men’s Vests for Daily Wear
--------------------------------------

No need for sleeves? Find your new go-to and wear it out—then repair it and wear it some more.

From Men’s Rain Jackets to Men’s Parkas
---------------------------------------

If you’re looking for a casual men’s jacket, choose one you’ll wear again and again (and again). Our midweight technical men’s jackets are made for movement, with breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics that resist abrasion and rough weather. We make men’s fleece jackets that are wind-resistant and heat-trapping for cold days outdoors—you can rely on them as outerwear or as a warm midlayer in icy temps.

Photo of Turkish man holding hand of dead daughter underlines earthquake despair

Image showing father from Kahramanmaraş region comes as death toll from Syria and Turkey quake pushes past 7,800

Videos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 7,800 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks concertinaing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a [castle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/fears-for-ancient-sites-after-earthquake-destroys-parts-of-gaziantep-castle-turkey)
 that had stood for almost two millennia.

But few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmaraş, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.

Sitting hunched in the rubble, Mesut Hancer keeps hold of 15-year-old Irmak as she lies on her bed beneath the slabs of concrete, smashed windows and broken bricks that were once apartments. Close to the father and daughter, a man with a sledgehammer tries to smash his way through the ruins.

The epicentre of the first earthquake was the Pazarcık district of Kahramanmaraş, which lies in south-east [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey)
. The initial, 7.8-magnitude earthquake was followed, hours later, by a second quake that measured 7.7 magnitude.

Elsewhere in Kahramanmaraş province, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble. One lay on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Rescuers quieted the throngs of people trying to help so they could hear survivors and find them.

On the other side of the border, the Associated Press described seeing a Syrian man holding a dead girl in his arms as he walked away from the debris of a collapsed two-storey building.

He and a woman set the girl on the floor under covering to protect her from the rain, wrapping her in a large blanket before looking back to the building. According to Agence France-Presse, [a newborn baby was pulled alive from the rubble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/syria-newborn-still-joined-to-dead-mother-pulled-alive-from-earthquake-rubble)
 of a home in northern Syria after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday’s quake.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by dozens of continuing aftershocks, freezing winter weather and the damage caused to roads leading in and out of the affected areas.

On Tuesday evening, the Turkish government said 4,500 people had been killed in the quake, with another 26,000 injured. The number of confirmed deaths on the Syrian side of the border – where the disaster has exacerbated the destruction wrought by more than 11 years of civil war – stood at at least 1,700 bringing the death toll in both countries to more than 6,200. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes disaster zones, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.

As men clamber over the ruins of the pancaked building, now shaped like a pyramid of rubble, one man sits still. 

Wearing an orange coat to protect himself from the winter freeze, Mesut Hançer perches on concrete slabs and twisted rebar — all that remains of the apartment block in Kahramanmaras, a Turkish city close to [the epicenter of Monday’s earthquake](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/oliveburd/turkey-syria-earthquake-photos)
. 

His face is still — his expression, blank. He is grief-stricken but resolute: He won’t let go of his daughter’s hand. 

  ! <image:12479>

Irmak, 15, was killed when the building collapsed. The girl’s body is sandwiched between a mattress, dirt, and the colossal weight of the upper floors of the building. All that peeks out is a lifeless, pale hand that her father steadfastly grips. 

“He never left the hand of his daughter who died in the earthquake,” wrote Adem Atlan, the photographer with Agence France-Presse who took the pictures of the grieving father on Tuesday, in an Instagram story uploaded Wednesday. 

"Unbelievable pain," he later [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CochRLEq1H8/)
.

Altan’s photos [went viral online](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1622977020194959360)
 and were printed on newspaper front pages around the world on Wednesday from Turkey to Spain to the UK to the US. 

“With the courage of despair,” read the headline accompanying the photo in [Belgium's De Standaard newspaper](https://www.standaard.be/krant/archief)
. 

“A glimpse of pain and desperation among the ruins,” Brazil’s O Globo paper wrote in its headline for the picture. 

A 2015 photo of Mesut and Irmak uploaded by the girl [to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=846968168721806&set=pb.100002258936209.-2207520000.&type=3)
 shows the father and daughter smiling as they pose by a small water fountain. Almost eight years later, a different photo of the pair has been seen across the globe and become a defining image of tragedy.

Irmak is just one of a horrifyingly large number of people killed by Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has devastated large swaths of Turkey and neighboring Syria.

More than 20,000 people are known to have died, according to [tallies from the Associated Press on Thursday](https://apnews.com/article/politics-syria-government-damascus-turkey-6ba6f153102945d93340dbf55e63d4bf)
, making the disaster one of the deadliest of the last decade. 

There are few more traumatized corners of the globe that the quake could have struck than Syria’s northwest. 

That country, plagued for more than a decade by a civil war that has wrought devastation and triggered a global refugee crisis, already had 15 million people in need of humanitarian aid even before the tremor began, according to David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.

“One of the deadliest earthquakes this century, followed by hundreds of aftershocks, now adds to a litany of devastation,” Miliband said in a statement shared with BuzzFeed News, calling for aid to begin “skyrocketing” in order to meet the desperate need.

Search and rescue efforts in the Besnaya district of Idlib, Syria, on Thursday. 

On Thursday, three days after the quake, the first convoy of aid trucks finally reached the opposition-held Idlib area in Syria’s northwest. The trucks arrived via the only crossing with the Turkish border that the United Nations has authorized for use but that had been blocked for days by damage.  

However, the White Helmets, a humanitarian group that assists in the region, said the aid was merely the same supplies that had preceded the disaster. “It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble,” the group [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1623667466860740608)
. “We are disappointed at a time when we are desperate for equipment that will help us save lives from under the rubble.”

Almost 2,000 people have died in the region, according to the White Helmets. Many of the dead had fled destruction and violence elsewhere in Syria only to lose their lives when buildings collapsed there.

As time passes, hopes dim that more people will be found alive — but there are still miracles. On Thursday, the White Helmets shared a photo of a young girl named Sham being pulled from the rubble. The group said her two siblings were also saved, but their mother was killed. 

Among the international figures who have arrived in the region to assist in relief and recovery efforts are a small contingent of 87 rescue workers from Ukraine, which itself has been plagued by war for the past year.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

 [! The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

**The quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is fake. No such statement appears on any of the actor’s official pages, nor has it been reported by any reputable media outlet.**

The quote about the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government, allegedly made by Dwayne Johnson, is fabricated. Johnson expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.

__Screenshot of Dwayne Johnson’s post__

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)
 by the organization Snopes.

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

**About the Source:**

Among others, the fake quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is being spread by a Facebook account belonging to [Zaal Mamatsashvili](https://www.facebook.com/zaal.mamatsashvili/posts/pfbid02ZV5icDdtmZzamBaPfkzkBa1LbrBuTVdevkkWGkfsuRSLoZVoFnzTAvrBqKq47j7l)

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is used as the cover art for the song "Jewish Rock" by Shawn Pelofsky. The image is not an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag in support of Israel. The evidence also shows that a quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson about Israel is fake. However, Dwayne Johnson has shown support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.
