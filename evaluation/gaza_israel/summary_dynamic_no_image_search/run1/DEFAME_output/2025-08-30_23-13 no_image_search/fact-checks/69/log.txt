Useful result: From [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa): 
Content: FRANCE 24 reports on Israeli strikes and ground incursions in Syria, including the Tasil area, near Nawa. The article mentions an Israeli operation in the Tasil area, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure". The article also mentions that the Israeli military responded to fire from gunmen. The article was published on April 3, 2025. <image:10237> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:10237> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Reverse image searches show the image has been used in articles from 2018, 2021, and January 2025, predating the February 2025 date in the claim. While web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including Tasil, the evidence does not confirm the exact date or the specific context of the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
