## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. government is assisting Americans in Lebanon by providing information on flights and offering emergency loans, as reported by [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) (![image 11485](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597908-579002.jpg), ![image 11486](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597908-898695.jpg), ![image 11487](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597909-078000.jpg), ![image 11488](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597909-392841.jpg)), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel) (![image 11489](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597913-352384.jpg), ![image 11490](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597913-851342.jpg), ![image 11491](media/2025-08-30_23-51-1756597914-429344.jpg)), and [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-10-03/us-arranges-flights-to-bring-americans-out-of-lebanon-as-others-seek-escape) (<image:0>). These reports, published in early October 2024, highlight the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as the reason for the U.S. assistance.

U.S. News & World Report also mentions that the U.S. government arranged flights to bring approximately 350 Americans and their immediate relatives out of Lebanon.


### Evidence from `web_search`
ABC News reported on October 12, 2023, that the U.S. government is arranging chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe (![image 11536](media/2025-08-30_23-53-1756598005-431610.jpg)). PBS also reported on October 12, 2023, that the Biden administration will arrange charter flights out of Israel to sites in Europe for U.S. citizens, starting the next day. The State Department is working on whether the flights will be free.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including information on flights and emergency loans, as tensions escalate between Israel and Hezbollah in October 2024. The U.S. government arranged flights to bring Americans out of Lebanon.

In October 2023, the U.S. government arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe. The State Department was working on whether the flights would be free.

The claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The evidence only mentions flights for American citizens.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/): 
Content: The search result from CBS News discusses the evacuation of Americans from Israel. Birthright Israel evacuated approximately 1,500 program participants. Charter flights were organized by not-for-profits. Two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens. The U.S. State Department placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. Ron DeSantis landed in Tampa, Florida, carrying hundreds of Americans.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon in October 2024. It also confirms that the U.S. government arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel in October 2023.

The evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights. The search results focus on the evacuation of American citizens.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate, but the part about flying Israeli citizens is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check confirms that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans for flights out of Lebanon and arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is providing assistance to Americans in Lebanon, including loans for flights, as tensions escalate in October 2024, as reported by [The Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel/). Additionally, the U.S. arranged chartered flights for American citizens out of Israel in October 2023, as reported by [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725) and [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/video/nj-reax-1697140518/). However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights.
