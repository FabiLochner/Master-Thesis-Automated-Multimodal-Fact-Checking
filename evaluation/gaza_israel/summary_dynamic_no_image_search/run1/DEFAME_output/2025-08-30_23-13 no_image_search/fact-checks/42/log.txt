Content: PBS News published an article on March 6, 2025, discussing Hamas's response to Donald Trump's "last warning" regarding the Israeli hostages. Trump's warning, issued after meeting with former hostages, demanded the immediate release of all hostages and the return of the deceased. Hamas reiterated its stance that it would only free the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The article mentions a ceasefire agreement reached in January, which included negotiations for a second phase involving the release of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. <image:11259>
