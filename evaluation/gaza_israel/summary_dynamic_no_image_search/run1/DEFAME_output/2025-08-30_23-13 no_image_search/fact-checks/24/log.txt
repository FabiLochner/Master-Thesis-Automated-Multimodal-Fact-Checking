The fact-check found that the black band was present on UNRWA's social media profiles before Sinwar's death.

The rating is False.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cjpmemap.ca/alert_2024_10_18_ai_national_post): 
Content: The National Post published an opinion piece by Vivian Bercovici that included a debunked claim that Yahya Sinwar was carrying an UNRWA identity card. The Canadian Palestinian organization CJPME refuted the claim, stating that it is designed to spread disinformation.

The claim '<image:10213> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checks from DW.com ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)) and The Canadian Press News ([https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/fact_checking/black-band-on-unrwas-social-media-profiles-appeared-before-yahya-sinwars-death/article_33032eb2-f64b-55c6-8a57-3289e6a014cf.html](https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/fact_checking/black-band-on-unrwas-social-media-profiles-appeared-before-yahya-sinwars-death/article_33032eb2-f64b-55c6-8a57-3289e6a014cf.html)) demonstrate that the black band on UNRWA's profile photo predates Yahya Sinwar's death and represents solidarity with war victims.

So, the overall veracity is: false
