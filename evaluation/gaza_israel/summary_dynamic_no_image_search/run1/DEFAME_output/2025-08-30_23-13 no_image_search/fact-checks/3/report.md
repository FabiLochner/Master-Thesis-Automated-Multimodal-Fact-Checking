## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Diplomat ([https://thediplomat.com/2025/02/unruly-israeli-visitors-thai-resentment-and-potential-dangers/](https://thediplomat.com/2025/02/unruly-israeli-visitors-thai-resentment-and-potential-dangers/)) discusses the presence of Israeli nationals in Pai District, Mae Hong Son province, Thailand, in February 2025, mentioning an incident involving Israeli men at a hospital and concerns about the Israeli community's size and potential security implications. The Nation Thailand ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) refutes claims of an Israeli "promised land" in Pai, stating that Israeli tourists visit legally and that there is a Chabad House catering to Jewish tourists. The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reports that police found no evidence of Israeli influence, settlements, or business dominance in Pai.

The articles mention the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Mae Hong Son province, Thailand, in February 2025, with some sources discussing incidents and concerns about the community. Other sources refute claims of permanent settlements and dominance, clarifying that Israeli tourists visit legally. The Bangkok Post states that all local businesses in Pai are owned by Thais. ![image 10199](media/3.jpg), ![image 10281](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595665-173482.jpg), ![image 10275](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595661-984567.jpg), ![image 10279](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595663-935279.jpg), ![image 10273](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595659-082733.jpg), ![image 10274](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595660-375189.jpg), ![image 10288](media/2025-08-30_23-14-1756595679-621736.jpg)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.88, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'Palestine': 0.02, 'Argentina': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Mae Hong Son province, Thailand, in February 2025. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the individuals in the image are settlers who have stopped fighting wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The evidence suggests that the Israelis are tourists. The geolocation of the image is inconclusive.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it correctly identifies the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025. However, the claim's assertion about the Israelis' background and their status as settlers is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, but does not support the claim that they are settlers who have stopped fighting wars. The image's geolocation is inconclusive. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. While the evidence confirms the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, as reported by sources like [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/02/unruly-israeli-visitors-thai-resentment-and-potential-dangers/), it does not support the assertion that they are settlers who have stopped fighting wars. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the Israelis are tourists, and the geolocation of the image is inconclusive.
