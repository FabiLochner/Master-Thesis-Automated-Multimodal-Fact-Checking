The claim '<image:10199> This image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and moved to become 'settlers' in Pai District, Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand, in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While the evidence confirms the presence of Israelis in Pai District, Thailand, in February 2025, as reported by sources like [The Diplomat](https://thediplomat.com/2025/02/unruly-israeli-visitors-thai-resentment-and-potential-dangers/), it does not support the assertion that they are settlers who have stopped fighting wars. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the Israelis are tourists, and the geolocation of the image is inconclusive.

So, the overall veracity is: false
