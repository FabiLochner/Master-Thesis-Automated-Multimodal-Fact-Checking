Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The article from Mondoweiss, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll was published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. The article also mentions a Channel 12 report.

The claim '<image:10249> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, as confirmed by multiple sources, including cedmohub.eu ([https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/](https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/)) and cbsaustin.com ([https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza](https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/squad-member-shares-fake-poll-claiming-most-israelis-support-rape-of-palestinians-rashida-tlaib-noura-erakat-alex-zeldin-ritchie-torres-israel-palestine-hamas-war-terrorism-gaza)). The original poll did not ask the question about soldiers and rape, and Channel 12 denied broadcasting the poll.

So, the overall veracity is: false
