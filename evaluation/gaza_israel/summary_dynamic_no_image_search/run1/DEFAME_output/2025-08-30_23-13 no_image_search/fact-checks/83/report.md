## Elaboration
The claim states the image was taken in September 2024 during the Gaza war. However, the reverse image search and web search results indicate the image was taken on February 16, 2023. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date.


## Final Judgement
The image was taken on February 16, 2023, before the Gaza war started on October 7, 2023. The claim is therefore inaccurate regarding the date. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts FC Barcelona's president with Israeli embassy representatives, taken on February 16, 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/spanish/noticias-del-mundo/article-837650) and Ynet. This predates the Gaza war, which began on October 7, 2023, making the claim's date inaccurate.
