The Tienphong.vn article discusses a drone attack on Netanyahu's house, while the Index.hr article reports on Iranian ballistic missiles targeting the residence (![image 12175](media/2025-08-31_00-16-1756599362-994463.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it is not from a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. The image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a 2020 article.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, dating back to 2019, as reported by _Times of Israel_ in 2020 ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)). Therefore, the claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is false.
