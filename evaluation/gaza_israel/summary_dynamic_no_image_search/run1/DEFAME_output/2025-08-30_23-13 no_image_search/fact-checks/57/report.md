Content: Quds News Network reports that Palestinian infant Sham, daughter of Dr. Imad Muharab, died from injuries sustained in an Israeli bombing of her grandfather's house in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood of eastern Gaza City, which resulted in the amputation of her right hand. ![image 11552](media/2025-08-30_23-54-1756598043-504006.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that Sham Imad Muhareb, the baby in the image, did lose her right hand due to injuries sustained in an Israeli bombing, contradicting the claim.
