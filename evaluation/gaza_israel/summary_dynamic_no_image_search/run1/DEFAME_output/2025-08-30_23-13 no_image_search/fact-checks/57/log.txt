Useful result: From [Source](https://t.me/s/QudsNen?before=158681): 
Content: Quds News Network reports that Palestinian infant Sham, daughter of Dr. Imad Muharab, died from injuries sustained in an Israeli bombing of her grandfather's house in the Al-Shujaiya neighborhood of eastern Gaza City, which resulted in the amputation of her right hand. <image:11552>

The claim '<image:10227> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. According to the [Quds News Network](https://t.me/s/QudsNen?before=158681), Sham Imad Muhareb died from injuries sustained in an Israeli bombing, which resulted in the amputation of her right hand, directly contradicting the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
