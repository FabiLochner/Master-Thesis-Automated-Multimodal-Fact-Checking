## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on a drone strike in Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024, for which the Houthi militia claimed responsibility, resulting in one fatality. ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/g-s1-12197/drone-strikes-tel-aviv-killing-one-houthis-claim-responsibility](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/g-s1-12197/drone-strikes-tel-aviv-killing-one-houthis-claim-responsibility)) The Soufan Center also discussed a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone, which occurred in the pre-dawn hours, killing one Israeli man and wounding several others. ([https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-july-22/](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-july-22/))

Wikipedia discusses a 2024 Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, and mentions a subsequent Israeli attack on Yemen on July 20, 2024. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_2024_Israeli_attack_on_Yemen)) The image ![image 10253](media/91.jpg) is not mentioned in the search result.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 10253](media/91.jpg)) appears in multiple sources. The Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center ([FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel)) published the image in a news release on October 7, 2023, condemning attacks on Israel. The image also appears on TURDEF ([Israel Defence News - TURDEF](https://turdef.com/country/israel-news?page=5)) with the title "Second Yom Kippur War in Israel" and a release date of October 7, 2023.

The Times of Israel ([The Daily Edition | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/)) published an article on October 7, 2023, detailing the Hamas attack on Israel, which included images of the aftermath of rocket attacks. The image ![image 10253](media/91.jpg) is not mentioned in the article.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is false. The reverse image search reveals that the image was published in October 2023, in the context of the Hamas attack on Israel.


## Final Judgement
The image is not related to a Houthi attack in July 2024. The image was published in October 2023, in the context of the Hamas attack on Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim was published in October 2023, and is related to the Hamas attack on Israel, not a Houthi attack in July 2024. The reverse image search results show the image was used in news articles from October 2023, such as the one from the [Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel).
