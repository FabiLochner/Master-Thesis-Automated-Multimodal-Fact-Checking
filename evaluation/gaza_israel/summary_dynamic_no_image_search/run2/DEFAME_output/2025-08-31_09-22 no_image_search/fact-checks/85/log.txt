Content: The search result from The National Desk discusses a doctored image of a poll, which was shared by Rep. Erakat, seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12. The original image was a 2022 Channel 12 poll. The doctored image asked if a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian. The article was published on August 9, 2024. <image:6699>

Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/65-of-israeli-jews-oppose-criminal-prosecution-for-soldiers-suspected-of-raping-palestinian-detainees/): 
Content: The article from Mondoweiss, published on August 19, 2024, discusses a poll indicating that 65% of Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The poll, conducted by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies, surveyed attitudes regarding the "Swords of Iron" operation. The article mentions a related poll from Channel 12.

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll. The original footage was from Channel 12, but the question about soldier rape was fabricated and debunked by Channel 12 on August 9, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
