## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 13](media/15.jpg)) shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." According to a CBC News article from July 25, 2024, and a Globe and Mail article from July 24, 2024, the signs were hacked to display the pro-Palestinian slogans. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism, and a group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Suburban ([https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/plante-served-over-pro-palestinian-electronic-signs/article_e0143fdc-d532-5ecf-9a66-095ad0ee8ab9.html](https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/plante-served-over-pro-palestinian-electronic-signs/article_e0143fdc-d532-5ecf-9a66-095ad0ee8ab9.html)) reports that Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante was served by a bailiff regarding electronic signs used by pro-Palestinian activists, displaying messages such as "Free Palestine" and "Escalate Now." The article mentions that the police are investigating the incident.

CTV News ([https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/montreal-mayor-says-friday-pro-palestinian-protests-were-taken-over-by-professional-vandals/](https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/montreal-mayor-says-friday-pro-palestinian-protests-were-taken-over-by-professional-vandals/)) and CBC News ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/plante-anti-nato-protest-1.7392719](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/plante-anti-nato-protest-1.7392719)) also discuss Mayor Plante's comments on pro-Palestinian protests and an anti-NATO protest, respectively. The CBC News article does not mention the sign in ![image 13](media/15.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message is accurate. The reverse image search confirms the image's existence and the message displayed. The geolocation data also supports the location being in Canada.

The evidence indicates that the signs were hacked and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism. The Suburban article mentions that Mayor Plante was served regarding the signs. Therefore, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message. However, the sign was hacked, and the city considered it vandalism. The claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, as confirmed by reverse image search and geolocation. However, the sign was hacked, and the city considered it vandalism, as reported by CBC News ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809)) and The Globe and Mail ([https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/)). Therefore, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.
