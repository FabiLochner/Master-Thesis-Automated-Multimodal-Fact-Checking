The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including a report from The Daily File ([Source](https://www.thedailyfile.org/post/sham-imad-muhareb)), confirms the existence and death of Sham Imad Muhareb in Shuja'iya on April 10, 2025. However, the provided information does not mention the cause of death or whether she lost her arm, making it impossible to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
