## Claim
Claim: "![image 33](media/58.jpg) This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
geolocate(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan. The claim states that the image shows Gaza. Therefore, the claim is likely false.


## Final Judgement
The image's geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, while the claim states that the image shows Gaza. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim was geolocated to Jordan, not Gaza as the claim states, making the claim false.
