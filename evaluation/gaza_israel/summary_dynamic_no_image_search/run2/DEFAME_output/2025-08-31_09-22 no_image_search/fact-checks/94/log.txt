Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201): Found exact image on website with title: Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria
Content: The ABC News article, published on January 23, 2018, discusses the U.S. stance on chemical attacks in Syria. The article mentions that the U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, blamed the Assad regime for "crimes against humanity" and held Russia responsible for the victims of chemical attacks in Syria. The article also mentions an apparent chlorine gas attack in east Ghouta, affecting more than 20 civilians, most of them children. The article includes images of destruction in Syria <image:5766>, <image:5772> and of Rex Tillerson <image:5768>.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask over an infant, taken in January 2018 following a reported gas attack in Syria, as evidenced by a VOA News article and an ABC News article. The claim incorrectly attributes the image to the Gaza war in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
