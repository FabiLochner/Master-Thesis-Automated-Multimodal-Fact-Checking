Another article from [Ynetnews](https://www.ynetnews.com/environment/article/s1n8qjyt1x) discusses Thunberg's shift from climate activism to anti-Israel activism.



### Evidence from `web_search`
Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany, according to reports from the New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/)) and Yahoo News ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-giggles-while-saying-095000750.html)). The Telegraph also reported on the incident ([https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/10/watch-greta-thunberg-declares-f-israel-german-demonstration/)).

The New York Post article includes images of Thunberg at the rally (![image 392](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846185-389823.jpg), ![image 393](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846187-063198.jpg), ![image 394](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846189-584061.jpg), ![image 396](media/2025-07-18_13-43-1752846195-195779.jpg)). The Telegraph article also includes a photo of Thunberg at the event (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The image in the claim is not authentic. Reverse image search results show that the original image shows Greta Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Stand With Gaza."

However, Greta Thunberg did declare "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany in December 2024, as reported by the New York Post, Yahoo News, and The Telegraph.


## Final Judgement
The image of Greta Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Fuck Israel" is not authentic. However, Greta Thunberg did declare "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany.

`false`
