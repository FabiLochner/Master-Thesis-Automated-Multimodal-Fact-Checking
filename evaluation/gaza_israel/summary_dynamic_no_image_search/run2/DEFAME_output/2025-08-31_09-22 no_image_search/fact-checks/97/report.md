## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN Security Council regarding a ceasefire resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war.

To verify the claim, information about any draft reinstitution is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the topic of conscription in the United States. One source is a Wikipedia article that details the history of conscription, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the end of the draft in 1973, and mentions a 2024 meeting memo suggesting modifications to the Selective Service Act, such as registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills (<image:k>). Another source, an article published on August 8, 2024, discusses the possibility of a draft in the US and mentions public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing (<image:k>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The ABC10 article from 2025 fact-checks the claim that the US military draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war](https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war)).

A CNN article from August 20, 2025, discusses the Israeli military's manpower issues and mentions Israel calling up reservists and extending service, as well as considering drafting ultra-Orthodox men ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US did not reinstitute the draft for the Israel-Hamas war. An ABC10 article fact-checks and debunks the claim. While there were discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act and public rumors about the US being on a wartime footing, there is no evidence of the draft being reinstituted.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the US did not reinstitute the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions and rumors, a fact-check article explicitly debunked the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is false. While there were discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act and public rumors, a fact-check article from ABC10 ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)) explicitly debunked the claim.
