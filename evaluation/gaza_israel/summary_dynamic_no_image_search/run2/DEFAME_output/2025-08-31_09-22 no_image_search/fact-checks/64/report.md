Ynetnews.com ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkkoeco4xe)) reported that Qaani reappeared in Tehran on June 24, 2024, after a 12-day absence, dispelling rumors of his death in an Israeli strike ![image 11648](media/2025-08-31_10-45-1756637140-734138.jpg), ![image 11645](media/2025-08-31_10-45-1756637125-165767.jpg).

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) states that Esmail Qaani is the commander of the Quds Force, appointed in January 2020 <image:k>. The article mentions that in early October 2024, concerns emerged regarding his whereabouts.


## Elaboration
The claim that Esmail Qaani fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel is false. An article from Enlace Judío, published on April 1, 2025, states that the claim was a joke. Furthermore, evidence indicates that Qaani was seen in Tehran on multiple occasions in April and June 2025.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including Enlace Judío, The Jerusalem Post, and Ynetnews.com, provide evidence that contradicts the claim. Qaani was reported to be in Tehran and even seen at a rally. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from Enlace Judío ([https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/](https://www.enlacejudio.com/fact-check/es-falso-que-el-general-irani-email-qaani-este-en-israel/)) indicates the claim was a joke. Furthermore, reports from Press TV, The Jerusalem Post, and Ynetnews.com show Qaani in Tehran during the relevant time frame.
