## Claim
Claim: "![image 45](media/73.jpg) This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 45](media/73.jpg))
geolocate(![image 45](media/73.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 45](media/73.jpg)

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.78, 'Palestine': 0.2, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image was most likely taken in Israel or Palestine. The claim states that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria. Since the image was not taken in Syria, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image was most likely taken in Israel or Palestine, not Syria. The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria is therefore false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Israeli tanks, likely in Israel or Palestine, not in Damascus, Syria, as the claim suggests. Therefore, the claim is false.
