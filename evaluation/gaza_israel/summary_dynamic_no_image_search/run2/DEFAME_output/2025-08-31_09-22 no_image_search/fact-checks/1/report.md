## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2025 Myanmar earthquake that occurred on March 28, 2025. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7â€“7.9 and struck the Sagaing Region of Myanmar, with an epicenter near Mandalay. The earthquake destroyed nearly 50,000 residential buildings and caused a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok to collapse. The United Nations estimated that over 28 million people in the six regions required assistance.

The sources include information about the earthquake's impact, including damage, casualties, and the involvement of various countries and international organizations in providing aid. The article from disasterphilanthropy.org mentions that at least 500 Muslims were killed in mosques during prayers in Mandalay and Sagaing.
The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), ScienceDirect ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017)), and disasterphilanthropy.org ([https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2025-myanmar-and-thailand-earthquake/](https://disasterphilanthropy.org/disasters/2025-myanmar-and-thailand-earthquake/)).

## Elaboration
The web search confirms the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as stated in the claim. The search results describe the extensive damage caused by the earthquake, including the destruction of nearly 50,000 residential buildings.

However, the evidence does not include the image. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts the ruins after the 2025 Myanmar earthquake.


## Actions
```
web_search("image of 2025 Myanmar earthquake damage")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources provide information about the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, including images of the damage. NPR published an article with photos of the aftermath, including damaged buildings, rescue efforts, and a collapsed building in Bangkok (![image 11178](media/2025-08-31_09-31-1756632706-776455.jpg)

## Elaboration
The web search for images of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake damage provides evidence of the event. However, the provided image is not included in the search results. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image depicts the ruins after the 2025 Myanmar earthquake.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm the occurrence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, and describe the extensive damage. However, the image in the claim was not found in the search results. Therefore, the image's origin and the event it depicts cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is unverified. While the existence of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake is confirmed by sources like Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), the image in the claim could not be found in the search results.
