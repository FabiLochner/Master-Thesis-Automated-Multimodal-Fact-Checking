Content: The BBC News article, published on March 28, 2025, reports on a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck central Myanmar.

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the existence of the 2025 Myanmar earthquake is confirmed by sources like Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), the image in the claim could not be found in the search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
