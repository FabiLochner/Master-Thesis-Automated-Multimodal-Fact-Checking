### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss events in August 2025, including Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa, Yemen, in response to Houthi attacks on Israel. One article from Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/prime-minister-yemens-houthi-run-government-killed-israeli-strike-2025-08-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/prime-minister-yemens-houthi-run-government-killed-israeli-strike-2025-08-30/)) reports that an Israeli strike killed the prime minister of Yemen's Houthi-run government.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/28/israel-launches-latest-attacks-against-houthis-in-yemens-sanaa](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/28/israel-launches-latest-attacks-against-houthis-in-yemens-sanaa)) also discusses Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa. NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/world/yemen/israeli-airstrike-kills-houthi-prime-minister-rcna228187](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/yemen/israeli-airstrike-kills-houthi-prime-minister-rcna228187)) reports that an Israeli airstrike killed the prime minister of Yemen's rebel-controlled government. ![image 11233](media/2025-08-31_09-32-1756632766-357775.jpg) <image:k> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024, in response to a Yemeni attack on Israel's capital. The evidence indicates that on December 22, 2024, the U.S. launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, and Israel also launched strikes against Houthi-held parts of Yemen. However, the image itself is not directly linked to the events of December 22, 2024, as it was not found in the search results.

The evidence also mentions that in August 2025, there were Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa, Yemen, in response to Houthi attacks on Israel.

Based on the evidence, the claim is partially supported. The U.S. did conduct airstrikes on Yemen on December 22, 2024. However, the image's origin and its direct relation to the events described in the claim are not confirmed.

Therefore, the veracity of the claim is uncertain. More information is needed to confirm the image's context.

Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`
