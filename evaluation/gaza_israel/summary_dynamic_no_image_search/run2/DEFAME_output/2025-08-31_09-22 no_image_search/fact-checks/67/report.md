The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from [en.majalla.com](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 ![image 11679](media/2025-08-31_10-47-1756637276-986837.jpg), and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 ![image 11686](media/2025-08-31_10-48-1756637288-250779.jpg). It also mentions a meeting of Druze leaders on March 14, 2025 ![image 11685](media/2025-08-31_10-48-1756637286-795762.jpg), and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 ![image 11686](media/2025-08-31_10-48-1756637288-250779.jpg).

Another article from [mondediplo.com](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025 ![image 1](media/0.jpg), and that Greece made strides in the global fight against antisemitism in January 2025. Finally, an article from [www.timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 ![image 11692](media/2025-08-31_10-49-1756637373-724529.jpg), and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025, and gave a speech on March 30, 2025. The evidence also mentions talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, the evidence does not mention whether Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's relationship with the U.S., Israel, and Syria.  An article from [levant24.com](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/) mentions a meeting between the US Ambassador to Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Minister on May 15, 2025 ![image 11694](media/2025-08-31_10-50-1756637409-668024.jpg).  An article from [jinsa.org](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf) reports that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated."  A Reuters article from [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/) reports that on March 16, 2025, Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about Syria ![image 11695](media/2025-08-31_10-50-1756637416-710330.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that on March 16, 2025, Turkish President Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about Syria. Furthermore, on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence suggests Erdogan's strong stance against Israel and communication with the U.S. regarding Syria, but it does not confirm the specific action of urging the U.S. to control Israel.
