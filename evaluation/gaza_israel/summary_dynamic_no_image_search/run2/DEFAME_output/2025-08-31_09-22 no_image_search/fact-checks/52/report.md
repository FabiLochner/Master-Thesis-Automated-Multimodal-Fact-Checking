## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) reported that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024, with about 100,000 Palestinians leaving since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 killed in Israeli attacks. <image:k>, <image:j>. The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) also reported a 6% decline, citing the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), which indicates a decline of approximately 160,000 people. ![image 1646](media/2025-07-20_10-39-1753007954-541099.jpg)

Conversely, the New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) stated that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ![image 1632](media/2025-07-20_10-38-1753007935-200533.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a decrease of 6%. However, the New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) ([Source](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) claims an increase of 2.02%.

The NYCFPA's claim is based on growth forecasts from August 2023, which may not reflect the actual population changes due to the war. The other sources indicate a population decline, which is more likely given the circumstances.

Therefore, the claim is likely false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence presents conflicting information. While one source claims a 2.02% increase, other sources report a 6% decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023. The claim of an increase is based on pre-war forecasts and is contradicted by reports of population decline. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is contradicted by multiple sources. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) and The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)) report a population decrease, while the claim is based on pre-war forecasts.
