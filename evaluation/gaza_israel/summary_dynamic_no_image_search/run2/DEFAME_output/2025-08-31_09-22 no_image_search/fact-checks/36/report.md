The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) reported on October 6, 2024, that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited the Nevatim air force base after an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024. Gallant stated the attack "didn't even scratch" the Israeli Air Force. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected)) also mentioned the October 1st Iranian missile attack.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, codenamed Operation True Promise II, in retaliation for the assassination of leaders. Israel shot down most of the incoming missiles. The attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations of IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders. The article also mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake”.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was the Defense Minister of Israel and was fired by Prime Minister Netanyahu on November 5, 2024 ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)). The evidence also confirms that an Iranian attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024 ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected)). However, there is no information in the provided evidence to support the claim that Gallant was killed in the attack.

Therefore, the claim that Gallant was killed in the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an Iranian attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, and that Yoav Gallant was the Defense Minister of Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Gallant was killed in the attack.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While an Iranian attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, and Yoav Gallant was the Defense Minister, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was killed in the attack. In fact, he was later fired on November 5, 2024, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)).
