## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters published a fact-check article stating that Mike Tyson did not pose with the Palestinian flag before his fight against Jake Paul ([https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html)). Yahoo News, published by USA TODAY, confirms the image is fabricated, with a spokesperson for Tyson confirming its falsity ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-mike-tyson-didnt-wear-224333706.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-mike-tyson-didnt-wear-224333706.html)).

The Independent reports that the image is likely AI-generated, with no evidence of Tyson displaying the flag at the event and his publicist confirming the image's falsity ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mike-tyson-labour-angela-eagle-palestinian-jake-paul-b2652116.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/mike-tyson-labour-angela-eagle-palestinian-jake-paul-b2652116.html)). The image shows ![image 17](media/22.jpg).


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/ai-generated-image-falsely-shows-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/): Found exact image on website with title: Mike Tyson did not pose with the Palestine flag
Content: The website srilanka.factcrescendo.com published on July 20, 2025, states that the image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is AI-generated and not an authentic photo. ![image 983](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006046-292042.jpg), ![image 984](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006047-796808.jpg), ![image 985](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006049-859845.jpg), ![image 995](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006053-229773.jpg), ![image 998](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006056-765486.jpg). The website also mentions that the image was widely shared on social media, and that Fact Crescendo's team watched the fight and did not see Tyson with the flag. The website also provides a link to a TrueMedia.org analysis that indicates substantial evidence of manipulation. ![image 999](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006060-268846.jpg). The website also includes a Getty Images photo of Mike Tyson at the event without the flag. ![image 1000](media/2025-07-20_10-07-1753006064-919555.jpg).
