### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the economic impact of a potential Israel-Iran war. One article from TRT World ([https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)) mentions a 12-day war in June 2025, with Israel spending approximately $5 billion in the first week. It also includes an image of a damaged building in Beersheba, Israel ![image 11433](media/2025-08-31_10-21-1756635715-696669.jpg).

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/israel-iran-conflict-highlights-dollars-tarnished-safe-haven-appeal-2025-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/israel-iran-conflict-highlights-dollars-tarnished-safe-haven-appeal-2025-06-16/)) discusses the impact on the U.S. dollar. Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war)) discusses the economic impact of the Iranâ€“Israel war, including military spending, sanctions, and currency devaluation.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that an Iranian government official orchestrated a plot to assassinate Donald Trump. The plot involved an Afghan national. The evidence does not support the claim that the plot was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans.

The evidence does not explicitly state that Israel wants American money to fund a war with Iran or American servicemen to fight it. However, the evidence does mention the economic impact of an Israel-Iran war, including military spending.

The claim is partially inaccurate.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially inaccurate. While there was an assassination plot against Donald Trump, it was orchestrated by an Iranian government official, not two Jewish Americans. The evidence does not directly support the claim about Israel's intentions regarding a war with Iran. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially inaccurate. While there was an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the plot was orchestrated by an Iranian government official, not Jewish Americans, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department)). The evidence does not support the assertion that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran, although the economic impact of such a war is discussed in sources like TRT World ([https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)).
