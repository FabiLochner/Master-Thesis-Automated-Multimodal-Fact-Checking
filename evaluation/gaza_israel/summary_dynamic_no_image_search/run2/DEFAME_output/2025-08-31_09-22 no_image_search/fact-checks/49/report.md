## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and would meet with Benjamin Netanyahu later in the week, underscoring a commitment to Israel's defense ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/politics/harris-declined-preside-netanyahu-address)). The Washington Post reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Netanyahu addresses Congress ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-bibi-netanyahu-speech-congress/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-bibi-netanyahu-speech-congress/)).

Al-Monitor also reported on July 22, 2024, that Netanyahu was scheduled to meet with Harris, who is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ([https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/protests-kamala-harris-rise-overshadow-netanyahus-washington-visit)). ![image 11529](media/2025-08-31_10-32-1756636379-079859.jpg), ![image 11531](media/2025-08-31_10-33-1756636382-697733.jpg), ![image 11532](media/2025-08-31_10-33-1756636383-128843.jpg), ![image 11533](media/2025-08-31_10-33-1756636383-612568.jpg), ![image 11535](media/2025-08-31_10-33-1756636383-758769.jpg)


## Elaboration
The provided evidence confirms that Kamala Harris was scheduled to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not include a direct quote from Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue."

To verify the claim, I need to find a reliable source that quotes Harris making the statement on the specified date.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.ibtimes.sg/fact-check-did-kamala-harris-say-our-support-israel-will-continue-75435): 
Content: The search result from IBTimes.sg, published on July 26, 2024, fact-checks the claim that Kamala Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue." The article states that no evidence has been found of Harris using those words during Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months, and rates the claim as "False." The article mentions a post on X (formerly Twitter) that included the quote, which gained widespread attention. It also notes that Harris has supported Israel while also advocating for a cease-fire and increased humanitarian aid. <image:43822>, <image:69778>, <image:59008>


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that the claim is false. A fact-check from IBTimes.sg, published on July 26, 2024, found no evidence of Kamala Harris making the statement "Our support for Israel will continue" during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit or in recent months.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 22, 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that she stated, "Our support for Israel will continue" on that date. A fact-check from IBTimes.sg explicitly states that no such statement was found.

Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 22, 2024, there is no evidence that she stated, "Our support for Israel will continue" on that date, according to a fact-check by IBTimes.sg ([https://www.ibtimes.sg/fact-check-did-kamala-harris-say-our-support-israel-will-continue-75435](https://www.ibtimes.sg/fact-check-did-kamala-harris-say-our-support-israel-will-continue-75435)).
