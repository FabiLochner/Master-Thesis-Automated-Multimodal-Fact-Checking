Useful result: From [Source](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/german-tv-agrees-to-air-anti-semitism-documentary-following-cries-of-censorship-6-1-2017): Found exact image on website with title: German TV agrees to air anti-Semitism documentary following cries ...
Content: The World Jewish Congress website published an article on June 19, 2017, about a German TV documentary on European anti-Semitism. The article includes an image <image:6999> that is identical to the image in the claim.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/tags/adam-milstein): Found exact image on website with title: Adam Milstein | The Jerusalem Post
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article by Adam Milstein on July 27, 2023, discussing antisemitism in Europe. The article includes an image of a swastika on the base of the Statue de la République in Paris during a protest in support of Palestinians on July 26, 2014. <image:k>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from a 2014 pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris, as confirmed by a reverse image search, and therefore is not related to the 2024 French parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the 2024 elections did not result in a victory for Marine Le Pen's party, as reported by [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5025215/france-elections-2024-analysis) and [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-legislative-election-2024-second-round-front-populaire-jean-luc-melenchon-raphael-glucksmann-shock-victory/).

So, the overall veracity is: false
