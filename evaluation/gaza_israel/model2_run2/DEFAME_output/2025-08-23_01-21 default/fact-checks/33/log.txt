Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts): 
Content: The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) reports that Israel received $17.9 billion in U.S. aid. The U.S. has provided military aid to Israel, including weapons. The U.S. has also helped Israel neutralize Iranian attacks. The article mentions that the U.S. has paused a shipment of bombs to Israel due to concerns about civilian deaths in Gaza. The article also mentions that American adults are divided in their views of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Useful result: From [Source](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/papers/2024/USspendingIsrael): 
Content: Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs published a paper stating that the U.S. has spent at least $22.76 billion on Israel's military operations since October 7, 2023. This includes $17.9 billion in security assistance.

The claim 'The assassination plot to kill Donald Trump in 2024 was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. Israel wants war with Iran but wants American money to fund it and American servicemen to fight it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Evidence from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/doj-charges-three-iranian-plot-to-kill-donald-trump) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/08/nx-s1-5184549/iran-donald-trump-murder-for-hire-plot-justice-department) indicates an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump, not one orchestrated by Jewish Americans. While the U.S. provides aid to Israel, as reported by the [Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts) and Brown University's Watson Institute, the evidence does not support the assertion that Israel wants American money and servicemen for a war with Iran.

So, the overall veracity is: false
