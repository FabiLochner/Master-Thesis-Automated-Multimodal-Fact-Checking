Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09): Found exact image on website with title: Speaker Johnson demands Zelenskyy remove Ukraine's ... - AP News
Content: The Associated Press reports that on September 22, 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a Pennsylvania ammunition factory and signed military ordnance. <image:40> The article also mentions that House Speaker Mike Johnson demanded Zelenskyy remove Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. after the visit, calling it a partisan campaign event.

The claim '<image:40> This image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March 2025 signing Israeli bombs intended for use against Palestinians in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09). The ammunition was intended for Ukraine's defense, not for use by Israel in Gaza, and the event occurred in 2024, not March 2025.
