## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
A video and still images were shared online claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel in March 2025; however, the video actually shows him at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs. The video was shared on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraineâ€™s war with Russia. The Wikipedia article discusses a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, in the Oval Office. The AP News article mentions a joint press conference between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Finland's President Alexander Stubb on March 19, 2025.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania on September 23, 2024 (![image 1958](media/2025-07-20_10-54-1753008879-003048.jpg), ![image 1964](media/2025-07-20_10-54-1753008881-965155.jpg), ![image 40](media/66.jpg)). The BBC published articles about the event on September 26, 2024, and the Associated Press reported on September 25, 2024, that Zelenskyy's visit included signing military ordnance.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The ammunition was for Ukraine's defense needs, not for use by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The ammunition was for Ukraine's defense needs, not for use by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o) and the [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09). The ammunition was intended for Ukraine's defense, not for use by Israel in Gaza, and the event occurred in 2024, not March 2025.
