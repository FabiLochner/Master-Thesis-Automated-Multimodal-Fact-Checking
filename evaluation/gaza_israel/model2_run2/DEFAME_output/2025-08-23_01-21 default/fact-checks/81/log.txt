Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Memorials and services for the September 11 attacks" lists several 9/11 memorials, including the Central Kitsap 9/11 Memorial in Bremerton, Washington, and a memorial outside the Air Mobility Command Museum near Dover, Delaware. The article also mentions the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. <image:2231>, <image:2232>, <image:2233>, <image:2234>, <image:2235>, <image:2236>. The article does not explicitly state whether the Jerusalem memorial is the only one outside the US.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/september-11-memorials-slideshow): 
Content: The search result from Architectural Digest lists several 9/11 memorials, including the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, and other memorials in the US and other locations. <image:2256> The article does not state that the Jerusalem memorial is the only one outside the US.

The claim '<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, the assertion that it is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is incorrect. Multiple sources, including [Memorial Mapping](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/browse-by-country), confirm the existence of other 9/11 memorials outside the United States.

So, the overall veracity is: false
