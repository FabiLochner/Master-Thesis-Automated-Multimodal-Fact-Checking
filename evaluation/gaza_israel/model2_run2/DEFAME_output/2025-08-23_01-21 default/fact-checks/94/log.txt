Useful result: From [Source](https://www.csis.org/analysis/emerging-trends-chemical-weapons-usage-middle-east): Found exact image on website with title: Emerging Trends in Chemical Weapons Usage in the Middle East

Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/tillerson-russia-ultimately-bears-responsibility-chemical-attacks-syria/story?id=52554201): Found exact image on website with title: Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria
Content: The ABC News article, published on January 23, 2018, discusses the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's statement regarding the chemical attacks in Syria. Tillerson blamed the Assad regime for "crimes against humanity" and held Russia responsible for the victims. The article mentions an "apparent chlorine gas attack" in east Ghouta, affecting more than 20 civilians, and includes an image of a Syrian man with remnants of rockets. <image:5766>. The article also includes images of Rex Tillerson <image:5768> and other related news. The article does not contain any information about the image in the claim.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from a VOA News article ([https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-russia-us-chemical-attacks/4221637.html)) from January 2018 and shows a Syrian girl, not a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. The image's context is misrepresented.

So, the overall veracity is: false
