## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, which originally aired on May 27, 2022. The original question was not about rape, but rather, "Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?" The altered image, which falsely claims that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians, was shared on social media. (![image 5662](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913720-056562.jpg), ![image 5656](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913710-135967.jpg), ![image 5661](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913719-584314.jpg), ![image 5666](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913721-763830.jpg))

A separate poll, published by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies, showed that 65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees. The image was shared by Noura Erakat and Rashida Tlaib.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a doctored screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original question was not about rape, but rather, "Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?" The altered image falsely claims that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians.


## Final Judgement
The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll's question was different from the one presented in the image. The altered image falsely claims that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image is a manipulated screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, did not ask about rape; instead, it questioned whether the government relies on supporters of terrorism. The altered image falsely claims that most Israelis support the rape of Palestinians, as confirmed by multiple sources ([![image 5662](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913720-056562.jpg)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner), [![image 5656](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913710-135967.jpg)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner), [![image 5661](media/2025-08-23_01-48-1755913719-584314.jpg)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Channel+12+Israel+public+opinion+poll+soldier+rape+prisoner)).
