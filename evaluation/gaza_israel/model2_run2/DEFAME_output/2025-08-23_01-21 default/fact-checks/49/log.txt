Useful result: From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/07/what-kamala-harris-has-said-israel-gaza-war): 
Content: Al-Monitor published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza war. The article mentions Harris's call to protect the lives of Gaza civilians, which did not markedly differ from statements made by Biden.

The claim 'On July 22, 2024, Vice President Kamala Harris said, 'Our support for Israel will continue' amid Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to the United States.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unproven. While evidence indicates that Kamala Harris expressed support for Israel around July 22, 2024, and reaffirmed this support later, the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" from that specific date is not found in the provided sources.

So, the overall veracity is: false
