An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, and mentions unconfirmed reports suggesting that WhatsApp may have been used to track Haniyeh's location via spyware (![image 5685](media/2025-08-23_01-49-1755913768-315670.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination on July 31, 2024. There are unconfirmed reports that WhatsApp may have been used to track his location via spyware. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The Tehran Times article ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says)) mentions that Haniyeh's son stated his father used WhatsApp. The bne Gulf bureau article ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) mentions unconfirmed reports about WhatsApp being used for tracking.

The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the lack of definitive evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.
