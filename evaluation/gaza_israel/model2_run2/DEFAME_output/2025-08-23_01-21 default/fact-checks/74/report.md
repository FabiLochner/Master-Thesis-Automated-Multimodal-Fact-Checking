## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/). Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack on October 22, 2024, according to the Wikipedia article. The attack caused damage to a bedroom window, and Netanyahu and his wife were not present, with no injuries reported.

[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216) also reported on the drone strike, stating that the IDF confirmed a drone from Lebanon hit a structure in the Caesarea area. ![image 5540](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913514-658764.jpg), ![image 5541](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913515-076396.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone targeted the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in Caesarea, Israel, according to reports from NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel)) and CBS News ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drone-strike-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drone-strike-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas/)). ![image 5554](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913550-157330.jpg), ![image 5557](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913554-467085.jpg), ![image 5558](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913557-554698.jpg)

Both sources state that there were no casualties in the attack.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the provided sources do not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. The reports explicitly state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries.

Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's home on October 19, 2024, but there is no mention of Yair Netanyahu being killed. The reports state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's home in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack.
