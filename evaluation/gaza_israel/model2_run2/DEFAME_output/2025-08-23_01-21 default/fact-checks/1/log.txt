Content: The search result from Archaeology.org discusses the 2025 Myanmar earthquake and how it exposed an ancient royal structure. <image:2912>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/myanmar-earthquake-religious-cultural-sites): 
Content: National Geographic shows an image of the ruins of a religious site after the Myanmar earthquake. <image:2913>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is about an image depicting the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025. While the existence of the earthquake is confirmed by multiple sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), the image itself could not be verified through reverse image search or image search results. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
