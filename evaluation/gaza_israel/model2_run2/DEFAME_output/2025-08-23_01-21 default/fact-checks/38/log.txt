Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 1, 2024, about the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. The article includes an image of a building. <image:5342>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk): 
Content: CNN reports that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an airstrike in Iran on July 31, 2024. <image:5343>

The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While news sources such as [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/31/nx-s1-5058383/hamas-says-top-leader-killed-in-iran) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-we-know-so-far-about-assassination-hamas-leader-2024-07-31/) confirm the assassination on that date, image searches reveal different buildings associated with the event, indicating the image in the claim is not related to the assassination.

So, the overall veracity is: false
