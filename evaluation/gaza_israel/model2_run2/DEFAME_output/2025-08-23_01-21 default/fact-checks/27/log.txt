Useful result: From [Source](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market): Found exact image on website with title: Anti-Semitism in France: How Fast Is the Tide Rising? | Vanity Fair

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html): Found exact image on website with title: Anti-Semitism Rises in Europe Amid Israel-Gaza Conflict
Content: The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2014, titled "Anti-Semitism Rises in Europe Amid Israel-Gaza Conflict". The article discusses a rise in anti-Semitic incidents across Europe, including Germany and France, in the context of the conflict in Gaza. The article mentions violent attacks, hate speech, and threats targeting Jewish individuals and institutions. <image:20>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim has been used in articles about antisemitism and a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Paris in July 2014, as evidenced by sources like the [American Jewish Committee](https://www.ajc.org/news/ajc-urges-eu-nations-to-act-on-dismaying-new-antisemitism-report), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/07/anti-semitism-france-hostage-hyper-cacher-kosher-market), and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/world/europe/anger-in-europe-over-the-israeli-gaza-conflict-reverberates-as-anti-semitism.html). While there were protests in France in 2024, the image's context appears to be unrelated to the 2024 French parliamentary elections or Le Pen's victory.

So, the overall veracity is: false
