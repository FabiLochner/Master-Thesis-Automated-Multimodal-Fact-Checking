## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 39](media/65.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 39](media/65.jpg)) appears in an article from L'Orient Today ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)) about an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024. The same image is also found on bhol.co.il ([https://www.bhol.co.il/news/1666411](https://www.bhol.co.il/news/1666411)), which discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Lebanon, including reports of attacks and diplomatic actions.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image is associated with an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, according to L'Orient Today ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)). The image is not related to Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image is misattributed. The provided evidence indicates that the image is related to an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, not Deir al-Balah in March 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is misattributed. Reverse image searches reveal that the image is associated with an Israeli strike on Nabatieh, Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, as reported by L'Orient Today ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1418485/israeli-strike-on-nabatieh-at-least-7-injured-and-14-suffocated.html)), not with events in Deir al-Balah in March 2025.
