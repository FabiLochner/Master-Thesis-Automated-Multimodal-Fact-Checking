## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Judo Federation is investigating why Algerian judoka Messaoud Redouane Dris failed to make weight, preventing a match against Israeli Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, according to reports from ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) and the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)). Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics. In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine, withdrew to avoid a potential fight against Butbul. ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg) <image:i> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)
