Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996): 
Content: The DW article fact-checks the claim that UNRWA is mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar. The article states that the black ribbon on the UNRWA logo has been present since at least October 22, 2023, and was added to show solidarity with the victims of war. <image:18> The article also mentions that UNRWA has been the target of disinformation campaigns. The article was edited by Tetyana Klug.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/un-agency-refutes-israeli-media-reports-claiming-staff-member-killed-with-hamas-leader-in-gaza/3365784): 
Content: The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) refuted claims that an agency staff member was killed alongside Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in the Gaza Strip. According to the article, the staff member is alive and resides in Egypt. The article was published on October 18, 2024. <image:18>

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Yahya_Sinwar): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the killing of Yahya Sinwar, a Hamas leader, by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on October 16, 2024, during the Gaza war. <image:18> The article mentions that UNRWA teacher's passport was found on Sinwar's body. The article also includes images of Sinwar.

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The black band on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the provided image, was present before the death of Yahya Sinwar and is used to show solidarity with war victims, not to mourn Sinwar.

So, the overall veracity is: false
