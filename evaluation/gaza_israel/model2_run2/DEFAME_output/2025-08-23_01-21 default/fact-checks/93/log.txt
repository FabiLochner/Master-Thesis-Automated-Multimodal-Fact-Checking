Content: The Times of Israel published an article discussing travel chaos at Ben Gurion Airport. The article includes an image of a crowded airport. <image:5803>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/the-airlines-impacted-by-the-global-tech-outage): 
Content: The CNN article includes an image of a crowded airport. <image:5804>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image depicts a crowded airport, and there were reports of a Houthi attack and increased passenger volume at Ben Gurion Airport in July 2024, there is no evidence to confirm that the image specifically shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
