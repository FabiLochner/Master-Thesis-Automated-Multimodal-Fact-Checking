### Evidence from `web_search`
CUFI.org discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar, who ordered the elimination of Hezbollah’s UAV unit.

Press TV reported on November 27, 2024, that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Multiple sources confirm that Major General Tomer Bar is alive. An AOL fact-check and Inshorts both state that there is no evidence to support the claim of his death.

Press TV reported that Hezbollah claimed to have targeted Tomer Bar's residence in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024. However, this does not confirm the claim that he was killed.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including fact-checks from AOL and Inshorts, state that there is no evidence to support the claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed. While Press TV reported a Hezbollah claim of targeting his residence, this does not confirm his death.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed in a drone attack is false. Fact-checks from sources like AOL and Inshorts state there is no evidence to support the claim, and Tomer Bar is alive. While Press TV reported a Hezbollah claim of targeting his residence, this does not confirm his death.
