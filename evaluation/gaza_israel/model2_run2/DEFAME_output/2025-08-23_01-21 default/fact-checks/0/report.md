## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 1](media/0.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg): Found exact image on website with title: File:Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg
Content: The image is from Wikimedia Commons and is titled "Two 19th Group Special Forces Soldiers in Babil Province Iraq.jpg". The image shows two soldiers in Babil Province Iraq in 2007. The image was uploaded on June 21, 2011, and the author is the United States Army. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image is of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, according to the Wikimedia Commons entry. The claim states that the image shows General John Pagri, who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.

The evidence contradicts the claim. The image is not of General John Pagri, and it was taken in Iraq in 2007, not in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.


## Final Judgement
The image is of two soldiers in Iraq in 2007, not General John Pagri who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025. The claim is therefore false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is of two soldiers in Babil Province, Iraq, in 2007, as evidenced by the [Wikimedia Commons entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg). This contradicts the claim that the image depicts General John Pagri who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.
