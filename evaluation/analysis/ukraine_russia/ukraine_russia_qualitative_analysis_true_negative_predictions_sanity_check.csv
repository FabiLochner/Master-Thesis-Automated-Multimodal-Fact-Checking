The evidence from the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-61612803)) and other sources confirms the correct date and location. Additionally, the claim that Ukrainian troops occupied the Kursk region is not supported by the provided evidence.
","A reverse image search and subsequent keyword searches on Google found the same photo -- distributed by the Ukrainian presidential office -- published in AFP's archives on May 29, 2022. 
The caption of the photo said it was taken in Kharkiv, Ukraine and showed Zelensky visiting the houses and other structures destroyed by the clashes in the city and held a meeting with army officials.",False,False

Multiple sources, including a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/67411857), indicate that the total amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine by February 2025 was significantly less than $350 billion. The BBC article states that the US had spent $130.6 billion between January 24, 2022, and June 30, 2025.
","It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.
Trump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false.",False,False
