The CIA’s World Factbook says its population data is from the U.S. Census Bureau. A Census Bureau spokesperson told PolitiFact that if the World Factbook used census data for population growth rates, the data would come from the international population estimates and projections released in August 2023, before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.
