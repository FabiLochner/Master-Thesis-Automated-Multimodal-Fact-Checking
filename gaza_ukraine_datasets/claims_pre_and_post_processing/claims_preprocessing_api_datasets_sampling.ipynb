The image caption reads, \"The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian).\" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa. The people around him match those in the viral photo.\\n                                          The Islamic Republic News Agency also published the original image in a news report dated February 11, 2024.\\n                                          The image was captioned, \"Sardar Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, attended the march on 22 Bahman. (translated by Persian).\" The report adds that Iranians participated in the march on 22 Bahman, held in Tehran and other cities on February 11, 2024. (22 Bahman refers to the 22 days of the Bahman month (Eleventh month), according to the Persian calendar, which refers to February 11 in the Georgian calendar.) The annual march commemorates Iran\\'s Islamic revolution in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established.\\n',\n",

These reports can be seen here, here and here.\\n                                        In these reports, the picture was attributed to the Associated Press. Scanning the official website of the Associated Press, we found the original picture taken during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on July 26, 2024.\\n                                        The caption reads: “Israel’s Andrea Murez and Peter Paltchik carry their country’s flag in Paris, France, during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics on July 26, 2024.”\\n                                        In the comparison above, it is confirmed that the banner originally reading ‘Israel’ has been digitally manipulated and changed to ‘Team Genocide’ by using the photo-editing software.\\n                                        Thus, it is confirmed that the image of the Israeli team during the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony has been photoshopped.

The video of the incident can also be found on the YouTube channel of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF).\\n                                        Thus, it is clear that the viral photo has no connection to the ongoing Paris Olympics. It's worth noting that karate debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics but was not included in the Paris Games due to concerns about its entertainment value and youth appeal.   \n",

The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility.

He confirmed that Sham lost her right arm and died the following day due to the severity of her injuries. Nahed also posted footage of baby Sham on his Instagram account two days ago, providing details about the Israeli airstrike that targeted her family.   \n",

On searching further, we found a report by BanglaNews on January 16, 2024, saying that the deputy director of the hospital, M. Zakiur Rahman, clarified that the picture had been in circulation for years. Another report by Protidiner Sangbad says netizens claimed that the picture was taken near Mymensingh Medical College (MMEC) Hospital as some of the images showed a tin fence which resembled the construction work that was underway in January near the hospital. Similar reports was also published by another local media outlet stating that the image was circulating online with a claim that it was taken near the MMEC Hospital area.    \n",

After selecting the text, using the translation option in Google reverse image search, Google Translate showed that the Arabic phrase means, “Aerial shots of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside,” not Gaza as claimed. The video ends with the logo of the Syria TV channel, casting further doubt on the claim's validity. Upon searching for the keywords “Zamalka” and “Syria TV” in Arabic, Misbar’s team found the same video published on the Syria TV YouTube channel on Dec. 16, 2024, titled: “Aerial footage of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside shows the massive destruction of its buildings.” The video showed several aerial shots of the Syrian city Zamalka, 10 kilometers away from the capital Damascus, where the city is completely destroyed and deserted.   \n",
       "6   Iran is preparing to strike Israeli target from Iraqi territory, according to the Jerusalem Post. The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.    \n",

    "        \"Context/Label_Explanation\": \"\"\" For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn't explicit, Newsweek has treated the term \"lost\" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was \"interested primarily from the standpoint of death,\" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed.\n",
    "                                        A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia's killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000.\n",
    "                                        In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament's House of Commons: \"Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months.\"\n",
    "                                        Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were \"recoverable.\"\n",
    "                                        Recent estimates published by Ukraine's military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn't far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS's estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a \"minimum\" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550.\"\"\",\n",

       "  'Context/Label_Explanation': ' For the benefit of the doubt, and as it wasn\\'t explicit, Newsweek has treated the term \"lost\" to mean losses from those killed or injured. Trump said last month that 1.7 million soldiers across both sides had been killed, as reported by Politico, for which there is no evidence. Even though he went on to say that he was \"interested primarily from the standpoint of death,\" Newsweek assessed the total of wounded and killed.\\n                                        A November 2024 report by the French Institute of International Relations referenced British military intelligence that said that as of May 2024, Russia\\'s killed and wounded was up to 500,000. Using data from other conflicts to estimate the amount of Russian irreversible losses (those killed, wounded who died in hospital, or otherwise immobilized), the report suggested total irreversible Russian casualties in Ukraine by mid-summer 2024 had reached around 460,000.\\n                                        In December 2024, the U.K. Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard MP, told the U.K. Parliament\\'s House of Commons: \"Our assessments further indicate there have been over 750,000 Russian casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion with the grim milestone of one million Russians dead and wounded likely to be reached within approximately six months.\"\\n                                        Global security experts at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in a report published this week that, as of early January 2025, it estimated a minimum of 172,000 Russian troops had been killed, with 611,000 wounded, of whom 376,000 were severely wounded. Recruitment since the start of the war had generated approximately 976,000 personnel, it said, adding that up to an accumulated 235,000 Russian wounded were \"recoverable.\"\\n                                        Recent estimates published by Ukraine\\'s military say that as of February 10, 2025, Russian casualties had reached 850,490. While larger, its total isn\\'t far from independent experts and government reports, with recent Ukrainian analyses echoing experts outside Kyiv. For example, the IISS\\'s estimate of 783,000 from early January 2025 was, by its own words, a \"minimum\" approximate and, as noted by defense-industry specialist magazine Defense Express, was roughly in line with the Ukrainian military estimate published in late December 2024 of 789,550.',\n",
