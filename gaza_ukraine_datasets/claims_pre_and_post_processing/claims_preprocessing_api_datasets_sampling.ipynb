The image caption reads, \"The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian).\" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa. The people around him match those in the viral photo.\\n                                          The Islamic Republic News Agency also published the original image in a news report dated February 11, 2024.\\n                                          The image was captioned, \"Sardar Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, attended the march on 22 Bahman. (translated by Persian).\" The report adds that Iranians participated in the march on 22 Bahman, held in Tehran and other cities on February 11, 2024. (22 Bahman refers to the 22 days of the Bahman month (Eleventh month), according to the Persian calendar, which refers to February 11 in the Georgian calendar.) The annual march commemorates Iran\\'s Islamic revolution in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established.\\n',\n",

These reports can be seen here, here and here.\\n                                        In these reports, the picture was attributed to the Associated Press. Scanning the official website of the Associated Press, we found the original picture taken during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on July 26, 2024.\\n                                        The caption reads: “Israel’s Andrea Murez and Peter Paltchik carry their country’s flag in Paris, France, during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics on July 26, 2024.”\\n                                        In the comparison above, it is confirmed that the banner originally reading ‘Israel’ has been digitally manipulated and changed to ‘Team Genocide’ by using the photo-editing software.\\n                                        Thus, it is confirmed that the image of the Israeli team during the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony has been photoshopped.

Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present, and no injuries were reported.\\n                                        Further, we found another report by the Times of Israel titled: ‘Israel vows Iran will ‘pay’ for Hezbollah attack on Netanyahu home; Tehran distances itself’, dated October 20, 2024.

According to these reports, Egypt’s U-15 youth team showed solidarity with Palestine by holding the country's flag after taking first and second place at the World ITKF Traditional Karate Championship in Slovenia. The Israeli competitor finished third in the tournament.\\n                                        Additionally, \"Egypt Independent\" also carried the viral photo with the same information. The video of the incident can also be found on the YouTube channel of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF).\\n                                        Thus, it is clear that the viral photo has no connection to the ongoing Paris Olympics. It's worth noting that karate debuted at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics but was not included in the Paris Games due to concerns about its entertainment value and youth appeal.   \n",

The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility.

He confirmed that Sham lost her right arm and died the following day due to the severity of her injuries. Nahed also posted footage of baby Sham on his Instagram account two days ago, providing details about the Israeli airstrike that targeted her family.   \n",

On searching further, we found a report by BanglaNews on January 16, 2024, saying that the deputy director of the hospital, M. Zakiur Rahman, clarified that the picture had been in circulation for years. Another report by Protidiner Sangbad says netizens claimed that the picture was taken near Mymensingh Medical College (MMEC) Hospital as some of the images showed a tin fence which resembled the construction work that was underway in January near the hospital. Similar reports was also published by another local media outlet stating that the image was circulating online with a claim that it was taken near the MMEC Hospital area.    \n",

After selecting the text, using the translation option in Google reverse image search, Google Translate showed that the Arabic phrase means, “Aerial shots of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside,” not Gaza as claimed. The video ends with the logo of the Syria TV channel, casting further doubt on the claim's validity. Upon searching for the keywords “Zamalka” and “Syria TV” in Arabic, Misbar’s team found the same video published on the Syria TV YouTube channel on Dec. 16, 2024, titled: “Aerial footage of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside shows the massive destruction of its buildings.” The video showed several aerial shots of the Syrian city Zamalka, 10 kilometers away from the capital Damascus, where the city is completely destroyed and deserted.   \n",
       "6   Iran is preparing to strike Israeli target from Iraqi territory, according to the Jerusalem Post. The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.    \n",
