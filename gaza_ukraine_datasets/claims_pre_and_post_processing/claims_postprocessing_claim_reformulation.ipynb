    "The idea of this script is to re-formulate the claims into a coherent format (depending on the claim type (text, image, AI-image, altered image)) and add necessary context information to the claim that has not been covered when the original claim was shared on social media, e.g., a date or place of an event. The reformulation will either be done by prompting a LLM or manually. The decision depends on which of the two approaches is more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) I will start with the reformulation of claims with AI-generated and altered images, because these claims need a re-formulation due to the re-labeling in the label aggregation (see the \"claims_postprocessing_label_aggregation.ipynb\" script). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) I will proceed with the reformulation of claims with normal images. Some of these claims explicitly refer to an image in their claim, while most do not. All of the claims should be re-formulated in a standardized format which explicilty mentions the image. For the formatting, I will look into the claim formulation of the VERITE dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Lastly, I will proceed with the reformulation of text-only claims. This is done lastly, because some of these claims might not need a re-formulation. The idea here is as well to have a coherent format, that all claims cover the same key information that is necessary for verification, e.g., time, place, context of an event. "

       "      <td>NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI.</td>\n",

Watermarks that say \"in.visualart\" on the upper left side and \"designed by in.visualart\" on the lower left part have been cropped out in the circulating posts. The primary Instagram account sharing the image -- called \"in.visualart\" -- describes itself as a \"designer\" and labels its content as \"AI tools\" and \"AI-generated image\". Shu Hu, head of Purdue University's Machine Learning and Media Forensics Lab in the United States, told AFP the image was AI-generated (archived link). Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was \"no obvious segmentation\", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery. While there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media, identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI.   \n",

The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as \"likely\" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is \"not authentic.\" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic. He, too, noted differences in the shape of the prime minister's ear compared to the one seen in the posts.   \n",

Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a \"bull tattoo.\" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content.    \n",
       "99   NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI.   \n",

They were correct. The image was a cropped and manipulated version of a real photo of Thunberg holding a sign reading, \"Stand With Gaza.\" We have labeled the in-question image fake. We reached out to the author of the X post above to ask if they digitally created the image — or, if not, if they could share where they found it. We will update this report if we receive a response.

The newspaper also said in an X post that it is a fabrication. The screenshotted image in the post is an edited version of the headline of a Dec. 12 opinion piece that reads, “What the Glorification of Luigi Mangione Reveals About America.” Its subhead, which describes “a new era of rage” in the U.S., matches the one in the Threads post.   \n",

Our search for recent reports regarding Gibson’s alleged statement yielded no relevant results. In 2006, Gibson apologized for antisemitic remarks made during his arrest for drunk driving in Los Angeles. Aside from that incident, there have been no recent statements from him concerning Israel amid the ongoing conflict involving Hamas and Iran. We have contacted Gibson’s publicist for a comment and will update the story upon receiving a response. It is noteworthy that this same screenshot went viral in 2023 and was debunked by Reuters and AP News. At that time, Gibson’s representative, Alan Nierob, confirmed, “It is a fake post, as Mr. Gibson does not have any social media platforms.”   \n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral circulation of the image, the screenshot was photoshopped, altering the original captioning of the poll behind the Israeli channel’s presenter. The poll, originally conducted by Channel 12 in May 2022, asked whether respondents agreed with the claim that the government's support leans on terror supporters. The original video showing Channel 12's presenter announcing the poll results was uploaded to YouTube on May 28, 2022. The translated caption of the Hebrew question from the Channel 12 poll reads, \"Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?\" Despite this, the image has been misrepresented on social media, with a false caption suggesting the poll asked if Israeli soldiers should be allowed to rape a prisoner.   \n",
       "88   We found the original image shared by Tasnim News (archived here) on February 11, 2024, through a reverse image search. The image caption reads, \"The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian).\" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa. The people around him match those in the viral photo. The Islamic Republic News Agency also published the original image in a news report dated February 11, 2024. The image was captioned, \"Sardar Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, attended the march on 22 Bahman. (translated by Persian).\" The report adds that Iranians participated in the march on 22 Bahman, held in Tehran and other cities on February 11, 2024. (22 Bahman refers to the 22 days of the Bahman month (Eleventh month), according to the Persian calendar, which refers to February 11 in the Georgian calendar.) The annual march commemorates Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established.   \n",

The spread was dedicated to the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, which were delayed by a year due to China’s zero-COVID policy and held in September 2023 instead. The color scheme in the fashion image shared in the posts is similar to the Palestinian flag, which incorporates the colors red, green, black and white. But it does not match China’s official Olympic team colors.</td>\n",

The caption says the picture was taken at the Wingate Institute, Israel's national sports training center outside Tel Aviv, and that it features 10 artistic swimmers. Among the athletes are Shelly Bobritsky and Ariel Nassee, who qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics as part of the duet category (archived here and here). Israeli news outlets including the Arabic-language service of i24News reported on the team's photo in November 2023 (archived here and here). Israeli drone photographer Adam Spiegel posted the picture on Instagram the same day as the Israeli Artistic Swimming Team (archived here). Spiegel confirmed in a July 30 email that he took the original image, compiling several aerial shots of the swimmers into a composite collage. He said he was \"disappointed\" that social media users used his photo without credit and \"invented a fake news story.\"   \n",

The image was shared online after Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran early on Wednesday, hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Iran’s new president. Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of launching the strike that killed Haniyeh. The photo was published online two years before the killing of Haniyeh, however. One of the earliest iterations was posted, on X on July 31, 2 022, by Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary alongside another image that shows the same building with a person’s h and pointing at it. Reuters has not independently verified the original source or location of the image. However, it was described by CNN, as showing the house where al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2022.   \n",

The image dates back to 2000 and depicts a woman using an Israeli tank that was left over in Lebanon after the IOF pulled back to the international border line, ending a 22-year occupation of south Lebanon. The image was published in a report on the website of the war-zone correspondent and political analyst of the events in the Middle East and North Africa Elijah J. Magnier, titled \"20 Years After the Unconditional Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Where Are We? The report attributed the attached photo to Younes Zaatari, with a description indicating that it was taken in southern Lebanon in 2000. The photo was published on X, via a similar name “Younes Al-Zaatari” with a description that reads “A photo taken by my father took of a woman mocking the Israeli arrogance in Southern Lebanon. I remember this photo and the taste of the Lebanese meat pie that was served by the old woman.”</td>\n",

Misbar’s investigation found that the photos, falsely claimed to show protests in India, capture pro-Palestine demonstrations in Bangladesh amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza. Misbar's team conducted a detailed reverse image search and traced the photos to Somoy TV, a Dhaka-based news outlet. Somoy TV originally uploaded the images on Facebook, stating they show protests held at Suhrawardy Udyan in support of Palestine. The post’s translated caption reads, “March for Gaza. Lakhs of people are gathering in processions at Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire area is filled with slogans.” Misbar’s team verified the location mentioned by several media outlets, Suhrawardy Udyan, and found that the park is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not India. By comparing the videos and photos shared of the pro-Palestine protests, Misbar's team found that they all feature the exact location in Bangladesh. Moreover, Misbar’s team searched for reports of recent pro-Palestine protests in India but found no evidence confirming that such demonstrations have occurred there recently.</td>\n",

The user stated that he took the picture at the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia, on May 17, 2007.

The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.    \n",

The photo was published on X, via a similar name “Younes Al-Zaatari” with a description that reads “A photo taken by my father took of a woman mocking the Israeli arrogance in Southern Lebanon. I remember this photo and the taste of the Lebanese meat pie that was served by the old woman.”   \n",
       "62   Photos Show Recent Pro-Palestine Protests in Bangladesh. Misbar’s investigation found that the photos, falsely claimed to show protests in India, capture pro-Palestine demonstrations in Bangladesh amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza. Misbar's team conducted a detailed reverse image search and traced the photos to Somoy TV, a Dhaka-based news outlet. Somoy TV originally uploaded the images on Facebook, stating they show protests held at Suhrawardy Udyan in support of Palestine. The post’s translated caption reads, “March for Gaza. Lakhs of people are gathering in processions at Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire area is filled with slogans.” Misbar’s team verified the location mentioned by several media outlets, Suhrawardy Udyan, and found that the park is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not India. By comparing the videos and photos shared of the pro-Palestine protests, Misbar's team found that they all feature the exact location in Bangladesh. Moreover, Misbar’s team searched for reports of recent pro-Palestine protests in India but found no evidence confirming that such demonstrations have occurred there recently.   \n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the photo is unrelated to the ongoing Israeli genocidal campaign in Gaza. Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough reverse image search and traced the photo back to 2006. A Flickr user originally uploaded it, stating that the image shows two mummified Spanish children from the 1800s. The user noted that she took the photo on December 22, 2006, at the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia. The original caption reads, “It's always a surprise what you find in museums. In the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia, I found two mummified Spanish children from the 1800s. Gruesome stuff.” Another Flickr user also uploaded a photo of the same mummified children, confirming the same details. The user stated that he took the picture at the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia, on May 17, 2007. In addition, a tourism website published the same photo of the mummified children alongside other photos from the Mint Museum in Potosí, Bolivia.   \n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the photo is unrelated to the recent Israeli airstrike on the Gaza Strip. A thorough reverse image search traced the image back to June 2024, capturing an Israeli airstrike on a residential neighborhood in Nabatieh, South Lebanon. The Cradle news outlet posted the photo on X on June 26, 2024, with the caption: “BREAKING | Israel bombs a residential neighborhood in the city of Nabatieh in South Lebanon, destroying an entire building. In addition, the daily newspaper L'Orient Today used the same photo in a published article on June 27, 2024, reporting on the Israeli bombing of a residential neighborhood in Nabatieh.”   \n",

The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. The same image was used in a report on the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The photo, dated July 6, 2024, with the description “Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024,” was credited to Mario Coto, a U.S. Navy employee.

A news report by The Times of Israel published on January 30, 2024, headlined, \"State approves repairs to pool in Netanyahu's Caesarea home – report,\" carried the same photo of the property. The image captioned, \"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea,\" was credited to Israeli public broadcaster KAN. The Times of Israel also used the photo for another article on Netanyahu's house published on July 19, 2024. Another report by Radio J, a French radio station that broadcasts information from the Jewish community, carried the same image in an article published on January 30, 2024, crediting the photo to KAN. Further, upon relevant Google searches in Hebrew, we found a video uploaded by KAN (archived here) on its YouTube channel on July 1, 2019, with the same visuals at the 0:07 timestamp. The video was originally titled in Hebrew and, when translated using Google, reads, \"The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.\"    \n",
       "86   A reverse image search led us to a report dated June 24, 2024, published on the official website of the U.S. Navy, titled \"BALTOPS 24 Concludes In Kiel, Germany.” The report also included the now-viral image. The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. The same image was used in a report on the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The photo, dated July 6, 2024, with the description “Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024,” was credited to Mario Coto, a U.S. Navy employee.

On March 10, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social announcing that ICE had arrested and detained Khalil, whom he called a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student.\" Trump's post said Khalil's arrest was the \"first of many to come\" and that he expected \"every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply\" with ICE's actions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an X post the day after Khalid was arrested that the department would revoke visas and green cards for \"Hamas supporters,\" and a separate X post from the official Department of Homeland Security account claimed that \"Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\" On March 9, Khalil's lawyers filed a petition alleging that his detainment was illegal on the grounds that lawful permanent residents are protected by the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fifth Amendment right to due process.   \n",
       "42  Trump did indeed say the above words, speaking at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on Jan. 7, 2025. As such, we rate this claim a correct attribution. Trump made the comment in response to a journalist asking about the state of negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He was joined by Steve Witkoff, his pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, who said negotiators were \"making a lot of progress\" and \"hopefully it will all work out and we'll save some lives.\" Witkoff also credited Trump's \"stature\" as driving the negotiation. A journalist then asked Trump and Witkoff to clarify past remarks about how \"all hell must be paid\" if Hamas did not release the hostages, to which Trump said, while briefly addressing Witkoff: 'I don't want to hurt your negotiations, [but] if [the hostages] are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East. And it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone. All hell will break out. I don't have to say anymore, but that's what it is.'   \n",

The unfounded claim originated from a social media account that was satirical in nature. However, a number of posts reshared the claim, assuming it to be real, and calling for a boycott of U2 and Geldof. One post stated, \"Boycott Zionist rock stars like Bob Geldof, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Radiohead, and U2. They're all shite these days, anyway.\" The claim first appeared on Nov. 4, 2024, on an X account titled, \"The Real Irish Times.\" The account bio states: \"Political Satire & Parody. Exposing the hypocrisy of the Irish media and those in positions of power & influence.\"   \n",

Woodruff also corrected herself in the aftermath, and said her comments were a \"mistake.\" There was also no independent verification about the topics discussed on the purported phone call, as reported by Axios, who added an editor's note to their article, which read: \"This story has been updated to reflect that Netanyahu's office denied a phone call took place on Wednesday between the Israeli prime minister and former President Trump.” Though Trump and Netanyahu denied the claim, and Woodruff issued a correction, Axios still cited two unnamed sources who said the call took place. Given Snopes was unable to track down these unknown sources to verify the claim, we have rated this claim \"Unproven.”   \n",

       "      <td>President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a missile defense plan to defend the United States from ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles and other aerial threats, according to DefenseScoop. NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet.</td>\n",

Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, Misbar’s team found no evidence supporting the viral claim that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened Israel or urged the United States to control its ally over its intervention in southern Syria. Misbar’s investigative team reviewed Erdogan’s official X account and found no such statement. In addition, Misbar’s team searched the Turkish presidency’s Directorate of Communications but found no official statements mentioning the U.S. or Israel in connection with the recent incursion into southern Syria.   \n",
       "70   President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a missile defense plan to defend the United States from ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles and other aerial threats, according to DefenseScoop. NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet.    \n",

       "      <td>NewsMeter found that the claim is false. A keyword search led us to a report by BBC titled, ‘Netanyahu says he is undeterred after reported drone attack on his home’, dated October 20, 2024. According to the report, a drone was used to target the Israeli PM’s private residence in the coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning. Neither Netanyahu nor his wife were present, and no injuries were reported. Further, we found another report by the Times of Israel titled: ‘Israel vows Iran will ‘pay’ for Hezbollah attack on Netanyahu home; Tehran distances itself’, dated October 20, 2024. No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false.</td>\n",

The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.</td>\n",

No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false.   \n",

USGS data shows that no earthquake occurred in Israel on or shortly before October 5th. No credible sources have reported that an earthquake occurred near Tel Aviv around October 5th. The EMSC made a post on X that verifies there is no data that indicates an earthquake occurred in Israel around October 5th. The caption reads, “#Israel 19 min ago⚠ We have no data confirming this crowdsourced detection. 👉 It likely was a false detection. No more info will be displayed in the thread. ” When asked for comment, EMSC told Check Your Fact, “we stress the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of this detection. The second message in the thread confirms that this detection has not been confirmed.” Check Your Fact has also reached out to USGS for comment. Due to the tension between Israel and Iran, many social media users have attributed the false detection to an alleged Iranian nuclear test. No reputable sources have reported that Iran conducted a nuclear test on or close to October 5th.    \n",

Misbar’s team searched the viral claim and did not find any credible news media reporting on it. On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.    \n",

Contrary to social media users’ spreading conspiracy theory regarding the assassination of Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh, Meta’s WhatsApp has not been working in Iran since 2022. As protests spread over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran, access to Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked in September 2022. According to data from NetBlocks, authorities have responded with a series of internet restrictions, targeting all users registered with an Iranian (+98) phone number across all major network operators.    \n",

The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft.   \n",

Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was \"no obvious segmentation\", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery.

While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show \"American Ninja Warrior\" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here).

Watermarks that say \"in.visualart\" on the upper left side and \"designed by in.visualart\" on the lower left part have been cropped out in the circulating posts. The primary Instagram account sharing the image -- called \"in.visualart\" -- describes itself as a \"designer\" and labels its content as \"AI tools\" and \"AI-generated image\". Shu Hu, head of Purdue University's Machine Learning and Media Forensics Lab in the United States, told AFP the image was AI-generated (archived link). Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was \"no obvious segmentation\", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery. While there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media, identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI.   \n",

       "78   Poland Celebrates Historic Red Army Defeat On August 15, the same footage appeared on DW with the comment: “With tensions rising at its eastern borders, Poland put on a big show with a military parade to celebrate Armed Forces Day. Those tensions are also the reason why the country is aiming to build one of Europe's largest military forces.” Contrary to claims on social media, Poland paid tribute to its historic 1920 triumph over the Red Army on Thursday, August 15, by remembering fallen Poles and showcasing new military equipment. On Armed Forces Day, around 2,500 Polish soldiers, along with dozens of U.S. and other allied forces, marched in military vehicles or tanks, or flew in fighter jets and helicopters in Warsaw, Poland's capital.   \n",

The photo, published on June 14, 2023, depicts Leopard 2 tanks and several Ukrainian armored vehicles reportedly destroyed by Russia in Zaporizhia. The photo was credited to Reuters. The website reported that Ukraine's \"iron fist\" 47th Brigade had suffered heavy losses at the hands of Russian forces.

While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion.

That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false.</td>\n",

       "23  It's possible to arrive at varying totals depending on how military aid is defined or by considering how much money was allocated — as opposed to actually paid out — by the U.S. government, but none of these totals amounts to $350 billion.\\nTrump's claim is incorrect. While it is possible to arrive at varying totals using different ways to categorize or count the financial figures, none amounts to $350 billion. As of this writing, the United States had allocated nearly $183 billion for the response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, according to the U.S. government's inspector general overseeing the situation. That amount includes more than just what the U.S. government directly sent to Ukraine — and only $83 billion had actually been paid out as of December 2024. Thus, we rate this claim false.    \n",
