The director of the urology department at Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Center, Ofer Gofrit, publicly stated that Netanyahu’s surgery on December 29, 2024, went well and that there was “no suspicion” of malignancy or cancer. This directly contradicts the claim of a cancer diagnosis. What was Netanyahu’s actual medical condition? Netanyahu’s medical condition was related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. This condition is common in older men and can cause urinary issues but does not involve cancer. Netanyahu underwent surgery to remove his prostate as a result of this benign enlargement. His office confirmed this diagnosis, further debunking the cancer claim. Why would a cancer diagnosis be publicly known? If Netanyahu had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, particularly a high-grade cancer like grade 3, it would have been widely reported in the media. Health updates concerning high-profile figures like Netanyahu are typically publicised, especially when it involves a serious condition like cancer. However, no credible news outlets or official statements have reported that Netanyahu has been diagnosed with cancer. What did Netanyahu’s office and medical team say? Netanyahu’s office issued a statement confirming that he was treated for a urinary tract infection caused by benign prostate enlargement. Additionally, Netanyahu’s medical team confirmed that the surgery was related to BPH, not cancer. ",True,False,False,False
