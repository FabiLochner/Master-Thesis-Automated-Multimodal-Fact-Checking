Netanyahu’s medical condition was related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. This condition is common in older men and can cause urinary issues but does not involve cancer. Netanyahu underwent surgery to remove his prostate as a result of this benign enlargement.

On digging further, we found the same image used in several reports about the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. These reports can be seen here, here and here. In these reports, the picture was attributed to the Associated Press. Scanning the official website of the Associated Press, we found the original picture taken during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on July 26, 2024. The caption reads: “Israel’s Andrea Murez and Peter Paltchik carry their country’s flag in Paris, France, during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics on July 26, 2024.” In the comparison above, it is confirmed that the banner originally reading ‘Israel’ has been digitally manipulated and changed to ‘Team Genocide’ by using the photo-editing software. Thus, it is confirmed that the image of the Israeli team during the 2024 Paris Olympics opening ceremony has been photoshopped. ",False,False,False,True,api

The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers.
