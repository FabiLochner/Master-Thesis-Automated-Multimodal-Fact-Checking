This is confirmed by photographic and video evidence showing the engine and other parts of the drone found at the impact site, which are specific to a Russian UAV. Representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) present at the site also confirmed the attack on the sarcophagus. In addition, independent open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts confirmed that the drone entered Ukrainian airspace from the north or north-east, coming from Russian or Belarusian territory. Since the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia has consistently used attacks on Ukrainian nuclear energy facilities as a weapon and tool of blackmail to achieve its geopolitical objectives.",
