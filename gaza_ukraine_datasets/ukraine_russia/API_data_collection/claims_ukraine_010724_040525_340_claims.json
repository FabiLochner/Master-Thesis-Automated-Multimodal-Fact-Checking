The message was posted on a Facebook account that, according to available data, previously belonged to Ukrainian soldier Artur Yakovitskyi. His family has reported him missing - according to open sources, he disappeared near the settlement of Sudzha on 28 February 2025. On 28 March, a suspicious post appeared on his Facebook page, allegedly containing a confession to the murder. On 1 April, a screenshot of this post began actively circulating on pro-Russian Telegram channels. The image of the \"murdered teenager\" attached to the post was likely generated by artificial intelligence - this is supported by the analysis results of several AI detection tools.",

Representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) present at the site also confirmed the attack on the sarcophagus. In addition, independent open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysts confirmed that the drone entered Ukrainian airspace from the north or north-east, coming from Russian or Belarusian territory. Since the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine, Russia has consistently used attacks on Ukrainian nuclear energy facilities as a weapon and tool of blackmail to achieve its geopolitical objectives.",
