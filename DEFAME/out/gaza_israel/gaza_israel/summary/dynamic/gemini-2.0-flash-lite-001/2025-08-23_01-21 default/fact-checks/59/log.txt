Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_North_Gaza): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Siege of North Gaza" discusses the 2024 engagement in the Gaza Strip, including the siege of Jabalia, which began on October 5, 2024. The article mentions that on October 10, Hamas organized an ambush which destroyed an IDF mechanized infantry company of 12 vehicles east of the Jabalia camp. The article also mentions that on October 22, Hamas said that its fighters detonated an explosive device targeting 12 Israeli soldiers in the Jabalia refugee camp. The article also mentions that on 17 November, Israeli media reported that that IDF soldiers preparing an ambush in southern Jabalia were themselves ambushed by Hamas fighters. The article also mentions that on 20 December, a Hamas fighter carried out a suicide bombing against an IDF position in the Jabalia camp. The article also mentions that on 30 December, Palestinian militants carried out a "relatively large attack" in multiple waves against IDF positions around the Jabalia camp. The article also includes an image of a Merkava tank destroyed by Hamas in Beit Hanoun. <image:34>
