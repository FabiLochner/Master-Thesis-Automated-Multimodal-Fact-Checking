## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 48](media/79.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 48](media/79.jpg)

## Elaboration
The provided image appears to be a digital artwork or a simulation, not a real photograph. The reverse image search did not yield any results that confirm the claim.

The image shows a large aircraft on fire at an airbase, surrounded by military vehicles. The presence of the "Guerras Geopolíticas" logo suggests the image may be related to geopolitical events. However, without further evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim.

The claim is not supported by the available evidence. More information is needed to verify the authenticity of the image and the events it depicts.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)) reported that Hezbollah claimed to have launched rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024, and includes images of damage in Kiryat Bialik ![image 49](media/80.jpg). Politico.eu ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)) also reported on the attack on the same date.

The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)) discussed Hezbollah's rocket attacks on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, and included a photo of the airbase ![image 1](media/0.jpg).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase. One source, from defapress.ir, includes an image of missiles being launched ([https://defapress.ir/en/news/85030/hezbollah-targeted-ramat-david-airbase-with-several-missiles](https://defapress.ir/en/news/85030/hezbollah-targeted-ramat-david-airbase-with-several-missiles)) ![image 5620](media/2025-08-23_01-47-1755913657-049408.jpg). The Palestine Chronicle published an image of a fire ([https://www.palestinechronicle.com/gaza-live-blog-beirut-death-toll-rises-strike-in-zaytoun-israels-aggression-on-lebanon-continues-day-351/](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/gaza-live-blog-beirut-death-toll-rises-strike-in-zaytoun-israels-aggression-on-lebanon-continues-day-351/)) ![image 5621](media/2025-08-23_01-47-1755913657-305391.jpg). Pars Today also discusses the attack and includes an image of explosions at the airbase ([https://parstoday.ir/en/news/west_asia-i230538-huge_blasts_in_ramat_david_airbase_of_israel_five_important_points_about_hezbollah's_broad_attack](https://parstoday.ir/en/news/west_asia-i230538-huge_blasts_in_ramat_david_airbase_of_israel_five_important_points_about_hezbollah's_broad_attack)) ![image 5622](media/2025-08-23_01-47-1755913658-051277.jpg).


## Elaboration
The claim that the image depicts the Ramat David airbase attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, cannot be verified. While multiple sources confirm the attack on the airbase on the specified date, the provided image ![image 48](media/79.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image is an authentic depiction of the Ramat David airbase attack by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While the attack did occur on that date, the image appears to be a digital artwork or simulation. The reverse image search did not yield any results that confirm the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

While the attack on Ramat David airbase by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, is confirmed by multiple sources ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)), the image provided appears to be a digital artwork or simulation, and its authenticity cannot be verified.
