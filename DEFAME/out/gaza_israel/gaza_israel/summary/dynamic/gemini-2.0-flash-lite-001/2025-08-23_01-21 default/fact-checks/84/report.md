## Claim
Claim: "![image 53](media/84.jpg) This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. It was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and is attributed to the Kan public broadcaster. The image was also featured in a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019.

The Times of Israel website also has articles related to the Prime Minister's Residence, discussing events from 2023, 2024, and 2025. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" by Robert Lindsay.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken before August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, and it was taken before August 2024. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, as evidenced by its appearance in a June 2020 Times of Israel article and a July 2019 YouTube video. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is false, as the image predates this timeframe.
