## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from the Atlantic Council, published on March 18, 2025, discusses the US approach toward the Houthis, mentioning that Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 15, 2025, in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. The article also mentions that Russia has aided Houthi operations.

An ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that the Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The article mentions that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships. A Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis includes a timeline of events, including Houthi attacks on commercial vessels and military operations. It mentions Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led coalition, and a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire. The article also mentions a statement by Yahya Saree that they would target ships heading to Israeli ports in the Mediterranean Sea. On May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is false. The Atlantic Council article indicates that Trump ordered airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2025, and the ABC News article reports attacks by the Houthis in July 2025, which contradicts the claim of a final cessation of military operations. The Wikipedia article mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire, but also that the Houthis continued to target ships.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. The evidence includes reports of continued attacks and airstrikes, directly contradicting the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council and ABC News, along with a Wikipedia article, indicates that the Houthis continued military operations in international waters after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and U.S. airstrikes in response.
