This contradicts the claim that the image depicts General John Pagri who died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.
",True,"A reverse image search reveals the photograph was uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, a website that collects free-use images, with a description that says that it was taken in 2007 in Iraq's Babil province (archived here). Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here). Several US media outlets published images of Doman from his service in Iraq, which are similar to those used in the social media posts (archived here)."

While the existence of the earthquake is confirmed by multiple sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake)), the image itself could not be verified through reverse image search or image search results. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.
",True,"However, a reverse image search for the first photo in the post led to a TikTok video shared February 20 by a user based in Gaza. The clip shows the same destroyed building (archived link). A photo from the Turkish Anadolu news agency shows the same scene.

Watermarks that say ""in.visualart"" on the upper left side and ""designed by in.visualart"" on the lower left part have been cropped out in the circulating posts. The primary Instagram account sharing the image -- called ""in.visualart"" -- describes itself as a ""designer"" and labels its content as ""AI tools"" and ""AI-generated image"". Shu Hu, head of Purdue University's Machine Learning and Media Forensics Lab in the United States, told AFP the image was AI-generated (archived link). Hu pointed out the woman's blurry teeth in the image and said that there was ""no obvious segmentation"", one of the hallmarks of AI-generated imagery. While there is no foolproof method to spot AI-generated media, identifying watermarks and visual inconsistencies can help, as errors still occur despite the meteoric progress in generative AI."

6,<image:7> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.,False,False,"The claim is false. While Benjamin Netanyahu has been hospitalized for various health issues, including a hernia operation in April 2024 and prostate surgery in December 2024, there is no evidence to support the claim that he was hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024.

",True,"However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic. He, too, noted differences in the shape of the prime minister's ear compared to the one seen in the posts."
7,The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.,False,False,"The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council and ABC News, along with a Wikipedia article, indicates that the Houthis continued military operations in international waters after Trump's election, including attacks on ships and U.S. airstrikes in response.
",True,"The militant group has said it will not halt its military operations, which come in response to Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Huthi rebels have maintained their attacks in international waters since Trump won the 2024 US presidential election -- and the group's leader has confirmed the outcome will not change its military strategy."
8,"<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.",False,False,"The claim is likely true. While the reverse image search reveals the image has been used in different contexts, the web search confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, and the image search provides a map of the strike locations.
",True,"In reality, the image shows a different Israeli bombardment in Lebanon. Reverse image searches on Google found a corresponding image published by Lebanese photographer Nabil Ismail alongside ten other images on his Instagram post (archived link). On the night of October 6, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) issued warnings that specified their targets in Beirut’s southern suburb (archived link). Citing official Lebanese media, AFP reported that four Israeli strikes struck south Beirut on October 6, shortly after calls by Israel's army for residents to evacuate the Hezbollah stronghold which has been bombarded for several days (archived link).

While there were indeed airstrikes on that date, the image search did not yield any results that matched the image in the claim.
",True,"A reverse image search and subsequent keyword searches on Google found the falsely shared photos were taken by AFP photographer Atta Kenare and Vahid Ahmadi, a photographer for Iran's Tasnim news agency, on June 2, 2021.

However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.
",True,"The court had instead found Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory as unlawful and said it should come to an end ""as rapidly as possible"". The ICJ said Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territories was against international law, in a nonbinding advisory opinion issued on July 19 on the request of the UN General Assembly. In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem, at the time annexed by Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt."

While the image depicts a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there is no evidence to support that it is Gal Gadot's star or that the vandalism occurred recently. The evidence suggests that the image may be related to the vandalism of Donald Trump's star, which occurred in the past, as reported by [Times Now News](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/was-donald-trumps-hollywood-star-vandalized-recently-fact-checking-viral-claims-article-119361540).

The White House provided no evidence, and USAID did not allocate funds for condoms in the Middle East during the relevant fiscal years.
",True,Statements from the Trump administration saying it discovered a plan to send $50 million to fund condoms in Gaza have been denied by the humanitarian group named as the recipient and by a former U.S. official.

While Donald Trump did sign an executive order related to UNRWA funding, the date provided in the claim, January 20, 2025, is incorrect.

The video ends with the logo of the Syria TV channel, casting further doubt on the claim's validity. Upon searching for the keywords “Zamalka” and “Syria TV” in Arabic, Misbar’s team found the same video published on the Syria TV YouTube channel on Dec. 16, 2024, titled: “Aerial footage of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside shows the massive destruction of its buildings.” The video showed several aerial shots of the Syrian city Zamalka, 10 kilometers away from the capital Damascus, where the city is completely destroyed and deserted."

At the 0:56 timestamp, a frame similar to the viral image can be seen. Several news outlets, including BBC and Yahoo News, featured the viral image in reports on Zelenskyy’s September 2024 visit to the United States, where he toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and discussed his “victory plan” to pressure Russia into a diplomatic resolution. AP News also featured the image in a report on Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant. The outlet stated that his visit aimed to thank workers producing one of the most needed types of ammunition for Ukraine in its war with Russia.

The photo was originally published by Agence France-Presse (AFP) and taken by the photographer Said Khatib. According to AFP’s caption, the photo showed the explosion of an Israeli airstrike on Rafah, a city in southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli Occupation Forces stated that the airstrike was conducted in response to a rocket launch from the Strip. The photographer also shared the photo to his Facebook account in April 2021, along with another picture of the same airstrike captured at a different moment. Additionally, several reputable outlets featured the photo in reports on the airstrike or analyses on the situation between Hamas and Israel, such as Haaretz and Middle East Eye. Middle East Eye reported that Israel struck two “training sites” in southern Gaza, which came hours after a rocket was fired into southern Israel. The rocket attack on Israel struck open ground and caused no casualties or damage, according to an Israeli spokesperson. It bears noting that the photo was previously misrepresented as an airstrike on Syria. In October 2022, the Jewish Press, an American news outlet, shared the photo falsely claiming that it showed an Israeli rocket attack on Damascus."

NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet. "

Further, we found another report by the Times of Israel titled: ‘Israel vows Iran will ‘pay’ for Hezbollah attack on Netanyahu home; Tehran distances itself’, dated October 20, 2024. No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false."

While there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and images of tents on fire exist, the image provided in the claim could not be found in relation to the strikes.
",True," Israeli Airstrikes Spark Deadly Fire at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The circulating image depicts tents engulfed in flames at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on the night of October 14, following an Israeli airstrike that resulted in the deaths of four individuals and injuries to dozens more. The photo was taken by Palestinian journalist Ramadan Abd for Reuters. These scenes were reported by Arab and Western media and captured by journalists and activists in Gaza, who documented the charred bodies of the victims from the Israeli strike that targeted displaced individuals inside their tents. Eyewitnesses stated that medical teams evacuated several injured people while large portions of their clothing were ablaze. They noted that the fire burned for 45 minutes before civil defense teams successfully brought it under control. "

",True," Although the purported post's format resembles a Facebook layout, Logically Facts did not locate any active official accounts for Mel Gibson on Facebook, X, or Instagram. Our search for recent reports regarding Gibson’s alleged statement yielded no relevant results. In 2006, Gibson apologized for antisemitic remarks made during his arrest for drunk driving in Los Angeles. Aside from that incident, there have been no recent statements from him concerning Israel amid the ongoing conflict involving Hamas and Iran. We have contacted Gibson’s publicist for a comment and will update the story upon receiving a response. It is noteworthy that this same screenshot went viral in 2023 and was debunked by Reuters and AP News. At that time, Gibson’s representative, Alan Nierob, confirmed, “It is a fake post, as Mr. Gibson does not have any social media platforms.”"
77,"Israel experienced an earthquake on October 5, 2024.",False,True,"The claim is supported by evidence from multiple sources. The Mirror and The Economic Times both reported that an earthquake in Iran on October 5, 2024, was also felt in Israel. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) also detected earthquakes in northern Iran on the same date.
",False," The claim is false. USGS data shows that no earthquake occurred in Israel on or shortly before October 5th. No credible sources have reported that an earthquake occurred near Tel Aviv around October 5th. The EMSC made a post on X that verifies there is no data that indicates an earthquake occurred in Israel around October 5th. The caption reads, “#Israel 19 min ago⚠ We have no data confirming this crowdsourced detection. 👉 It likely was a false detection. No more info will be displayed in the thread. ” When asked for comment, EMSC told Check Your Fact, “we stress the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of this detection. The second message in the thread confirms that this detection has not been confirmed.” Check Your Fact has also reached out to USGS for comment. Due to the tension between Israel and Iran, many social media users have attributed the false detection to an alleged Iranian nuclear test. No reputable sources have reported that Iran conducted a nuclear test on or close to October 5th. "
78,"Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.",False,False,"The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like NPR and Al Jazeera, Benjamin Netanyahu was in Israel at the time, responding to the attack and convening the Security Cabinet in Jerusalem. There is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland.
",True," Netanyahu’s Travel Claims Disproved During Iranian Missile Attack. Misbar’s team searched the viral claim and did not find any credible news media reporting on it. On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland. "

",True," The image was not shared by any credible media outlet which reported on the strike of Ramat David, which raised suspicion of the authenticity of the image. After analyzing the photo, Misbar’s team found that the image in question is an AI-generated photo. There are several distortions and unclear outlines that could be noted in the photo."

The protest was to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza, not to represent dead Israeli soldiers.
",True," Israeli Protesters Carry Coffins During Protest in Tel Aviv. Contrary to the viral claim circulating on social media, the photo does not depict real coffins of Israeli soldiers amid the ongoing military campaigns. Similar images, showing the same location and individuals, were posted by The Jerusalem Post on X, identifying the scene as a protest at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough comparison of the circulating image with the one shared by Israeli media and confirmed several similarities, including protesters wearing yellow, holding photos of Israeli hostages, the Israeli flag, objects on the building roof, and the presence of 27 coffins, arranged in three rows of nine. Sky News also shared a video showing Israeli protesters carrying coffins, reporting that the coffins represent hostages killed in Gaza. The outlet noted that widespread protests erupted across Israel following the recovery of six hostages' bodies from Gaza. Moreover, The Times of Israel shared a similar photo of the circulating photo showing the same location and number of coffins during the protest in Habima Square, Tel Aviv. "

While the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, the assertion that it is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US is incorrect. Multiple sources, including [Memorial Mapping](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/browse-by-country), confirm the existence of other 9/11 memorials outside the United States.
",True," Numerous other countries, including Italy, England, Ireland and Australia, have 9/11 memorials. Israel is far from the only country outside of the U.S. with a memorial commemorating the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed 2,977 people. More than a dozen other nations have such sites, according to the Voices Center for Resilience and Memorial Mapping. Those nations include Italy, England, Ireland and Australia. "

",True," Israeli Government Officials Took Shelter in Bunkers on October 7. Media outlets published the image on October 7, 2023, claiming it showed Israeli government ministers rushing to shelters after sirens sounded in Tel Aviv amid escalating exchanges of fire between Palestinian resistance groups and the Israeli military. This followed the launch of Operation Al-Aqsa Flood by Palestinian resistance factions on the same day."

Misbar's investigative team traced the original image back to February 16, 2023, following FC Barcelona's announcement to sever ties with Israel. The original photo was posted by i24 News on X that same day, with the caption, “Barcelona football club invites Israeli embassy staff in Spain to match against Manchester United, in show of solidarity after Barcelona mayor's decision to cut ties with Tel Aviv over 'Israeli apartheid'” "

The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is false, as the image predates this timeframe.
",True," On conducting a reverse image search, we found that several Israeli news outlets had published similar images in reports from 2024. A news report by The Times of Israel published on January 30, 2024, headlined, ""State approves repairs to pool in Netanyahu's Caesarea home – report,"" carried the same photo of the property. The image captioned, ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea,"" was credited to Israeli public broadcaster KAN. The Times of Israel also used the photo for another article on Netanyahu's house published on July 19, 2024. Another report by Radio J, a French radio station that broadcasts information from the Jewish community, carried the same image in an article published on January 30, 2024, crediting the photo to KAN. Further, upon relevant Google searches in Hebrew, we found a video uploaded by KAN (archived here) on its YouTube channel on July 1, 2019, with the same visuals at the 0:07 timestamp. The video was originally titled in Hebrew and, when translated using Google, reads, ""The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works."" "

The original poll, which aired on May 27, 2022, did not ask about rape; instead, it questioned whether the government relies on supporters of terrorism.

",True," A Doctored Screenshot of Channel 12 News’ 2022 Poll. Contrary to social media users’ viral circulation of the image, the screenshot was photoshopped, altering the original captioning of the poll behind the Israeli channel’s presenter. The poll, originally conducted by Channel 12 in May 2022, asked whether respondents agreed with the claim that the government's support leans on terror supporters. The original video showing Channel 12's presenter announcing the poll results was uploaded to YouTube on May 28, 2022. The translated caption of the Hebrew question from the Channel 12 poll reads, ""Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?"" Despite this, the image has been misrepresented on social media, with a false caption suggesting the poll asked if Israeli soldiers should be allowed to rape a prisoner."

",True," A reverse image search led us to a report dated June 24, 2024, published on the official website of the U.S. Navy, titled ""BALTOPS 24 Concludes In Kiel, Germany.” The report also included the now-viral image. The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea. The same image was used in a report on the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), a project of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The photo, dated July 6, 2024, with the description “Ships participating in exercise Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS 24) steam in formation through the Baltic Sea, June 8, 2024,” was credited to Mario Coto, a U.S. Navy employee. NATO also posted this image on their official X (formerly Twitter) account (archived here) on June 10, 2024, with the caption, “19 Allies, 50+ ships, 85+ aircraft, 9,000 personnel are training together during the annual maritime exercise #BALTOPS24, where Allies will demonstrate NATO’s ability to preserve freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea.""

",True," Benjamin Netanyahu With His Father in Jerusalem in 2009. Misbar's team identified the image as from February 8, 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu, then the leader of the right-wing Likud party, in conversation with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu, at his father's home. The photo was taken shortly before the Israeli elections in which Benjamin Netanyahu was a candidate for prime minister. The government, led by Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party, was sworn in with a diverse coalition that included members from the left, ultra-Orthodox factions, and the secular extreme right.

",True," We found the original image shared by Tasnim News (archived here) on February 11, 2024, through a reverse image search. The image caption reads, ""The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian)."" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa. The people around him match those in the viral photo. The Islamic Republic News Agency also published the original image in a news report dated February 11, 2024. The image was captioned, ""Sardar Qaani, commander of the Quds Force, attended the march on 22 Bahman. (translated by Persian)."" The report adds that Iranians participated in the march on 22 Bahman, held in Tehran and other cities on February 11, 2024. (22 Bahman refers to the 22 days of the Bahman month (Eleventh month), according to the Persian calendar, which refers to February 11 in the Georgian calendar.) The annual march commemorates Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, when the monarchy was overthrown and the Islamic Republic was established."

",False," WhatsApp Is Banned in Iran. Contrary to social media users’ spreading conspiracy theory regarding the assassination of Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh, Meta’s WhatsApp has not been working in Iran since 2022. As protests spread over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran, access to Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked in September 2022. According to data from NetBlocks, authorities have responded with a series of internet restrictions, targeting all users registered with an Iranian (+98) phone number across all major network operators.

Contrary to claims, the image does not originate from Gaza and does not depict a father holding the hand of his son, who was purportedly killed in an Israeli bombing and trapped under the rubble of their house."
96,"<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.",False,True,"The claim is supported by multiple sources, including an article from Countercurrents.org, which states that Mayar Haidar and Bilal Hamida were killed in an Israeli bombing of a UN school in Nuseirat, Gaza, on July 6, 2024, and includes the image in the claim. Additional reports from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)), BBC News ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng04kpv2do](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4ng04kpv2do)), and OPB ([https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/12/the-u-n-says-6-staff-were-killed-in-an-israeli-strike-on-a-gaza-school/](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/12/the-u-n-says-6-staff-were-killed-in-an-israeli-strike-on-a-gaza-school/)) also confirm the attack and resulting fatalities.
",False," Israel Killed the Two Siblings in October 2023, Not in July 2024. Contrary to social media users’ viral claim, the two Hamida children were not killed in a recent Israeli airstrike targeting Al-Jaouni school on July 6. Misbar's investigation team conducted searches using the names of the children and found earlier reports indicating that the children were killed in an Israeli assault on October 22, 2023. A Palestinian media agency published a photo of Mayar Hamida, reporting that she was killed along with her brother Bilal and their mother after Israel bombed their house in the Gaza Strip. The agency stated that they were killed on October 22, 2023. Misbar’s investigative team also found a published photo from October 22, 2023, showing a tweet from a friend of Nidal Hamida, the father of the two siblings. In the photo, Nidal Hamida is seen sitting in front of the bodies of his wife Fatima, his son Bilal, and his daughter Mayar, who were killed in their home while he was working as a news producer for the Palestine Today channel, according to the post’s description.

97,The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.,False,False,"The claim is false. A fact-check from ABC10, published in 2025, explicitly states that the US did not reinstitute the military draft for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)).
",True," The U.S. is not conscripting Americans into the military for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft."
98,<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.,False,False,"The claim is false. While Dwayne Johnson has expressed support for Israel, the image of him wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated, as confirmed by a [Myth Detector](https://www.mythdetector.ge/en/article/dveyn-dzhonson-izrail-flag-foto-fejk) fact-check.
",True," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "
99,<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.,False,False,"The claim is false. While there are documented instances of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image provided appears to be digitally altered and cannot be verified as authentic. Reverse image searches and other searches did not yield any results to confirm the image's authenticity or the details provided in the claim.
",True," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
