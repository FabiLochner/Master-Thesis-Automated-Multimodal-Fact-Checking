The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia was removed from an African Union conference in April 2025, as reported by the [Anadolu Agency](https://www.aa.com.tr/en), [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en), and The Times of Israel, he was also actively engaged in diplomatic efforts around the same time, as reported by the [Ethiopian News Agency](https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6302848) and Fana Media Corporation. This suggests that the removal from the conference did not constitute a full expulsion.

So, the overall veracity is: false
