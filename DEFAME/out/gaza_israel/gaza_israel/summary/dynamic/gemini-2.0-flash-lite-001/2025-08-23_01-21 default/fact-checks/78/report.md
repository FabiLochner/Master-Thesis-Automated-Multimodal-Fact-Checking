## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss potential arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Poland's plans to protect him. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) report on Poland's efforts to protect Netanyahu from arrest, referencing an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, also known as "Operation True Promise II" (<image:i>, <image:k>). The attack prompted a response from Israeli leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Iran would be held accountable. The Security Cabinet of Israel convened in a bunker in Jerusalem during the attacks.

NPR reported that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentioned an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. Al Jazeera also reported on the attack, noting that it was in response to Israeli actions. The US pledged its support for Israel.


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.
2.  The evidence also shows that Benjamin Netanyahu was in Israel during the attack, as he responded to it and convened the Security Cabinet in Jerusalem.
3.  The claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland is not supported by the evidence. The provided sources discuss potential arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Poland's plans to protect him, but these events occurred later, in January 2025.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu was in Israel during the attack, responding to it and convening the Security Cabinet in Jerusalem. The claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid the attack is not supported by the evidence.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like NPR and Al Jazeera, Benjamin Netanyahu was in Israel at the time, responding to the attack and convening the Security Cabinet in Jerusalem. There is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland.
