Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newarab.com/news/baby-pulled-alive-rubble-after-israeli-strike-gaza): 
Content: The New Arab published on June 3, 2025, reports on a baby rescued from the rubble of a home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. <image:i>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68141039): 
Content: The BBC News article, published on January 31, 2024, discusses the situation of orphaned children in Gaza due to the ongoing war. It mentions that many children have been found under the rubble or have lost their parents in bombings. The article includes an image of a newborn baby girl <image:5485> and a photo of Abed Hussein <image:5491>, an orphaned child.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza, as evidenced by a reverse image search ([Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as/)).
