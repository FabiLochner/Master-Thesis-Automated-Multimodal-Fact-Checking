Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381): Found exact image on website with title: Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping ...
Content: The NDTV article, "Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping Against Hope," discusses the Bibas family, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The article mentions conflicting claims about the family's fate, with Hamas claiming the mother and children are dead, while Israeli authorities have not confirmed this. The article includes an image of the Bibas family.

The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is **partially accurate**. While the BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family, the title presented in the image is not the actual title of the BBC article. The correct title, as revealed by a reverse image search, was "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry3jzedl1o)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
