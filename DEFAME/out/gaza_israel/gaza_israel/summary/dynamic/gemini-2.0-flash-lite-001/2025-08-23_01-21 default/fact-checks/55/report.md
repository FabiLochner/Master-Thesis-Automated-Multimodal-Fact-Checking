## Elaboration
The claim is partially verifiable. Donald Trump did state "I've been there" in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, when asked about Gaza. However, the evidence indicates that Trump has never visited Gaza.

## Final Judgement
Donald Trump did indeed state "I've been there" in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, when asked about Gaza. However, there is no record of Trump ever visiting Gaza. This makes the statement factually inaccurate.
