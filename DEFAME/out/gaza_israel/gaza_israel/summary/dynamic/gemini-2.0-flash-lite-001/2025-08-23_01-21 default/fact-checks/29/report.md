## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Jewish Congress (WJC) provides the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, which was adopted on May 26, 2016. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, but does not mention the assassination of JFK. (![image 4995](media/2025-08-23_01-27-1755912469-344887.jpg), ![image 4996](media/2025-08-23_01-27-1755912470-024829.jpg)) The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism on May 26, 2016. The IHRA definition has been adopted or endorsed by numerous countries and organizations.

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted by the United Kingdom on December 12, 2016, and by Israel on January 22, 2017. Ireland adopted the definition on January 16, 2025.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that the World Jewish Congress amended the IHRA definition of antisemitism to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" is false, according to a fact-check published by Full Fact on Yahoo News ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-not-amended-155825392.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-not-amended-155825392.html)).
