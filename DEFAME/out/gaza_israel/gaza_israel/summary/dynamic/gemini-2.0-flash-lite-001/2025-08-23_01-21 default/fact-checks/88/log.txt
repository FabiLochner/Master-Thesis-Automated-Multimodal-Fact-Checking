Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/10/iran-esmail-ghaani-al-quds-beirut-lebanon-israeli-strikes-hezbollah): 
Content: The Guardian published an article more than 10 months ago discussing Esmail Ghaani's whereabouts after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah. The article mentions conflicting reports about Ghaani, including his presence in Beirut and potential house arrest. It also includes a photo of Ghaani in military uniform <image:5745>. The article does not mention Ghaani being disguised in a hijab.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.newarab.com/news/back-dead-iran-quds-force-leader-qaani-re-emerges): 
Content: The New Arab reports that Esmail Qaani appeared in public after weeks of absence at a funeral in Tehran. Qaani was rumored to have been targeted in an Israeli strike. The article includes a photo of Qaani in a military uniform. The article was published on October 15, 2024, and last updated on March 11, 2025. <image:57>
Useful result: From [Source](https://allisrael.com/iran-s-quds-force-says-chief-is-in-good-health-following-reports-of-his-disappearance-in-beirut): 
Content: The article from All Israel News discusses reports of Esmail Qaani's disappearance in Beirut following an Israeli strike. The article mentions that the Quds Force stated Qaani is in good health. It also mentions reports from The New York Times and the Daily Mail claiming Qaani was killed in the strike. The article includes a photo of Qaani.

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the image has circulated in discussions about Esmail Qaani, including rumors of disguise, there is no definitive evidence to confirm the image's authenticity or the intent behind the alleged disguise. News sources like The Guardian ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/10/iran-esmail-ghaani-al-quds-beirut-lebanon-israeli-strikes-hezbollah)) and The New Arab ([Source](https://www.newarab.com/news/back-dead-iran-quds-force-leader-qaani-re-emerges)) show Qaani in military uniform, not in disguise.

So, the overall veracity is: false
