The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image depicts a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there is no evidence to support that it is Gal Gadot's star or that the vandalism occurred recently. The evidence suggests that the image may be related to the vandalism of Donald Trump's star, which occurred in the past, as reported by [Times Now News](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/was-donald-trumps-hollywood-star-vandalized-recently-fact-checking-viral-claims-article-119361540).

So, the overall veracity is: false
