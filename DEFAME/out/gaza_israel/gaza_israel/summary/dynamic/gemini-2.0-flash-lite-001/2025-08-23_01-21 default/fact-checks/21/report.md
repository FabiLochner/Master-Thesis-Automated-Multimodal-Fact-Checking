## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by Al Jazeera on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order to extend a funding ban on UNRWA (<image:0>). NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA, with the article updated on February 4, 2025, and originally published on February 3, 2025 (![image 3720](media/2025-08-23_00-35-1755909301-490503.jpg)).

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, in an article published on February 5, 2025, discusses a Trump Executive Order that orders the reevaluation of the United Statesâ€™ commitment to UNRWA (![image 3709](media/2025-08-23_00-34-1755909288-981428.jpg)). The order also directs the representative to the UN to conduct a review of all international intergovernmental organizations.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. However, the exact date of the order is not January 20, 2025. NPR reported the order was signed before February 3, 2025, and Al Jazeera and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP reported on the order on February 4 and 5, 2025, respectively. The order either extended a funding ban or ordered a reevaluation of the United States' commitment to UNRWA.

The claim is inaccurate regarding the date.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that Trump did sign an executive order related to UNRWA funding, but the date provided in the claim (January 20, 2025) is incorrect. The order was signed before February 3, 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did sign an executive order related to UNRWA funding, the date provided in the claim, January 20, 2025, is incorrect. According to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5285696/trump-un-human-rights-council-withdrawal), the order was signed before February 3, 2025.
