## Elaboration
The image is not authentic. Reverse image search results indicate that the image is AI-generated and has been widely shared on social media. Fact Crescendo watched the fight and did not see Tyson wearing the flag. Additionally, an analysis by TrueMedia.org found substantial evidence of manipulation. The fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson took place on November 15, 2024, as stated in the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is AI-generated and not authentic. The fight did take place on November 15, 2024, but Tyson was not seen with the flag.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is AI-generated, as confirmed by a reverse image search and analysis by [TrueMedia.org](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1638792546988200). The fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson did take place on November 15, 2024, but Tyson was not seen with the flag.
