! Often they belong to the dead lying near the surface of the rubble.

"Since the Israeli occupation forces withdrew from Rafah, we have had about 150 calls from civilians about the presence of their relatives' bodies under houses," says Haitham al-Homs, director of Emergency and Ambulance Services for the Civil Defence agency in Rafah, at the southernmost end of the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian health authorities estimate that 10,000 people are missing. <image:4850>!Haitham al-Homs, a man wearing an orange high-vis item and in protective forensic gear, stands in front of an ambulance in Rafah <image:4853>

The Israeli government has banned the BBC and other international news organisations from entering Gaza and reporting independently. <image:4850>!A gloved hand holds what appears to be teeth and parts of a jaw found in the rubble in Rafah  <image:4855>

Human remains among the rubble in Rafah

A resident of Rafah, Osama Saleh, went back to his home after the ceasefire and found a skeleton inside. <image:4850>!Osama Saleh, who lives in Rafah, looks shocked into the camera <image:4857>

Osama Saleh found a skeleton in his home on his return

"The bodies are terrifying. In the courtyard of the European Hospital in southern Gaza, collections of bones and clothing are spread out on body bags.

Abdul Salam al-Mughayer, 19, from Rafah, went missing in the Shaboura area; according to his uncle, Zaki, it was a place you didn't come back from if you went there during the war. <image:4850>!Young men crouch over clothes in a white body bag <image:4859>

The brother of the missing teenager Abdul Salam examines the clothes found with the bones

Soon after the brother arrived from the tented refugee camp of al-Mawasi, also in southern Gaza. There was a grandmother, her son, an adult sister, and a toddler. During the war the UN Human Rights Office said that that there has been "intense shooting by Israeli forces in densely populated areas resulting in apparently unlawful killings, including of unarmed bystanders."

The family buried Aya beside the school, and her mother Lina al- Dabah, 43, wrapped her in a blanket "to protect her from the rain and the sun" in case the grave was disturbed and exposed to the elements.

When the Israeli military took over the school Lina fled south."

Screenshot of a social media post claiming to show a woman from Gaza holding a skeleton of her child.

Source : X/Modified by Logically Facts

The Verdict \[Fake\]
--------------------

The viral image of a woman seemingly holding the skeletal remains of a child has been digitally generated by an Instagram user.

### **What is the claim?**

An AI-generated image has gone viral on social media with claims it shows a woman from Gaza who discovered the remains of her child while searching through the rubble of her home after a year.

The viral photograph is overlaid with an Arabic text that reads, "Gaza-Palestine." The claim has been shared across multiple social media platforms, including YouTube, X, Instagram, and Threads.

An X user shared the image and wrote, "A mother holds the remains of her son in Gaza, After more than a year and a half of searching for him Under the rubble of her house that was bombed by the occupation army! Explorer

‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips Gaza
=============================================================================================================

For months Israel kept food shipments to Gaza far below starvation rations. Now the death toll is rising rapidly

*   [Starvation in Gaza is destroying communities – and will leave generational scars](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/starvation-in-gaza-is-destroying-communities-and-will-leave-generational-scars)
    

Mohammed’s skeletal arms stick out of a romper with a grinning emoji-face and the slogan “smiley boy”, which in a [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 hospital reads as a cruel joke. His face is gaunt, his limbs little more than bones covered in baggy skin and his ribs protrude painfully from his chest.

“My biggest fear now is losing my grandson to malnutrition,” said his grandmother Faiza Abdul Rahman, who herself is constantly dizzy from lack of food. Photograph: Seham Tantesh/The Guardian

Mohammed was born healthy but his mother was too malnourished to produce breast milk, and the family has only been able to get two cans of baby formula since.

The ward at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society hospital is crowded with other skeletal children, some doubled up on the 12 beds. There are only two functioning paediatric teams left in Gaza City, and up to 200 children turn up daily seeking treatment.

Dr Musab Farwana spends his days trying, but often failing, to save them. Then he goes home to share meals that are too small with his own hungry sons and daughters.

The whole family are losing weight fast, because his salary buys almost nothing, and he doesn’t want to risk the deadly race for supplies handed out by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation after another medic, Dr Ramzi Hajaj, was killed trying to get food at one site.

[More than 40 of the 111 recorded starvation deaths in Gaza occurred over a three-day period this week](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/archive-zip/giv-32554ZVOgl3ZLUoa9/)

Gaza has never been hungrier, despite several warnings about impending famine over the course of nearly two years of war. Over just three days this week public health officials recorded 43 deaths from hunger; there had been 68 in total before that.

Faiza Abdul Rahman, who has stayed in Gaza City throughout the war, said even the time of the most intense controls on food entering northern Gaza last year were not as bad. “This is the hardest phase we’ve ever endured.”

Testimony from local people and doctors, and data from the Israeli government, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the UN and humanitarian organisations, shows food is running out.

Empty shelves are reflected in soaring prices, with flour selling for more than 30 times the market rate at the start of the year.

Even money or influential employers can no longer protect Palestinians."

 large-scale airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. By the summer of 2024, the Houthis provided Russia with [hundreds of Yemenis](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/houthi-terrorist-designation-russias-yemen-strategy/)
 who were reportedly then forced into Russian military training. While the United States has sought to ensure freedom of navigation against Houthi attacks, so that global trade continues to flow, Russia has aided Houthi operations as a way to ratchet up problems for the United States and its allies and partners.

Image: Flames and smoke rise from the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which has been on fire since August 23, on the Red Sea, August 25, 2024. The Houthis, an armed, Iran-backed group that controls the most populous parts of Yemen, have carried out dozens of attacks against ships in the Red Sea since November 2023, causing disruptions to global shipping.

“Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,” Trump [wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114167864888304754)
 on Truth Social.

Trump went on to [emphasize](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-piles-pressure-yemens-houthis-with-new-airstrikes-2025-03-17/)
 that Iran would be held responsible for any future Houthi attacks: “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!”

The US president is right that Iran plays a large role in supporting the Houthis. Russia, too, is an important backer of the group.

Back in October 2024, the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia-provided-targeting-data-for-houthi-assault-on-global-shipping-eabc2c2b)
 that Russia was providing targeting data to the Houthis, which they then used while attacking Western ships. In the fall of 2024, Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout was reportedly [attempting](https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putins-merchant-of-death-is-back-in-the-arms-business-this-time-selling-to-the-houthis-10b7f521?mod=article_inline)
 to broker the sale of around ten million dollars’ worth of automatic small arms to the group. Iran was also [arbitrating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/)
 secret talks between Russia and the Houthis for transfers of anti-ship missiles to the militants."

===================================================================

New attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on cargo ships in the Red Sea have raised fears of a renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route for international trade

ByJON GAMBRELL Associated Press

July 8, 2025, 4:36 AM

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An attack by [Yemen’s Houthi rebels](https://apnews.com/hub/houthis)
 on a Liberian-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea killed three mariners and wounded two others, a European Union naval force said Tuesday, highlighting the danger of the group's [renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 for international trade.

The [attack on the Greek-owned Eternity C](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-yemen-houthis-israel-15edf75586540201f63b7c33348fb737)
 follows the Iranian-backed Houthis [attacking another vessel, the bulk carrier Magic Seas](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-red-sea-ship-attacked-2f10bed442ebca4aa026b5dc67a05b76)
, on Sunday in the Red Sea that they said subsequently sank. The Houthis released a similar video after [their attack on the tanker Sounion in August 2024](https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attack-sounion-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-76c68f18a984d18905ce7c84e5cabe0c)
.

The attack on the Magic Seas drew international criticism.

“It is the first such attack against a commercial vessel in 2025, a serious escalation endangering maritime security in a vital waterway for the region and the world,” the EU warned. The assaults are the first Houthi attacks on shipping since late 2024 on the waterway that had begun to see more ships pass through in recent weeks.

“We haven’t seen any real attacks on merchant shipping since December last year," said Wolf-Christian Paes, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. President Donald Trump’s administration [targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-us-airstrikes-israel-hamas-278d07bc5aad75bb32e57f99a78cbe88)
.

The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following [U.S. The Houthis apparently targeted the two vessels over their companies running routes to Israel.

“If I were to venture, I guess it has to do with Netanyahu being in Washington and with the fact that, of, course, Iran and its network of allies has been taking a bit of a beating in the last couple of months,” Paes said.

The Houthis have been launching [missile and drone attacks](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-israel-hamas-red-sea-shipping-ab6fee82e73170b7e2edbab90ed6c14c)
 against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group’s leadership has described as an [effort to end](https://apnews.com/video/israel-hamas-war-yemen-red-sea-rebellions-and-uprisings-yemen-government-35148e6fbef64ec8b6fa074d4da2551c)
 Israel’s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and [killing four sailors](https://apnews.com/article/houthi-rebels-ship-attack-red-sea-yemen-bfa7d321e55c5bb59b268b82ef3c56ba)
. then launched a broad assault against the rebels that [ended weeks later](https://apnews.com/article/trump-houthis-end-of-bombing-yemen-israel-e2f08ac04024ef3d6409b4ce97092489)
 when Trump said the rebels pledged to stop attacking ships.

Since then, the Houthis have continued occasional [missile attacks targeting Israel](https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-gaza-aid-ship-attacks-0da6c2453fe2c4e5f81923c84c7d3f3a)
. The EU Operation Aspides and the private security firm Ambrey both reported those details.

While the Houthis haven't claimed the attack — they can take days to claim one — Yemen's exiled government and the EU force blamed the rebels, as did the U.S. State Department.

“These attacks demonstrate the ongoing threat that Iran-backed Houthi rebels pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. They can negatively impact the already [dire humanitarian situation](https://apnews.com/video/humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen-displacement-camps-worsens-after-wfp-halts-food-distribution-2fd6c11ad61d4047868648fb921c8b11)
 in Yemen.”

The United Nations condemned the Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea and called on the rebels to comply with U.N. The Philippines said 17 Filipinos were on the Magic Seas and another 21 on the Eternity C.

The two attacks, and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday targeting the rebels, raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that the Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes. The article mentions that the Houthis pledged to stop attacking ships.

 On 6 May, US president [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")
 announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.[\[97\]](#cite_note-105)

Background
----------

### Houthis within Yemen

The Houthi movement is an [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
\-backed [Zaydi](/wiki/Zaydism "Zaydism")
 [Shia Islamist](/wiki/Shia_Islamism "Shia Islamism")
 militant organization that exercises _de facto_ control over parts of [Yemen](/wiki/Yemen "Yemen")
, though it is not the country's internationally recognized government; the [Houthi takeover in Yemen](/wiki/Houthi_takeover_in_Yemen "Houthi takeover in Yemen")
 in 2014 resulted in the group's acquisition of the capital city of [Sanaa](/wiki/Sanaa "Sanaa")
, but the anti-Houthi [Presidential Leadership Council](/wiki/Presidential_Leadership_Council "Presidential Leadership Council")
 remains recognized by the international community as Yemen's legitimate government.[\[98\]](#cite_note-106)
 After this conflict grew into an ongoing [civil war](/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present) "Yemeni civil war (2014–present)")
, millions of residents were internally displaced, and a Saudi-led coalition responded by imposing a [blockade](/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen "Blockade of Yemen")
 of Yemen. Anyone who can do that can easily deny the connection between what is happening in the Red Sea and Gaza."[\[201\]](#cite_note-209)

### Operation Prosperity Guardian: American-led military coalition

While the US Navy has shot down Houthi rockets and missiles in the Red Sea, it has not retaliated against those firing them.[\[202\]](#cite_note-210)
[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 In December 2023, after discussions with allies, the US announced the creation of a multilateral naval task force of protective escorts for commercial vessels in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and [Gulf of Aden](/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden "Gulf of Aden")
 region.[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 The operation, codenamed [Operation Prosperity Guardian](/wiki/Operation_Prosperity_Guardian "Operation Prosperity Guardian")
,[\[204\]](#cite_note-212)
 was formally launched on 23 December 2023.[\[174\]](#cite_note-Gronholt-pedersen-182)
 It is similar to past operations protecting commercial vessels from attack, including in the [Persian Gulf](/wiki/Persian_Gulf "Persian Gulf")
 and [Strait of Hormuz](/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz "Strait of Hormuz")
 during the "[Tanker War](/wiki/Tanker_War "Tanker War")
" of the 1980s,[\[203\]](#cite_note-EscortTalk-211)
 and the ongoing maritime security operations of [Combined Task Force 153](/wiki/Combined_Task_Force_153 "Combined Task Force 153")
, the US Navy-led task force based in [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain "Bahrain")
.[\[162\]](#cite_note-Wintour2023-170)
 The operation has also been compared to the successful multilateral naval campaign a decade earlier to combat [Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa](/wiki/Piracy_off_the_coast_of_Somalia "Piracy off the coast of Somalia")
, although the Houthis, unlike the Somali pirates, enjoy Iranian support, and better equipment and technology, such as helicopters, drones, missiles, and speedboats.[\[205\]](#cite_note-213)

#### Independent naval patrols for maritime security

France, Italy and India have all independently sent naval assets to the region, with the [French frigate _Languedoc_](/wiki/French_frigate_Languedoc "French frigate Languedoc")
 intercepting drones launched from a Houthi-controlled port while Italy has sent the frigate [_Virginio Fasan_](/wiki/Italian_frigate_Virginio_Fasan_(F_591) "Italian frigate Virginio Fasan (F 591)")
 under the Secure Mediterranean operation.[\[16\]](#cite_note-itdec-20)
 India has also sent two [_Kolkata_\-class destroyers](/wiki/Kolkata-class_destroyer "Kolkata-class destroyer")
 to strengthen maritime security in the Red Sea.[\[20\]](#cite_note-HT19dec-24)

### Pro-Palestinian protests

Main article: [Gaza war protests](/wiki/Gaza_war_protests "Gaza war protests")

In mid-January 2024, reports indicated that pro-Palestinian demonstrators in London voiced support for Houthi militants."

From [Source](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/): Found exact image on website with title: Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily
Content: "

! <image:649>

The Middle East stands at a perilous crossroads today. The aggression of Israel against Gaza has reached unprecedented levels, with a magnitude of destruction that the world cannot ignore.

Backed tacitly—and at times openly—by the United States and many Western powers, Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has gone beyond the boundaries of defense, crossing into systemic devastation of civilian infrastructure, indiscriminate killings, and collective punishment of the Palestinian people.

These actions, justified under the pretext of security, echo the darker chapters of history where power was exercised without restraint and conscience.

**The Israeli Assault on Gaza: A Crisis of Humanity**

Since the renewed escalation in Gaza began, thousands of innocent civilians—many of them women and children—have been killed. Homes, hospitals, schools, and places of worship have been flattened.

Access to water, food, and medical aid is systematically obstructed, creating a humanitarian catastrophe of colossal proportions. The siege on Gaza has become a global symbol of suffering and injustice, where international laws and human rights conventions appear suspended in favor of military dominance.

The Israeli government, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a coalition of ultra nationalists, has dismissed calls for ceasefire, deflected international investigations, and labeled every act of resistance as terrorism, while justifying its own excessive use of force as “defense.”

Yet, what is unfolding in Gaza is not just a military operation—it is a deliberate strategy of attrition, designed to break the Palestinian will and erase their claim to dignity, land, and nationhood.

Shockingly, despite global outrage, Benjamin Netanyahu has been formally accused by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes committed during the Gaza operations. The very fact that such charges could be brought against a sitting head of government should prompt global action.

Yet, Netanyahu walks free—welcomed in Western capitals, unimpeded in his travels, treated with deference by media and political elites. Where is the international community’s commitment to justice? Who shields him from arrest and prosecution?

The answer is plain: a coalition of powerful nations, led by the United States and certain European allies, who selectively uphold international law when it suits their strategic interests. This duality corrodes the very foundations of global order.

**The Role of the United States and the West: Complicity Through Silence and Support**

It is no secret that the United States remains Israel’s most powerful ally, providing billions in military aid, advanced weapons systems, and unwavering political cover at international forums like the United Nations.

European countries, though more cautious in language, have largely refrained from decisive action. The so-called liberal democracies, which so often preach about human rights and international order, have failed the people of Gaza.

The silence of Western governments, or worse, their implicit support, sends a dangerous message: that some lives are worth more than others, and that military power justifies any action, no matter how barbaric. This hypocrisy not only undermines the credibility of the international system but also sows the seeds of long-term instability and global resentment.

**The Iranian Factor: A Strategic Counterbalance Emerges**

Amid this devastation, Iran has emerged as a key regional power capable of altering the balance. Despite years of sanctions, sabotage, and geopolitical isolation, Iran has built a formidable network of allied forces across the region—Hezbollah in Lebanon, various Iraqi militia groups, the Houthis in Yemen, and even influence among certain Syrian factions.

Its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has grown into one of the most sophisticated non-NATO military forces in the world, with capabilities in drones, missiles, cyber warfare, and unconventional tactics.

Iran’s response to Israeli aggression has been measured but symbolically powerful. The April 2024 drone and missile operation targeting Israeli military installations was unprecedented, demonstrating both capability and intent.

While most of the drones were intercepted, the sheer scale and precision shocked Western and Israeli military planners. Iran, once thought to be only a shadow power, has shown it can act—and when it does, it shakes the entire region.

More importantly, Iran’s growing influence across the Muslim world is ideological as much as it is military. It presents itself as a resistance power, willing to stand up against Western hegemony and Israeli expansionism, echoing the spirit of its 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah.

That revolution was not merely political—it was a deeply symbolic rejection of Western control over Muslim lands, a theme that resonates even more today as Palestinians bleed and the world watches.

**History Repeats: The West Should Remember Vietnam and the Shah**

The United States must recall its past mistakes. It was defeated in Vietnam despite possessing overwhelming military power. The Vietnamese people, driven by nationalism and resilience, made the cost of occupation unbearable.

Similarly, America’s alliance with the Shah of Iran crumbled when the Iranian people rose up, rejecting a regime seen as a puppet of U.S. interests. Today, the same forces of resistance and rebellion are stirring in the Middle East, driven by years of humiliation, occupation, and betrayal.

No amount of weapons, propaganda, or diplomatic maneuvering can extinguish a people’s desire for freedom and justice. If America continues on its current path—arming Israel, ignoring war crimes, and demonizing any form of resistance—it will not only lose moral credibility, but also geopolitical stability across a region critical to the world’s energy and security architecture.

**A Turning Point for the Middle East**

What we are witnessing now is not merely another round of violence. It is a reckoning. Israel’s unrestrained military campaign, with Western backing, is catalyzing a new realignment of forces. Iran and its allies may be viewed with suspicion by the West, but to many across the region, they represent strength in the face of imperial arrogance. This should be a moment of serious reflection for Western powers.

The people of Gaza deserve peace, dignity, and a future free from siege and war. The people of Israel deserve security, but not at the cost of another nation’s annihilation. And the world deserves a Middle East that is just, not merely stable for the sake of oil and arms.

The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice—provided we do not look away when justice is being strangled in plain sight."

Content: "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had said on Wednesday that Israel’s retaliation should not lead to greater escalation.

“We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defence and in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st,” said Sean Savett, the White House national security council spokesperson.

State media in Syria also reported Syrian air defences had intercepted “hostile targets” and “sounds of explosions” near the capital city, Damascus, on Saturday.

----------- Israel’s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been carried out.

Iranian air defences said that Israel attacked military targets in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam and that “limited damage” was caused to some locations.

Footage broadcast by local media showed air defences continuously firing at apparently incoming projectiles in central Tehran, without saying which sites were coming under attack.

Israel has said it has launched direct airstrikes against military targets in Iran, a retaliation that could bring the Middle East closer to a full-scale regional war.

The Israel Defense Forces said it had completed its air attack on Saturday morning, hitting missile and drone manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas in [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran)
. Dozens of fighter jets were involved in the operation, codenamed Days of Repentance, and all returned to their bases safely, the military said.

In a statement posted to X, the IDF said: “In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.”

Saturday’s attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a [missile barrage launched by Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/iran-imminent-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-us-warns)
 on 1 October in which an estimated 180 ballistic missiles were fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases. One person was killed in the occupied West Bank.

The US president, Joe Biden, had said that Israel should not target Iranian nuclear or oil facilities, in an effort to prevent an escalation of the conflict that could lead to a direct war.

Miscalculation could propel Iran and Israel into full-scale hostilities; the US, Israel’s staunch ally and main arms supplier, is [wary of being drawn into the fighting](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/what-are-the-risks-involved-in-israeli-options-for-retaliatory-strikes-on-iran)
 and of negative impacts on the global oil industry.

Before Israel launched the airstrikes on Saturday, Iran had repeatedly warned there were “no red lines” for Iran on the issue of defending itself. It also said that Israel had conveyed a message to Iran on Friday warning the Iranians not to respond.

There has been no change to the Israeli Home Front’s guidance for civilians, suggesting that an Iranian retaliation is not expected to be imminent.

In the statement on Saturday, Israel’s military said the attacks were a retaliation for a number of attacks against Israel, including the 7 October 2023 raid by the Iran-allied Palestinian group [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas)
, in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and 250 abducted.

Israel responded by launching the war in the Gaza Strip, which has devastated the region and killed at least 42,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas health ministry. The fighting in Gaza has drawn in other Iranian proxies operating in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

The IDF statement read: “The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th – on seven fronts – including direct attacks from Iranian soil. “The army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in defending Iran’s security and protecting the people and Iran’s interests, sacrificed two of its fighters while countering projectiles from the criminal Zionist regime,” the statement said.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said, citing sources: “Iran reserves the right to respond to any aggression, and there is no doubt that Israel will face a proportional reaction for any action it takes.”

A senior US official described the strikes as “extensive” and “precise” against military targets across Iran. The effect is to deter future attacks and to degrade Iran’s abilities to launch future attacks,” they said.

The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an “end to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran”.

At least seven explosions were reported over the capital, Tehran, and nearby Karaj as well as over the eastern city of Mashhad at 2.30am local time on Saturday, with the attack lasting about four hours. Tehran said the unprecedented salvo was carried out in support of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah after Israel’s ground invasion, as well as in response to the [killing of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s leader,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/31/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-death-raid-iran-home-israel-gaza-war)
 in the Iranian capital in July.

While most of the missiles were shot down, dozens managed to strike the Nevatim airbase, demonstrating that Iran could at least partially penetrate Israel’s hi-tech air defence systems at some of its most strongly protected sites."

Israeli attacks killed at least 19 people in Lebanon on Friday, Lebanon’s health ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

Friday’s attacks also wounded 108 people, the health ministry added.

Since Israel ramped up its strikes against Hezbollah on September 16, at least 1,972 people have been killed and 10,042 injured, according to a CNN tally of health ministry figures.

Two more members of Iran’s army have died from injuries suffered during Israeli airstrikes earlier Saturday, according to state media, bringing the death toll to at least four.

The additional service members died Saturday evening local time, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news, which said all four of those killed worked for the military’s air defense.

State media also published a photo of the four fallen men in their uniforms.

The Israeli military struck multiple S-300 air defense batteries located in strategic locations during overnight strikes in Iran, an Israeli official said.

The strikes “directly translate” to increasing the Israeli Air Force’s ability to maneuver in Iranian skies to carry out future strikes, should Iran retaliate, the Israeli official said.

The Israeli military has not released statistics on the number of targets hit, nor the specific amount of damage done in Iran.

Iran has sought to downplay the success of Israeli strikes, arguing there was only limited damage, and a number of missiles were intercepted. At least four staff members were injured, he added.

“The whole health system in Gaza has been under attack for over a year,” Tedros said in his statement Saturday. “WHO cannot stress loudly enough that hospitals must be shielded from conflict at all times.”

European leaders are urging restraint after a wave of retaliatory Israeli strikes targeted Iranian military sites.

**France:** The French foreign ministry cautioned against any further escalation, writing in a statement: “France has learned of Israel’s announcement of strikes against military targets in Iran last night … France immediately urges the parties to refrain from any escalation or action likely to aggravate the context of the extreme tension prevailing in the region.”

**Switzerland:** The country’s foreign ministry wrote in [a statement on X](https://x.com/SwissMFA/status/1850119864884552067)

“Hostilities must cease on all sides to avoid the worsening of the regional escalation.”

**Germany:** Chancellor Olaf Scholz stressed that Israel had said they “tried to minimize personal injury” during the attacks, adding that “this provides an opportunity to avoid further escalation.”

The United Nations Security Council will convene on Monday following Israel’s retaliatory strikes in Iran, according to Israel’s mission to the UN.

Iran requested the Security Council meeting, claiming that Israel violated international law with its [direct strikes](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html)
 against it early Saturday.

In a letter to the Security Council, Iran’s permanent mission to the UN said Israel’s actions “constitute a serious violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Iran and are “a flagrant breach of international law and the United Nations Charter.”

Israel’s ambassador to the UN Danny Danon said Iran’s request was “another attempt by Iran to harm us, this time in the political arena,” vowing to “stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself.”

Danon called claims that Israel has violated international law “ridiculous.”

**Some context:** Israel said it hit military targets in Iran during its [high-stakes retaliation](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-deescalation-analysis-intl/index.html)
 to Tehran’s ballistic missile barrage earlier this month.

The strikes did not include energy infrastructure, according to an Israeli military source. Iran has appeared to [downplay the strikes overall](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2pw1rhv00003b6m7hfxf2ix)

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Israeli Air Force conducted a “precise strike” on Hamas within a structure in the area of Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza Saturday, hitting several “terrorists.”

The IDF said it took steps to mitigate the risk to civilians before the strike by using aerial surveillance and additional intelligence, and emphasized it is “doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to uninvolved civilians.”

Gaza’s Civil Defense [said Saturday](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2qnldy600243b6msq9k3bo5)

Iran’s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said his country “will not hesitate to respond decisively and appropriately to any violation of its territorial integrity and security at the appropriate time” following Israel’s attack on Iran early Saturday.

Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian made similar remarks on his “X” account late Saturday stating Iran “will respond to any act of foolishness with wisdom and intelligence.”

Araghchi spoke on separate phone calls with his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Syria on Saturday “to exchange views on the latest development in the region,” according to a statement released by Iran’s Foreign Ministry.

The three countries’ foreign ministers condemned Israel’s attacks on several military sites in Iran, the statement said.

They also emphasized the importance of “increasing efforts to establish a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, halt the Zionist regime’s war machine, and restore stability and security to the region,” the ministry statement added.

Araghchi also urged the international community to take effective measures to prevent further escalation in the region.

An Israeli strike on a residential block in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, has killed and wounded dozens of people, Gaza Civil Defense said Saturday evening local time.

CNN is unable to independently verify the claim. The Israel Defense Forces has told CNN it is looking into the reports.

In its statement, Gaza Civil Defense said “ongoing Israeli targeting and aggression in northern Gaza” has left it “completely” unable to carry out rescue and emergency services.

**Some background:** The United Nations’ human rights chief has warned that [the war’s “darkest moment”](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/25/middleeast/kamal-adwan-hospital-northern-gaza-raid-israel-war-intl/index.html)
 is currently unfolding in the north of the Gaza Strip.

The official, Volker Turk, said Friday that Israel is “subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation” in northern Gaza.

Israel has laid siege to Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya for several days, detaining all male medical staff at the hospital “while confining women in one of the hospital rooms without water or food,” according to Gaza’s health ministry.

The hospital’s director told CNN that his [son was killed at the medical center](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2q5nj1o00063b6m18999kcg)
 Saturday by Israeli shelling.

It has been 21 days since Israel ramped up its military operation in northern Gaza, saying it was working to prevent Hamas from regrouping there.

Tehran has accused Israel of using Iraqi airspace in its [attack on Iran](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html)
 early Saturday.

Israeli “warplanes attacked several Iranian military and radar sites from Iraqi airspace, approximately 70 miles from Iran’s border,” Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on the social media platform X on Saturday.

The mission also blamed the US for complicity in Israel’s attack, saying, “Iraqi airspace is under the occupation, command and control of the US military.” The US has said it was given a heads up about the strikes but was [not directly involved in the attack](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2qbjngy00053b6mycycw9ow)
.

The Iraqi radical Shia clerk Muqtada al-Sadr, who is also a politician and militia leader, urged the Iraqi government Saturday to “respond quickly with diplomatic and political measures” against Israel for the alleged airspace violation.

Two Iraqi security sources could not confirm or deny to CNN whether Iraqi airspace was used in the attack.

There has been no official response from Iraq on this matter. Israeli government spokespeople have also been told not to engage with the press on details of the attack, and the Israeli military’s full battle damage assessment of the strikes is being kept classified.

The relatively muted nature of Israel’s public post-strike posture is intentional, a source familiar with the Israeli government’s thinking said, aimed at giving Iran the opportunity to downplay the strikes and avoid further escalation.

The Israeli government believes it was able to demonstrate to Iran that Israel’s intelligence and military capabilities can reach deep inside Iran, while still giving Iran the ability to contain the fallout, the source said.

On the eve of diplomatic meetings in Doha [aimed at restarting ceasefire negotiations](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/gaza-hostage-and-ceasefire-talks-us-election/index.html)
, some inside the Israeli government believe avoiding further escalation could open the door to a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, the source said.

Iran has so far [seized the opportunity to downplay the Israeli strikes](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2pw1rhv00003b6m7hfxf2ix)

 in the attack.

Still, Iran has said it is “entitled and obligated to defend itself,” and risks looking weak if it does not respond.

 striking Israeli military targets almost a month ago, US President Joe Biden had [called for a “proportional” response](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-deescalation-analysis-intl/index.html)
. Several patients require surgeries but without a team, the overwhelmed doctor does not “know what to do.”

“It’s just me and one assistant, and I am overwhelmed by cases that mostly involve amputations and burns,” he said.

US Defense Secretary Llyod Austin said the US is focused on preventing continued escalation in the Middle East after [Israel’s strikes on Iran](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html)
 early Saturday.

Austin spoke with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant following the attack, and said in a Saturday post on X that the US military continues to have an [enhanced presence in the region](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-25-24-intl-hnk#cm2ozx6td00003b6p8q09f04b)

**Some context:** Analysts say the nature of Saturday’s strikes — which Israel said hit military sites, and did not target Iran’s energy infrastructure, according to an Israeli military source — indicates that a [US pressure campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-iran-conflict-deescalation-analysis-intl/index.html)
 to limit the scope of the Israeli attack [may have been successful](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24#cm2q25xo20018356mdq13iyaj)

World leaders have been urging the two sides to avoid a wider regional war.

After [Israel’s attack on Iran](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24/index.html)
 Saturday, US officials were quick to caution both countries against perpetuating the cycle of violence, but analysts say lasting de-escalation is not a foregone conclusion.

Iran appeared to have downplayed the Israeli strike, Iranian experts said."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple contexts, including reports about the conflict in Syria in 2025 and a raid on October 22, 2024. The web search confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. The web search confirms the date and the nature of the attacks. However, the reverse image search indicates that the image's origin and context are uncertain.

Therefore, I cannot definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the October 26, 2024, attacks.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is about an image depicting Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. While the web search confirms that such attacks occurred on that date, the reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in different contexts, including reports from 2025 and a raid on October 22, 2024. This discrepancy raises doubts about the image's specific connection to the claimed event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (<image:8>) appears on multiple websites. One source, "[Islamic State" (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)", uses the image to illustrate reports from July 18, 2025, about the conflict in Syria, including an attack by an "Islamic State" (ISIS) cell. Another source, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", describes the image as a picture of a raid that targeted the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024 (<image:648>). The image also appears in an article from "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)" (<image:649>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Israeli strikes on Iran, Iraq, and Syria on October 26, 2024, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. The strikes targeted military sites, including air-defense batteries, a UAV factory, and missile production facilities. The articles mention explosions in Tehran and other cities. The sources include images of the aftermath and discuss the involvement of the US and other countries in urging restraint and de-escalation.

The sources are: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24). <image:8>


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

New Delhi,UPDATED: Oct 24, 2024 21:24 IST

Middle East Airlines is the [**only commercial airline still operating**](https://www.euronews.com/2024/10/23/lebanons-middle-east-airlines-keeps-flying-despite-conflict)
 in conflict-ridden Beirut as Israeli air strikes continue in southern Lebanon. The airline reportedly conducts daily assessments to ensure the safety of operations amid the risk of air raids.

Now, a [**photo**](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10161814286500561&set=a.10150103235465561)
 allegedly showing an MEA flight landing with a [**huge explosion in the backdrop**](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10225654114370781&set=a.10223699930077395)
 has gone viral. Many shared the [**photo**](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1070414411443476)
 with captions like, “A photo for the history books. MEA airline landing in Beirut International Airport as Israeli rains fire on the airport.”

India Today Fact Check, however, found that this photo is AI-generated.

**Our Probe**

Reverse searching the photo led us to an [**Instagram post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 dated October 21. Along with the viral photo, the post contained another similar picture of a flight landing amid an explosion. The caption of the post stated that these photos were generated using AI, crediting another [**Instagram account**](https://www.instagram.com/south.to.north/)
 named “@south.to.north”.

While we could not find the viral photo on this account, we have reached out to them for more information.

> 
> [A post shared by Lebanon ðŸ‡ñðŸ‡ç (@south.to.north)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBW7c34sw3t/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)

We also compared the flight seen in the viral photo with photos of MEA flights. We noticed several discrepancies in the aeroplane, such as the design of the tail and the blurred-out portion of the plane's body. A comparison between the two can be seen below.

![Beirut Fight AI 2](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/pic%203_0.jpg?VersionId=NMiX7NUvKvgl0_prPvNCLFNqdlPBpWvW&size=750:*)

We used the AI detection tool [**Hive Moderation**](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection)
, which stated there was a 91.7 per cent chance of it being generated using AI. Another such tool called [**TrueMedia**](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=97aaZmk9bGxIGiVd1a6P8BI0id4.jpg&post=jDH7HdTrOn7f9ZP0/22Z4w==)
 stated there was substantial evidence of generative AI being used to create the photo.

![Beirut Fight AI 3](https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/inline-images/pic%204.png?VersionId=SrNivwj6LZa81tvTZM9PAyDlKjZxlnYE)

Notably, as per news reports, Captain Mohammed Aziz, an adviser to the MEA chairman, recently [**stated**](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3283486/lebanons-national-airline-braves-israeli-air-strikes-beirut)
 that some of the most dramatic photos of jets landing in fiery hellscapes were generated using AI, adding that they will only operate as long as the threat assessment marks it safe.

It is thus, clear that the viral photo of an aeroplane landing amid explosions was AI-generated.

A post going viral on social media ([here](https://www.facebook.com/izzath.jamaldeen/posts/pfbid0i8bX8jwxbWQQbYf7naCo56yQGeg8b9SxBgB9gTjGk1AnfF9frpgdga9eL2rSco3wl?rdid=SCWXYlDOGV1CI6wT)

) claims to show a Middle East Airlines (MEA) plane landing at Beirut International Airport while Israeli forces rain fire on the airport. This post is shared amid the ongoing tensions between [Israel and Lebanon](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-war-pager-explosion-explained/article68676755.ece)
. Let’s verify the claim through this article.

The archived post can be found [here](https://tinyurl.com/28c6zgyn)
.

> **Claim:** A picture shows a Middle East Airlines (MEA) plane landing at Beirut International Airport, surrounded by massive fire and smoke.
> 
> **Fact**: The viral image is AI-generated and does not show a real incident from Beirut International Airport. It was uploaded on the Instagram account “eyesoflebanon” on 21 October 2024, with a caption confirming it as an AI-generated image. We also analyzed the image using different AI Detector tools, which confirmed that the image is AI-generated. Hence, the claim made in the post is **FALSE**.

A reverse image search of the viral image’s screenshot led us to a [similar](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 [image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=1)
 uploaded on an Instagram handle named “eyesoflebanon” on 21 October 2024. The caption of the post revealed that this is an AI-generated image.

! <image:322>

Along with this image, the user shared another [AI-generated image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBXHuXLs9Nm/?img_index=2)
 allegedly depicting the same incident.

! <image:323>

We then used [Hive AI detector](https://hivemoderation.com/ai-generated-content-detection)
  to analyze the image, which confirmed that it was 96.4% AI-generated.

! <image:324>

To further verify, we used another tool, [True Media AI detector,](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=38NoMveZlzSGuJ-nUilOMydg0gY.jpg&post=mr90LSTgA0qEyzmf8n6LpA==)
 which also indicated that the image was created with the help of artificial intelligence.

! <image:325>

To sum up, an AI-generated image of a plane landing at Beirut International Airport surrounded by fire and smoke is falsely shared as real.

BEIRUT — Israel's military announced Sunday it is now taking aim at the Lebanon-based Hezbollah's financial arm and will attack a “large number of targets” in Beirut and elsewhere. Explosions began in Beirut's southern suburbs about an hour later.

Evacuation warnings affected southern Beirut, the eastern Bekaa valley and parts of southern Lebanon. AP video showed strikes near Lebanon’s only airport but it continued to operate.

The strikes will target al-Qard al-Hassan "all over Lebanon,” a senior Israeli intelligence official said. <image:3582>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

“AQAH is a cash-based organization. A stream of people left the areas surrounding its branches in Beirut.

In one evacuation notice, for the Choueifat area south of Beirut, the Israeli military mislabeled one target, causing confusion and panic. The location was labeled as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in an upscale shopping mall in central Beirut more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.

A year of escalating tensions and frequent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the war in Gaza turned into all-out war last month. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called civilian casualties in Lebanon “far too high” in the Israel-Hezbollah war, and urged Israel to scale back some strikes, especially in and around Beirut."

Moment giant explosions seen near Beirut airport

Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah.

The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. <image:3584>!Map showing southern Lebanese towns and villages affected by Israeli military evacuation orders (3 October 2024) <image:3585>

The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety.

Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border.

Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.

Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”.

“There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside.”

Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15.

'It's still a scene of chaos' - BBC reporter outside Beirut building hit by Israeli strike

Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. <image:3584>!Dean Sweetland, who lives in a kibbutz on Israel's northern border with Lebanon <image:3587>

Dean Sweetland said his house near Israel's northern border shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon

Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil.

He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead.

“We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war.

“But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?”

“It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.”

Unofficial  
Summary 2024/8  
19 July 2024  
Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem Summary of the Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024  
Chronology of the procedure (paras 1-21)  
The Court first recalls that on 19 January 2023, the Secretary-General of the United Nations officially communicated to the Court the decision taken by the General Assembly to submit the questions set forth in resolution 77/247 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (hereinafter the “General Assembly”) on 30 December 2022. Decides, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, to request the International Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion on the following questions, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the advisory opinion of the Court of 9 July 2004:  
(a) What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures? 
The Court emphasizes that the conclusion that Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal does not release it from its obligations and responsibilities under international law, particularly the law of occupation, towards the Palestinian population and towards other States in respect of the exercise of its powers in relation to the territory until such time as its presence is brought to an end. 
On 10 June 2024, the Security Council adopted resolution 2735 (2024), whereby it reiterated  
“its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and in this regard stresse\[d\] the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”. If and to the extent that the Court finds that any of Israel’s policies and practices, or its continued presence, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are contrary to international law, the Court indicates that it will examine the legal consequences flowing from such findings for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. The Court therefore addresses the legal consequences arising from Israel’s policies and practices referred to in question (a) for Israel, together with those arising from the illegality of Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory under question (b), for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. 273-279)  
The Court then turns to the legal consequences of Israel’s internationally wrongful acts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as regards other States. 
With regard to the right to self-determination, the Court considers that, while it is for the General Assembly and the Security Council to pronounce on the modalities required to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, all States must co-operate with the United Nations to put those modalities into effect. It is for all States, while respecting the Charter of the United Nations and international law, to ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the exercise of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. 285) reads as follows:  
For these reasons,  
THE COURT,  
(1) Unanimously,  
Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested;  
(2) By fourteen votes to one,

    _, in which it decided, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, to request the International Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion on the following questions:

(a)     What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures?

(b)     How do the policies and practices of Israel referred to above affect the legal status of the occupation, and what are the legal consequences that arise for all States and the United Nations from this status?

### **Report of the Secretary-General**

### **I. I recognize that the 19 July 2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, requested by the General Assembly in December 2022, was rendered in a drastically different context – nine months after the horrifying 7 October 2023 attacks, which dramatically altered the dynamics for Israelis and Palestinians. On 16 October, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) sent a note verbale to the Permanent Missions of all Member States, the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine and all observers of the General Assembly in Geneva inviting them to share their views on proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion, in accordance with paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES-10/14](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185702/)
    _. Legal measures seeking accountability for violations of international law as mentioned in the responses received from Member States and observers include the following:

*   Providing written or oral submissions in support of ongoing legal proceedings that seek accountability for violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in the International Court of Justice, and ensuring cooperation with the International Criminal Court
*   Supporting the establishment of an “international register of damage” as provided for in paragraph 10 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _
*   Advocating for reparations for damages, loss or injury arising from the internationally wrongful acts of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
*   Strengthening legislative frameworks to support Palestinian self-determination and carrying out legal actions for violations of international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, through domestic and international courts.

### **IV. In paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Member States with relevant experience and expertise, to present proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion.

World Leaders Must Act to End Israel’s Unlawful Presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
==============================================================================================

21 April 2025

[Open Letter](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/?s=&filter[]=open-letter&tax=publication_type#search)

Over six months have passed since the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly [voted in favour](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154496)
 of adopting a resolution that gave effect to the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) July 2024 Advisory Opinion, stating that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence” in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) within 12 months. Rather than complying, Israel has intensified its violence in the West Bank and renewed its blockade and military bombardment of Gaza, breaking a fragile two-month ceasefire and further exacerbating the human-made humanitarian crisis.

We, the undersigned organisations, call upon global leaders to uphold their legal and moral responsibilities in light of the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion and the UN General Assembly resolution. 

The ICJ affirmed that Israel’s occupation of the oPt (the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza) is illegal under international law, and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations, including restitution and compensation. Any actions that obstruct the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance to the civilian population not only result in widespread loss of life and suffering, but also contribute to further entrenchment of Israel’s unlawful presence. 

**The Time for Action is Now**

We urge all states to take concrete steps to uphold the ICJ’s findings and to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal occupation. The continued impunity for Israel’s violations only exacerbates the suffering of the Palestinian people and undermines the rule of international law. 

We also call on states to urgently take decisive actions to enforce an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 446: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Mozambique and Children and Armed Conflict\

**The Dire Humanitarian Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory**

The humanitarian situation in the oPt was dire even before October 2023, marked by Israel’s prolonged blockade of Gaza, severe restrictions on movement, and excessive use of force in the West Bank. **Hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law.**
3. All states are legally bound to recognise Israel’s presence in the oPt as unlawful, not aid Israel in maintaining it, and cooperate to end this situation. Since then, in Gaza, Israel’s military assault has displaced nearly 90% of Palestinians, destroyed entire neighbourhoods, and created catastrophic conditions, with people surviving in makeshift shelters with little access to water or medical care, and pushed to the brink of famine. 

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, intensified Israeli military assaults, unlawful use of force, mass arrests, and settler violence have led to a rise in killings, massive scale forcible transfer, and severe restrictions on movement. The escalation of military attacks is not just sporadic violence or isolated policies, but reflects a strategy of annexation by Israeli authorities."

Express-Times Photo | TIM WYNKOOPThe New Jersey State Fire Marshal's office this morning is investigating the cause of Tuesday night's fire and explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha.

A massive explosion that rocked an Alpha gas and chemical facility Tuesday night was caused by a fire in an outdoor area used to store various sizes of chemical and gas containers, officials said.

The cause of the fire, which started about 10:30 p.m. at a plant owned and operated by Linde North America, is unknown and is still being investigated this morning.

No injuries were reported in the blaze, said Pohatcong Township-based Huntington Volunteer Fire Co. Chief Pete Pursell. He said the fire took crews about an hour and a half to quell.

The fire [prompted warnings to residents in a mile radius to shut their windows and stay inside](http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/2011/04/alpha_haz-mat_fire_prompts_war.html)

.

Pohatcong Township Police Chief Paul Hager said evacuations were not necessary for any of the surrounding homes or businesses.

Kristina Schurr, spokeswoman for Linde North America, said employees noticed smoke, called the fire department and activated the company's emergency response plan. The 23 people working Tuesday night were immediately ushered from the plant.

Express-Times Photo | TIM WYNKOOPAn explosion Tuesday night at Linde Electronics and Specialty Gas in Alpha fire sends a fireball into the sky.

Pursell said crews were initially called for a report of a building fire, but arrived to find a giant fireball erupting from the company grounds.

Pursell said his crews quickly directed giant streams of water toward the flames to knock them down. As the heat and flames subsided, the firefighters advanced and shot foam at nearby chemical tanks to cool them, Pursell said.

Schurr said one explosion was from a container that held a citrus-based solvent, but the company and the New Jersey fire marshal's office are searching for the cause of the initial fire. The solvent inside the container is not flammable.

Pursell said it appeared that a chemical reaction heated up some tractor-trailer tires, which exploded and were consumed in the fire. He did not know the cause of the fire.

The plant sustained limited damage because the fire was outdoors, Schurr said, adding that the plant is still fully operational.

The company makes fine chemicals, high-purity gases and gas-handling equipment for industrial use.

Pursell said his department has responded to about four gas-related incidents at the plant in the past 10 years.

The sources had previously said at least two Katyusha rockets were also fired at a military base hosting U.S. official said Washington was aware of reports of an attack instead on the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a Department of State facility.

"For details about the incident we refer you to the State Department," the official said.

A U.S. Department of State is assessing the damage caused by the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said there were no casualties.

Iraq's prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the security breach following the rocket attack, said a military spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister and commander-in-chief of the armed forces Mohammed al-Sudani.

A rocket launcher was seized in a residential area in western Baghdad near the airport and three unfired rockets were dismantled, security sources said.

Iraqi security forces patrols stepped up patrolling the areas around the airport to prevent future attacks, said an Iraqi security official on condition of anonymity.

The prime minister has ordered that the findings of the investigation to determine the perpetrators of the attack must be revealed within 48 hours, the official said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was ongoing at that time. The Reuters report mentions a rocket attack targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces near Baghdad International Airport on October 1, 2024. ReliefWeb also mentions attacks on September 30, 2024, including attacks by militias and rockets fired at Baghdad Airport. The Wikipedia article details the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific attack on a U.S. facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The evidence confirms that there were attacks in Baghdad around the date mentioned in the claim, and that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was ongoing. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific attack on a U.S. facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Multiple Katyusha rockets were fired near Baghdad International Airport, two Iraqi military officials told Reuters early on Tuesday, but a U.S. US Forces Accounted for After Reported Rocket Attack in Baghdad, Official Says
==============================================================================

By Reuters

|

Sept. official said Washington was aware of reports of an attack instead on the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a Department of State facility.

"For details about the incident we refer you to the State Department," the official said.

A U.S. Department of State is assessing the damage caused by the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said there were no casualties.

Iraq's prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the security breach following the rocket attack, said a military spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister and commander-in-chief of the armed forces Mohammed al-Sudani.

A rocket launcher was seized in a residential area in western Baghdad near the airport and three unfired rockets were dismantled, security sources said.

Iraqi security forces patrols stepped up patrolling the areas around the airport to prevent future attacks, said an Iraqi security official on condition of anonymity.

The prime minister has ordered that the findings of the investigation to determine the perpetrators of the attack must be revealed within 48 hours, the official said.

Iraq, a rare regional partner of both the United States and Iran, hosts 2,500 U.S. troops in the Middle East since the Gaza war began.

[![U.S. defense official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The incident was a reminder of the soaring tensions in the Middle East, as speculation swirled about whether Iran and Iran-backed groups would make good on threats to retaliate after a series of Israeli major blows against Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah.

Two Iraqi security sources said an initial investigation showed three rockets were fired, including one that landed near buildings used by Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, causing damages and fire to vehicles but no casualties.

The sources had previously said at least two Katyusha rockets were also fired at a military base hosting U.S. 21, 2025\

From 30 Sept 2024

**Israel** has begun limited raids against **Hezbollah** in southern **Lebanon**, the military has said in a statement.

> The IDF began a few hours ago a targeted and demarcated ground operation in southern Lebanon against terrorist targets and infrastructures of the terrorist organization Hezbollah.”

The **IDF** said that the targets were villages close to the border that pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in the country’s north.

The statement follows a similar proclamation from the US earlier, in which **White House** officials that Israeli forces appeared to have launched “limited ground operations” targeting Hezbollah.

Heavy shelling into [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
 has been taking place along the border in the area north of **Kiryat Shimona**. The towns of **Marjayoun**, **Wazzani** and **Khiam** were being shelled on Monday night.

Here’s where things stand in the hours since Israel’s military confirmed it had started a “limited” ground operation inside Lebanon. US officials briefed on the matter said they believed the “time was right” and that Israel would sign up.

A western official last week told the Guardian that the Israeli threat to invade northern Lebanon was probably “psyops” largely designed to force [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 and Iran to the negotiating table.

One day later, a massive airstrike launched by the Israeli air force killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, upending security calculations in the region and potentially emboldening Israeli officials to believe they could fundamentally change the security dynamics in the region.

The **IDF** has said that three “launches” were detected in northern **Israel**. They are mainly concentrated in **Beirut**, **Mount Lebanon**, and **Sidon**.

The media reports not that there is a challenge in delivering enough humanitarian aid – including food – to them.

A **US** defence official has disputed reports that US forces were targeted in a rocket attack on a base near **Baghdad International Airport**.

> All military personnel are accounted for and military forces were not targeted as had been reported.”

Two **Iraqi** security sources told Reuters that an initial investigation showed three rockets were fired, including one that landed near buildings used by Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, causing damages and fire to some vehicles but no casualties.

The sources had previously said at least two **Katyusha rockets** were also fired at a military base hosting US forces and that air defences intercepted the rockets.

The US defence official said **Washington** was aware of reports of an attack instead on the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a Department of State facility.

The **United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations** (UKMTO) agencyhas said that it received a report of an incident 64 nautical miles northwest of **Yemen’s** **Hodeidah**, adding that the authorities are investigating.

For almost a year, the **Iran-backed Houthis** have been launching aerial drone and missile strikes on **Red Sea** shipping in what they says is solidarity with **Palestinians** in the war between **Israel** and **Hamas** militants in the **Gaza Strip.**

It’s unclear if they UKMTO warning relates to those attacks.

Air raid alerts have been issued in **Israel’s** northern city of **Safed** which lies just kilometres from the **Lebanese** border. **This blog is closing now but you can [continue to follow live coverage on our new liveblog.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/01/israel-lebanon-attacks-live-blog-ground-offensive-hezbollah-hamas-gaza-war)

**Air raid alerts** are sounding across section of northern **Israel**, Israeli media is reporting.

The Times of Israel is reporting that rocket alerts sounded a short while ago in the northern town of **Metula**, near the border with **Lebanon**.

There are no immediate reports of injuries or damage.

**Lebanon’s National News Agency** has reported that overnight raids were launched on the towns of **Bint Jbeil**, **Tayri**, **Kounine** and **Blida** in **Northern** **Lebanon**.

All four are towns that sit just north of the border with **Israel**.

In its announcement that the ground operation had begun, the **IDF** said it would target a “number of villages near the border, which pose an immediate and real threat to Israeli settlements on the northern border”.

**With just a month left until the US presidential elections, the Biden administration launched a tepid effort at a ceasefire that Netanyahu appears to have chosen to ignore – or simply to wait out until US elections that could bring in a Trump administration that would do even less to restrain him than the current one has.**

“Netanyahu made a calculation, and the calculation was that there was no way that the Democrats between now and November 5th \[election day\] could do anything that would criticise, let alone restrain him from that,” said **Aaron David Miller**, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who focuses on [US foreign policy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-foreign-policy)
 and the Middle East.

“You saw \[vice-president Kamala\] Harris’s statement, you saw the White House statement, you saw the Democrat and Republican consensus on the [killing of Nasrallah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/deep-intelligence-penetration-enabled-israel-to-kill-hassan-nasrallah)
 and what the Israelis have done there,” he said. The peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 personnel “remain in position” but cannot carry out road patrols due to “the intensity of the rockets going back and forth”, a spokesperson for the UN secretary general said on Monday.
    
*   **US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant and that the pair had “agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border” with Lebanon**. He also said he had “made clear that the United States is well-postured to defend US personnel, partners, and allies in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations”.
    
*   **A US state department spokesperson said Israel had informed the US that it was conducting “limited ground operations focused on Hezbollah infrastructure near the border”.** The US president, Joe Biden, said he was aware of Israel’s plans to launch an operation into Lebanon as he urged against such a move."

Reuters reports that on October 1, 2024, Katyusha rockets were fired near Baghdad International Airport, targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces, amid rising tensions in the Middle East ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)). ReliefWeb mentions attacks on September 30, including attacks by militias on Israel and rockets fired at Baghdad Airport ([https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024)).

Wikipedia discusses the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, part of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, Hezbollah fired 35 rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon)). The image <image:11>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were attacks in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was ongoing at that time. The Reuters report mentions a rocket attack targeting a military base hosting U.S. forces near Baghdad International Airport on October 1, 2024. ReliefWeb also mentions attacks on September 30, 2024, including attacks by militias and rockets fired at Baghdad Airport. The Wikipedia article details the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific attack on a U.S. facility in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

Our live coverage is ending now. And Harry Truman’s picture is now in the lobby, in a nice location, not in the lobby where it should have been, but that stopped a lot of fighting, and this stopped a lot of fighting,” he said.

“I hope we’re not going to have to” strike Iran again, he added.

From 7 Jul 2025

**Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived at the White House for his scheduled talks with [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)
 this evening.**

The Israeli prime minister met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier this afternoon, the Associated Press reports, citing the prime minister’s office.

The visit comes as indirect talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage deal in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/06/gaza-mood-ceasefire-talks)
 continued for a second day on Monday.

[Trump has increased pressure](https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-ceasefire-gaza-trump-netanyahu-white-house-qatar-rcna217167)
 for a deal in Gaza in recent weeks and raised the possibility that a ceasefire could be declared in a matter of hours or days.

Hamas demands an Israeli withdrawal, while Netanyahu insists on Hamas disarming. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:

Donald Trump said he lifted the United States’s sanctions on Syria at the request of Middle Eastern leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu. They’re getting hit very hard now,” he said.

The president did not add any additional details.

Last wee, the Pentagon halted shipments of US Patriot air defence systems and other precision weapons to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)
 after concern that US stockpiles were running too low.

Trump and Netanyahu are answering questions about Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who won New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary.

In response to a question about Mamdani, who has said he would enforce the International Criminal Court’s arrest order if Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited New York city, Netanyahu said “I’m not concerned about that”.

Trump, who has threatened to deport Mamdani, who is a US citizen, said “I’ll get him out.”

Later Trump called Mamdani a “communist and said “he’s said some really bad things about Jewish people.”

**Donald Trump passed on a question about a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, asking Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to answer instead.**

“I think Palestinians should have all of the power to govern themselves, but none of the power to threaten us,” he said.

**Trump says Iran has approached the White House for talks following the United State’s strike on the country’s nuclear facilities.** He also compared the US’s strikes to the country’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan during World War II.

“I don’t want to say what it reminded me of but if you go back a long time ago, it reminded people of a certain other event. He will meet House speaker Mike Johnson tomorrow.

Earlier today, Trump said his representatives had met with Israeli officials about the raging conflict in Gaza, ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington next week. He also claimed he would resolve the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. 

After imposing his "Liberation Day" duties, he mocked tariff-hit nations, saying that they were ready to do anything while trying to "negotiate" trade deals with him.

Trump also said that his intervention and threats to cut off trade talks averted a major conflict between India and Pakistan after terrorists killed 26 tourists in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam in April-- a claim India denies. 

He has also been credited for brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after 12 days of military actions.

>  has successfully resolved several serious conflicts around the world. "Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60-Day CEASEFIRE, during which time we will work with all parties to end the War," he wrote.

The American leader said representatives of Qatar and Egypt, mediators in the conflict, would deliver "this final proposal."

"I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better -- IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE," he added.

Trump earlier on Tuesday said he would be "very firm" with Netanyahu when they meet on July 7. The end of Israel's 12-day war with Iran -- which followed a US bombing mission on Tehran's nuclear sites -- has provided a window of opportunity for a deal, with Trump keen to add another peace agreement to a series of recent deals he has brokered.

### **'Negotiator-in-Chief' Trump**

President Trump has often boasted about his superior negotiation skills. Before being elected for his second term in the White House, Trump vowed to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine in "24 hours" after taking charge as President."

Washington CNN  — 

During her [first official White House briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/media/karoline-leavitt-first-press-conference/index.html)
 as President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had prevented a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Trump’s team, [she said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-january-28-2025/)
, used the president’s [pause on foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-impact/index.html)
 to thwart a plan in which “there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”

Leavitt’s Tuesday comments made headlines around the world. And when CNN asked Leavitt and her colleagues for any evidence, another White House official instead pointed us to comments from the State Department — comments that, as we’ll discuss below, did not even repeat Leavitt’s claim of a planned $50 million Gaza condom expenditure, let alone prove the claim.

**In three previous years under Biden, USAID spent _no_ money on condoms in the entire Middle East**: A detailed [federal report published last year](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 said USAID did not provide or fund _any_ condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

The report, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-executive-orders-transgender-troops-dei-covid-us-politics-live?page=with:block-679977268f086189f840e07b#block-679977268f086189f840e07b)
 by The Guardian on Tuesday, said the only Middle East contraceptives provided or funded by USAID during that three-year period went to the country of Jordan in fiscal 2023. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.” She did not specify how much of the $102 million in funding was intended for contraception, let alone for condoms in particular.

In an email to reporters earlier Tuesday, Bruce said the entity that was supposed to get $102 million is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that [operates two field hospitals in Gaza](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/gaza/)
.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, International Medical Corps said that it has received about $68 million from the US Agency for International Development for Gaza operations since October 7, 2023, the day of Hamas’ major attack on Israel. And the president himself told an even more dramatic version of the story in a speech on Wednesday, saying that “we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

But there are at least five big reasons to be skeptical that the story is true.

**The White House offered no evidence for the story**: Leavitt provided no proof for her claim that there was ever a federal plan to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza. This was “a small order of injectables and progestin-only contraceptive pills” totaling about $46,000.

**Total worldwide USAID condom spending is far less than $50 million**: In the 2023 fiscal year, USAID provided or funded a global total of about $7.1 million worth of male condoms and about $1.1 million worth of female condoms, overwhelmingly to countries in Africa, according to the federal report.

In other words, Leavitt was essentially claiming Tuesday that the Biden administration had decided to provide more than six times the 2023 worldwide value of condoms to a single tiny territory that has [about 2.1 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html)
 and that is in a region that usually does not receive condoms from the US.

A former senior Biden official who worked on Gaza aid issues told CNN that Leavitt’s story about a $50 million condom expenditure for Gaza was “imaginary.” The former official said: “It’s a lie, they are making s\*\*\* up.”

**The State Department would not repeat Leavitt’s claim**: The White House official pointed to a series of social media posts from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who listed specific examples of how Trump’s aid pause had prevented what Bruce called unjustified spending that wouldn’t make the country “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

But Bruce did not mention $50 million for condoms in Gaza.

Instead, Bruce was vague about how much condom spending was supposedly stopped. While International Medical Corps has [publicly discussed](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story/youre-pregnant-in-gaza-what-happens-next/)
 its reproductive and sexual health services in Gaza, among various other services from cardiology to orthopedics, the organization said in the Wednesday statement that “no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

The organization said the US funding has paid for the two hospitals’ “lifesaving medical care” for roughly 33,000 civilians per month. Like Bruce’s Tuesday social media posts and email to reporters, this Wednesday statement did not repeat Leavitt’s claim that there was $50 million in planned funding for condoms in particular; it provided no dollar figure at all for condoms.

**Experts expressed doubt about Leavitt’s story — or simply called it wrong**: Experts on US aid to Gaza and global health aid were baffled by the claim that the US had been planning to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza.

“We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” said Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, an aid nonprofit that has partnered with USAID on a [five-year, $50 million health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
.

Fake said this Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms” and added: “Our whole program is $50 (million) and represents a significant portion of total US aid going to Gaza.”

[Matthew Kavanagh](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/experts/matthew-m-kavanagh/)
, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said that after doing some digging into Leavitt’s claim, “It seems clear to me there was no $50 million in condoms going to Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Fact check: $50 million for condoms in Gaza? [She wrote](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
: “Example 1: Condoms. Trump’s freeze, the organization said, halts US funding for hospital services like performing about 30 lifesaving surgeries per day, delivering about 20 babies per day, running an emergency room receiving up to 200 patients per day, and operating one of Gaza’s only neonatal intensive care units and only stabilization centers for severely malnourished children.

“If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,” the organization said.

A State Department official issued an additional statement to CNN on Wednesday that asserted that the funding Trump had stopped from going to the International Medical Corps “included” funds for family planning, emergency contraceptives and prevention of sexually transmitted infections."

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, made a similar claim on Tuesday during her debut news briefing, saying the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) “found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza … a preposterous waste of taxpayer money”.

Jesse Watters, host of a conservative-leaning talk show on Fox News, said Hamas was using the nonexistent US shipments to make “condom bombs”, floating explosives-laden balloons into Israel. What’s going on is that the bros at DOGE apparently can’t read govt spreadsheets.”

Was the US really going to send $50m in condoms to Gaza?
--------------------------------------------------------

There is no public evidence of plans to send millions of taxpayer dollars of condoms to Gaza, and a Department of State official did not respond to an evidence request from the Reuters news agency.

However, there is evidence that appears to refute Trump’s claim.

In a statement on Wednesday, the International Medical Corps (IMC), an organisation that received US funding for medical care in Gaza, said: “No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms, nor provide family-planning services.”

Its statement added that IMC has received more than $68m from USAID since October 7, 2023, which has been used to operate two large field hospitals in Gaza offering surgical care, malnutrition treatment, and emergency maternal and newborn care.

Reports for fiscal years 2007 through 2023 on contraceptives and condoms shipped by USAID to the rest of the world also do not show any record of condoms shipped to Gaza.

A former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, Dana Stroul, said in an X post on Wednesday that USAID did not spend money on Gaza in fiscal year 2023.

An April USAID report shows that the US delivered $60.8m in contraceptives and condoms to four regions – the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean – in the previous fiscal year.

The Middle East received just $45,681 while Africa received more than $54m, or 89 percent, of the contraceptives in fiscal year 2023.

The report added that the $45,681 was all for Jordan and included oral and injectable contraceptives but not condoms.

USAID reports also show deliveries to the Middle East in fiscal years 2019, 2013, 2012, 2009, 2008 and 2007, with no deliveries to Gaza.

Under the Trump administration, USAID delivered $1.1m to the Middle East in fiscal year 2019. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)](/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25029705730573-1-1738236195-e1738236527885.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

United States President Donald Trump has boasted that his administration had stopped $50m in “bomb-making condoms” from being sent to Gaza.

Trump provided no evidence for his claims – that condoms were being sent to Gaza or that Hamas is using contraceptives to make bombs – and left many wondering what the US president was talking about.

Here’s what you need to know about Trump’s claim that the US was sending condoms to Hamas until he stopped the flow:

What exactly does Trump think happened?
---------------------------------------

Trump made the contraceptive claim while listing his administration’s accomplishments since coming into office.

“We identified and stopped $50m being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,” Trump said on Wednesday. No.

Why did the White House make the condoms claim?
-----------------------------------------------

Trump appears to have been trying to frame Gaza as an example of wasteful US foreign aid spending. His administration has justified its suspension of nearly all foreign aid by highlighting examples of “egregious funding”, such as contraception and reproductive healthcare programmes.

The administration says it is reviewing the tens of billions of dollars of US foreign assistance to ensure it is aligned with Trump’s “America first” foreign policy and not a waste of taxpayer money.

The US is by far the largest aid donor globally. All commodities went to Yemen, including male and female condoms and multiple types of contraceptives.

![interactive-condoms sent to which Gaza-jan30-2025](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_0065-1738235611.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

(Al Jazeera)

Was Trump thinking of a different Gaza?
---------------------------------------

The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funds organisations worldwide that carry out health-related projects, including reproductive health.

Could it be that Trump was referring to a different Gaza? In fiscal year 2023, it disbursed $72bn worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work.

Soon after returning to office for a second term on January 20, Trump ordered a 90-day freeze on foreign aid to make sure it conforms with his administration’s policies, which oppose abortion, transgender rights and diversity programmes.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a memo that the US was freezing nearly all aid disbursement except for emergency food assistance and military aid to Egypt and Israel.

How many condoms can you buy with $50m?
---------------------------------------

Refugees International President Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw the US Agency for International Development’s (USAID’s) COVID-19 assistance portfolio for President Joe Biden’s administration, refuted Trump’s and Leavitt’s claims as unrealistic.

“USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece,” he wrote on Wednesday on X. What’s going on here is NOT a billion condoms for Gaza. After all, there are more than a dozen places in the world named Gaza, including two communities in the United States.

For the moment, why Trump made the claim and what evidence he has is unknown.

According to the HHS grants database, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Mozambique received more than $83m in funding since 2021 for reproductive health projects in two provinces: Inhambane and Gaza.

This funding is expected to continue until September 2026, according to the grant details.

It is unclear whether Mozambique has lost funding because of any confusion over its Gaza.

[During a signing ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/GbnTNGLkJOY?si=pizzIkGXX2OapqI8&t=329)
 Wednesday for the Laken Riley Act, President Donald Trump claimed that his administration had “identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, made a similar claim on Tuesday [during her debut press briefing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xJOgsQQYDY4?si=3oOdJGmBk9r925UL&t=1110)
, stating that the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Management and Budget “found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.” She called the alleged aid “a preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” But there’s no credible evidence to support these claims.

Here’s a closer look at the facts:

CLAIM: The Trump administration stopped $50 million from being sent to the Gaza Strip to buy condoms for Hamas.

THE FACTS: Trump and his spokesperson appeared to be referring to a grant or grants that USAID awarded to a group called the International Medical Corps worth $102.2 million to provide medical and trauma services in Gaza. The State Department earlier Wednesday described this as an example of “egregious funding” not aligned with American interests or the president’s policies.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce similarly [wrote Tuesday](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
 on X that the agency had “prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception” thanks to a [pause in foreign assistance](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884403944719626282)
.

Officials said the Trump administration stopped two $50 million buckets of “aid” for Gaza via the International Medical Corps, which included: family planning programming including emergency contraception; sexual healthcare including prevention and management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs); and adolescent sexual and reproductive health.

The $100 million for these programs included contraceptives, officials said, adding that condoms have traditionally always been used for family planning in developing countries by USAID.

According to the IMC, “No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms, nor provide family-planning services.”

The IMC said in a [press release](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/press-release/international-medical-corps-operations-in-gaza/)
 that it has received $68,078,508 from USAID to support its operations in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

FACT FOCUS: No evidence that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas

FACT FOCUS: No evidence that $50 million was designated by the US to buy condoms for Hamas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         ![President Donald Trump speaks before signing the Laken Riley Act in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday, Jan. They said the resources were used to operate two large field hospitals currently located in central Gaza—one in Deir Al Balah and one in Al Zawaida — offering a combined total capacity of more than 250 beds, including 20 in the emergency room and 170 in the surgical department. According to statistics provided by the IMC, they also assisted in the delivery of some 5,000 babies, screened 111,000 people for malnutrition, treated 2,767 for acute malnutrition and distributed micronutrient supplements to 36,000 people.

Refugees International President Jeremy Konyndyk, who oversaw USAID’s COVID-19 assistance portfolio for the Biden administration, [refuted Trump and Leavitt’s claims](https://x.com/JeremyKonyndyk/status/1884669087374004430)
 Wednesday on X.

“USAID procures condoms for around $0.05 apiece,” he wrote. What’s going on here is NOT a billion condoms for Gaza. What’s going on is that the bros at DOGE apparently can’t read govt spreadsheets.”

USAID’s financial year [2023 report](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 on contraceptive and condom shipments, the most recent data available, notes that only one Middle Eastern country — Jordan — received a small shipment of injectables and oral contraceptives valued at $45,680 for government programs only.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Content: "The examples referenced within the definition of antisemitism include: 

*   Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion. 
*   Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. 
*   Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. 
*   Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust). 
*   Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. 
*   Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.   
    
*   Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.   
    
*   Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.   
    
*   Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis.   
    
*   Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.   
    
*   Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

Defining Antisemitism

Working Definition Of Antisemitism

*   [IHRA and Roma genocide remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance)
    

On 26 May 2016, the IHRA Plenary adopted its [Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
, which declares: 

“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” 

The definition of antisemitism was originally drafted with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which worked with several prominent Jewish organizations to draft a comprehensive definition of antisemitism. However, in 2009 EUMC was replaced by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which decided that it would not provide a definition to any form of prejudice, including antisemitism. 

Explaining the decision, then-IHRA Chair, Romanian Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, [stated](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/AntiSemitism/Pages/The-IHRA-adopts-working-definition-of-antiemitism-2-June-2016.aspx)
, “All IHRA Member Countries share the concern that incidents of antisemitism are steadily rising and agree that the IHRA’s Member Countries and indeed the IHRA’s experts need political tools with which to fight this scourge. The IHRA’s 31 member countries -- 24 of which are EU member countries -- are committed to the Stockholm Declaration and thereby to fighting the evil of antisemitism through coordinated international political action.” 

The definition includes a list of eleven reference [examples](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
 to aid the identification of antisemitism. Universities, municipalities, religious groups and even sports clubs are among the bodies that have formally adopted the definition thus far. 

The UN Member States that have formally endorsed or adopted IHRA Working definition of antisemitism include:

!Ihra countries <image:4996>

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also been a strong advocate for adopting a universal definition of antisemitism, saying, “Such a definition can serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.”

#### Working Definition Of Holocaust Denial And Distortion](/en/working-definition-of-holocaust-denial-and-distortion)

[Next\
\
#### IHRA and Roma Genocide Remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance) Some critics of the definition have claimed that by including within its examples references to Israel, it unfairly labels detractors of Israeli policy as antisemites. Defenders of the definition argue that the wording leaves room for vigorous criticism of Israel’s government as it states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” and that it is a non-legally binding definition, intended to guide and educate without limiting debate or free speech."

**Antisemitic acts are criminal** when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

**Criminal acts are antisemitic** when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.

**Antisemitic discrimination** is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

! By doing so, the IHRA provided an important practical tool for its Member Countries.

What has its impact been?

The working definition of antisemitism has brought the issue once more to the attention of leaders around the world, making them aware that much work still needs to be done to address antisemitism, which is deeply rooted in our societies.

As a result, countries and organizations have developed national and regional strategies to counter antisemitism, and have appointed Special Envoys and other advisors on the issue. [Skip to main content](#main)

In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.

On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:

> **Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:**
> 
> **“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. <image:4999>

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why was the IHRA working definition of antisemitism developed?

The IHRA is the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues. Following the example of the working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion (2013), the IHRA’s experts set out to adopt a similar tool to help guide the organization’s work on combating antisemitism.

How did the IHRA adopt the working definition of antisemitism?

The experts in the IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial built international consensus around a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which was then adopted by the Plenary, the IHRA’s decision-making body made up of representatives from all IHRA Member Countries. This practical tool has also been formally adopted or endorsed\* by these groups, both at the national and organizational level.

*   [Secretary General Antonio Guterres](https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/sgsm19252.doc.htm)
     acknowledged the efforts of the IHRA Member Countries to agree on a common definition of antisemitism and underlined that it could serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.
*   [Special Rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/ActionPlanChanges-May2022.pdf)
     recommended that governments use the IHRA working definition of antisemitism as a non-legally binding educational and training tool and ensure it is incorporated, together with relevant human rights standards-based guidance on protecting freedom of opinion and expression, into training and educational materials for all public officials, such as police, prosecutors, and judges, government employees, educators, and national human rights institutions, and integrated into diversity inclusion programs.

### European Union

#### Europe

In late 2016, [Russia](/wiki/Russia "Russia")
 blocked the [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Cooperation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe")
's adoption of the IHRA-WDA.[\[123\]](#cite_note-127)
 The European Parliament called for member states to adopt the IHRA-WDA on 1 June 2017[\[124\]](#cite_note-128)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-Factsheet-125)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-129)
 – although Lerman notes that this is without explicitly quoting the examples.[\[94\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELerman2018b-98)

##### United Kingdom

In March 2016, [Eric Pickles](/wiki/Eric_Pickles "Eric Pickles")
, then [Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government](/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Communities_and_Local_Government "Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government")
, recommended the EUMC working definition of antisemitism, as used by the UK's [College of Policing](/wiki/College_of_Policing "College of Policing")
.[\[126\]](#cite_note-130)
 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons [Home Affairs Select Committee](/wiki/Home_Affairs_Select_Committee "Home Affairs Select Committee")
 published a report on antisemitism in the UK, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the IHRA-WDA as "helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose", as well as some of the criticisms of the definition. [Pro-Israel](/wiki/Pro-Israel "Pro-Israel")
 organizations have been advocates for the worldwide legal adoption of the IHRA working definition.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Penslar_2022_pp._133–145-12)

It has been described as an example of a [persuasive definition](/wiki/Persuasive_definition "Persuasive definition")
, and as a "prime example of language being both the site of, and stake in, struggles for power".[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The examples relating to Israel have been criticised by academics, including legal scholars, who say that they are often used to [weaponize antisemitism](/wiki/Weaponization_of_antisemitism "Weaponization of antisemitism")
 in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. Marcus writes that the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism used by the EUMC was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness".[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-30)
 The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-154-31)

Following the EUMC report, the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe")
 (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post-[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights](/wiki/Office_for_Democratic_Institutions_and_Human_Rights "Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights")
 (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 According to Marcus, the EUMC scrapped this failed definition of antisemitism, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations.[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015160-33)

### 2004 Stern, Porat and Bauer version

Israeli scholar [Dina Porat](/wiki/Dina_Porat "Dina Porat")
, then head of the [Stephen Roth Institute](/wiki/Stephen_Roth_Institute "Stephen Roth Institute")
 at [Tel Aviv University](/wiki/Tel_Aviv_University "Tel Aviv University")
, proposed the idea for a common definition of antisemitism during an NGO conference organized by the [American Jewish Committee](/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee "American Jewish Committee")
 (AJC).[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 [Kenneth S. its focus on pragmatic identification rather than scholarly understanding.[\[34\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161-38)

EUMC publication
----------------

### Initial publication

At the suggestion of the AJC, the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 The consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [European Jewish Congress](/wiki/European_Jewish_Congress "European Jewish Congress")
, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.[\[22\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010a-26)
 The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 According to Michael Whine of the [Community Security Trust](/wiki/Community_Security_Trust "Community Security Trust")
, the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism "played an active role in formulating the Working Definition".[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010-40)

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")
 on its website that shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)
 Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".[\[8\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015166–167-9)
 Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership, and "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained".[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)

The stated purpose of the working definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism".[\[38\]](#cite_note-definition-42)
 It said:

> Antisemitism is a certain perception of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews")
> , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."[\[95\]](#cite_note-workdef-99)
 After "taking into account the overall context", the examples of what might constitute antisemitism include claims of [Jewish dual loyalty](/wiki/Antisemitic_tropes#Dual_loyalty "Antisemitic tropes")
,[\[96\]](#cite_note-100)
 and "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor".[\[97\]](#cite_note-101)

### Adoption

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism in the party, leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)
[\[147\]](#cite_note-Jewish_Chronicle-151)
 The UK Delegation to the IHRA said that modifying the IHRA-WDA or not including all 11 examples would mean it "is no longer the IHRA definition", would remove the consistency of having a single definition, and "undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist".[\[154\]](#cite_note-158)

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 unamended examples to the definition of antisemitism; the IHRA-WDA was subsequently added to the party's standing orders by a majority vote of 205 by the [Parliamentary Labour Party](/wiki/Parliamentary_Labour_Party "Parliamentary Labour Party")
.[\[145\]](#cite_note-SabSep18-149)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-159)
[\[156\]](#cite_note-160)

Later in the month, a report by the [Media Reform Coalition](/w/index.php?title=Media_Reform_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Reform Coalition (page does not exist)")
 examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. While the announcement was welcomed by Zionist advocacy groups including [AIJAC](/wiki/AIJAC "AIJAC")
 (the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council) and the [Zionist Federation of Australia](/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Australia "Zionist Federation of Australia")
, the [New Israel Fund](/wiki/New_Israel_Fund "New Israel Fund")
 Australia and Australia Palestine Advocacy Network expressed concerns that the IHRA definition could be used to silence criticism of Israeli policies and actions.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Australia_2021-114)

On 10 July 2025, the first report of Australia's [Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism](/wiki/List_of_combating_antisemitism_envoys#Australia "List of combating antisemitism envoys")
[\[171\]](#cite_note-175)
[\[172\]](#cite_note-176)
 urged adoption of the IHRA working definition and its examples throughout Australian government and society "as best practice for identifying antisemitism". The report was welcomed by some Jewish organizations but criticized by others.[\[173\]](#cite_note-177)
[\[174\]](#cite_note-178)
 It was criticized in several quarters for a chilling of free speech particularly as to Israeli government policies, and a [Trumpian](/wiki/Trumpism "Trumpism")
 threat to the independence of universities and arts organisations.[\[175\]](#cite_note-179)
[\[176\]](#cite_note-180)
[\[177\]](#cite_note-181)
[\[178\]](#cite_note-182)
 Kenneth Stern, the definition's lead drafter, said that it would be a "disaster" for Australia to adopt the proposal to deal with antisemitism mainly by restricting speech.[\[179\]](#cite_note-183)
 The federal government has said that it will respond to the report after receiving a report from the special envoy on islamophobia, due in August, and a final report on racism in universities from the [Australian Human Rights Commission](/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission")
, due in October.[\[180\]](#cite_note-184)

##### New Zealand

On 24 June 2022, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")
 formally became an observer of the IHRA.[\[181\]](#cite_note-185)
 The announcement was welcomed by the [New Zealand Jewish Council](/wiki/New_Zealand_Jewish_Council "New Zealand Jewish Council")
 and the [Holocaust Centre of New Zealand](/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_Centre_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holocaust Centre of New Zealand (page does not exist)")
 as a means of combating racism and antisemitism. In recent years, criticism of the definition has grown with critics arguing that it "primarily targets criticism of Israel and that it has been weaponized against Palestinian activists".[\[195\]](#cite_note-199)

In a statement published on 3 November 2022, 128 scholars, including leading Jewish academics at Israeli, European, United Kingdom and United States universities, said the definition has been "hijacked" and urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition due to its "divisive and polarising" effect.[\[196\]](#cite_note-200)
[\[197\]](#cite_note-201)
 As of 20 April 2023, 104 human and civil rights organisations, including [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
 and the ACLU, also urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition saying in a letter that "The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe."[\[198\]](#cite_note-202)
[\[199\]](#cite_note-203)

Criticism of the examples
-------------------------

### Academic

In March 2005, [Brian Klug](/wiki/Brian_Klug "Brian Klug")
 argued that the definition's examples proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [criticism of Israel](/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel")
, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.[\[200\]](#cite_note-204)

In December 2016, [David Feldman](/wiki/David_Feldman_(historian) "David Feldman (historian)")
 wrote: "I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He also said: "The text also carries dangers. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."[\[203\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlug2018b-207)

In August 2018, [Rebecca Ruth Gould](/wiki/Rebecca_Ruth_Gould "Rebecca Ruth Gould")
, Professor of Islamic world and comparative literature at the [University of Birmingham](/wiki/University_of_Birmingham "University of Birmingham")
, published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: "Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech" in the journal _[Law, Culture and the Humanities](/wiki/Law,_Culture_and_the_Humanities "Law, Culture and the Humanities")
_."

**What was claimed:** The World Jewish Congress has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism to include “conflating the assassination of JFK with Jews and/or Israel”.

**Our verdict:** Both the World Jewish Congress and the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance have confirmed that this is false. There is no mention of John F Kennedy or his 1963 [assassination](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-F-Kennedy)
 in the [definition](https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism#:~:text=Adopt%20the%20following%20non,institutions%20and%20religious%20facilities.%E2%80%9D)
 for antisemitism on the IHRA website, which has been adopted since May 2016.

The IHRA told Full Fact this claim about the definition changing were false, and the organisation’s Secretary General, Michaela Kuchler, said: “At a time when we are experiencing an unprecedented rise in antisemitism and Holocaust distortion, we urge individuals and organizations to rely on verified sources and factual information when discussing these critical issues.”

Moreover, a spokesperson for the WJC confirmed to us that the screenshot is “purely fictitious and clear misinformation”, and that the congress is unable to amend the IHRA definition.

This claim was shared on social media after thousands of pages of digital documents relating to John F Kennedy’s assassination were released on [18 March](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-release-80000-pages-jfk-assassination-2025-03-18/)
 following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on [23 January](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-orders-declassification-of-jfk-rfk-and-mlk-assassination-files/)
.

Fake screenshots are a common type of misinformation we see online. There is no mention of John F Kennedy in the IHRA’s working definition of antisemitism.

 resembling the [World Jewish Congress’s website](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/contacts)
 (WJC) appears to announce an amendment to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism.

[One post](https://x.com/TheOfficial1984/status/1902300113055195215)
 sharing the image on X (formerly Twitter) has more than 3,000 shares.

But a spokesperson for the the IHRA—an [intergovernmental group](https://holocaustremembrance.com/who-we-are)
 founded to address issues related to the Holocaust and Roma genocide, whose working definition of antisemitism has been [adopted or endorsed](https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism#:~:text=Who%20has%20adopted%20the%20working%20definition%20of%20antisemitism%3F)

** on X, Shields shared a photo of Congresswoman Luna and Prime Minister Netanyahu during the latter’s July 2024 address to Congress, and wrote, “This is who is in charge of releasing the JFK files.”

Implicit is the claim that Congresswoman Luna cannot be trusted to lead efforts to declassify files related to the assassination of President Kennedy either because of subservience or fealty to Prime Minister Netanyahu — someone who, presumably, has a direct stake in maintaining the “secrets” of Jewish involvement in the assassination.

In addition, Shields implies that a Jew (or Zionist) always acts in the best interest of their fellow Jews or Zionists, or of Israel, at the expense of others. Invoking “[**dual loyalty**](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/conspiracy-myths/the-myth-of-dual-loyalty)
” portrays the accused as untrustworthy, and in the case of Congresswoman Luna, the purpose of the dual loyalty canard is to preemptively reject any findings she may release that do not assign blame to Jews or Israel for the assassination of President Kennedy.

**Getting your [Trinity Audio](//trinityaudio.ai)
 player ready...**

_**The following analysis was authored by the Antisemitism Research Center (ARC) by CAM:**_

On February 10th, U.S. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) **[announced](https://www.newsweek.com/anna-paulina-luna-task-force-jfk-files-epstein-list-2029645)
** she would lead a task force to declassify files related to the assassinations of President John. Congresswoman Luna’s task force is acting on an [**executive order**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-orders-declassification-of-jfk-rfk-and-mlk-assassination-files/)
 issued by President Donald Trump on his third day of office ordering the release of all remaining classified documents pertaining to these historical events.

Almost immediately, the congresswoman’s announcement became a focal point for antisemitic conspiracy theorists. Convinced that Jews, Zionists, or the Mossad assassinated President Kennedy, prominent antisemitic influencers such as Jake Shields, Lucas Gage, and Stew Peters framed her involvement as part of a broader Jewish conspiracy to conceal the truth.

Such claims, amplified by bots, quickly reached hundreds of millions internet users, according to a **[new data study](https://combatantisemitism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Manipulating-the-Narrative-Antisemitic-Discourse-and-Inauthentic-Engagement-Targeting-Congresswoman-Anna-Paulina-Luna.pdf)
** carried out by the Cyabra social media analytics firm and published by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), in another disturbing indication of the full extent of the prevalence of antisemitism online today.

**The Formula of Antisemitic Conspiracy Theories**

These individuals now see Luna’s task force as another example of Jewish control over historical narratives. The reaction to Congresswoman Luna’s announcements highlights a well-worn formula for contemporary online antisemitic discourse:

*   **Blame Jews for for historically significant tragedies** —  In this case, the assassination of President Kennedy.
*   **Accuse them of wielding power and influence to cover up major crimes** — By claiming Luna is part of a Jewish-led effort to suppress critical information.
*   **Use these accusations to promote broader antisemitic sentiment —** Reinforcing age-old prejudices about Jewish control and manipulation.

This pattern is not new. Antisemitic influencers such as Stew Peters, Lucas Gage, and Jake Shields cultivated a large following (over 300,000 followers per X account) and weaponized X’s algorithm to propagate conspiracy theories about Jews and the Kennedy assassination.

**Recent Examples of Far-Right Influencers Accusing Jews or Mossad/Israel of Assassinating President Kennedy:**

**The Targeting of Congresswoman Luna**

Beyond the assassination itself, antisemitic figures have targeted Congresswoman Luna by:

*   Suggesting she is under Jewish or Zionist control, particularly through her connections with Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
*   Implying she is secretly Jewish, based on statements about her father’s religious background and her self-identification as a Zionist.

Influencers such as Jake Shields fixate on the alleged — mostly imagined —  relationship between the State of Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Congresswoman Luna. government is a “Zionist-occupied government,” or “ZOG,” and have invoked ZOG when criticizing Congresswoman Luna and her Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Far-right antisemitic influencer Stew Peters [**asked**](https://x.com/redpillsayian/status/1890234850696888707?s=12)
 rhetorically, “why should we trust a Jewish stripper \[Congresswoman Luna\] to tell us about the crimes of our occupied government.” Meanwhile, the seemingly far-left X account “AIPAC Tracker” **[posted](https://x.com/TrackAIPAC/status/1891914590776168587)
**, “6/7 of the members of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets are in the pocket of the Israel lobby.” Unified by their shared antisemitism in the form of alleging outsize “Zionist” control of the United States, the two ends of the political spectrum seemingly mirror each other, reflecting a phenomenon known as the “[**horseshoe theory**](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/3246)
.”

Not only is Congresswoman Luna allegedly controlled by Zionists, but she is compromised because she is, supposedly, secretly Jewish. Or, as some antisemites believe, because Congresswoman Luna has [**claimed**](https://www.timesofisrael.com/grandfather-of-gop-lawmaker-claiming-jewish-heritage-fought-for-nazis-report/)
 that her father was a messianic Jew, or that she is a “Zionist,” she is a co-conspirator working to conceal Jewish responsibility for President Kennedy’s assassination."

A post [shared on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@cherryvondolls/post/DHZEyZZtl-7)
 claims the World Jewish Congress has purportedly amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s working definition of antisemitism to include reference to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.

> View on Threads

**Verdict: False**

The World Jewish Congress has not made any reference to the claim. “It is now antisemitic to say Israel shot JFK,” it continues.

The post includes what appears to be a screenshot of the World Jewish Congress’ website announcing the change.

The claim is false. On March 26, [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/fact-check/world-jewish-congress-did-not-amend-antisemitism-definition-2025-03-26/)
 debunked the claim."

You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'."

## Actions
```
web_search("World Jewish Congress IHRA antisemitism definition")
web_search("World Jewish Congress JFK assassination antisemitism")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Jewish Congress (WJC) provides the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, which was adopted on May 26, 2016. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, but does not mention the assassination of JFK. (<image:4995>, <image:4996>) The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism on May 26, 2016. The IHRA definition has been adopted or endorsed by numerous countries and organizations.

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism was adopted by the United Kingdom on December 12, 2016, and by Israel on January 22, 2017. Ireland adopted the definition on January 16, 2025.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that the World Jewish Congress amended the IHRA definition of antisemitism to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" is false, according to a fact-check published by Full Fact on Yahoo News ([https://uk.news.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-not-amended-155825392.html](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-not-amended-155825392.html)). The IHRA and the WJC confirmed that the claim is misinformation. The article includes an image of JFK <image:5073>.

A fact-check on aol.com, published on March 27, 2025, also debunks the claim ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-world-jewish-congress-151433224.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-world-jewish-congress-151433224.html)). The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study on March 6, 2025, about antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the assassination of JFK <image:k>.

> **Claim:** Photo showing China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games, which was inspired by the Palestinian flag.
> 
> **Fact:** This viral photo was featured in a 2023 issue of Vogue China magazine and does not show China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games. China’s uniform for the Paris Olympics features red and white colors. According to reports, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed support for Palestinians on several occasions, pledging additional humanitarian aid to Gaza and condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories ([here](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-asks-world-court-speak-out-unlawful-israeli-occupation-2024-02-22/)

To sum up, an old photo from Vogue China magazine is being falsely shared as showing Chinese athletes wearing the colours of the Palestinian flag.

[!Factly <image:5130>](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va1Lh751SWssBut3q81s)

Share. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games feature 329 events in 32 sports. From this, it is clear that the photo has no connection with Palestine or the Israel-Palestine conflict.

!COLUMBIA HEARS PLEA FOR EXPELLED STUDENT; Burke and Two Other Speakers Demand His Reinstatement at Gathering of 500. Burke, who was chosen as president of the class of '38, said in his own behalf: "It is a question whether the president, dean and trustees of Columbia will tell me what to think and do or whether I shall do what I think is right." Vandals using red paint and rolls of absorbent cotton marred the walls of John Jay Hall and South Hall, which houses the Harkness Library, on the Columbia University campus shortly before midnight last night. <image:1415>

David, chairman of the American Student Union chapter at Columbia, said Dr. James Wechsler, former editor of The Columbia Spectator and an officer of the American Student Union, stated that there were two issues involved in the case, one of academic freedom and the other of fair play. and midnight, according to university authorities. Police of the West 100th Street station discovered that twenty-five painters employed by the university as a regular maintenance force had recently gone on strike but were unable to determine if the vandalism had resulted from the walkout.

**When Columbia University Expelled Robert Burke for Anti-Nazi Protests in 1936**
=================================================================================

!Details about Columbia University expelling Robert Burke <image:1416>

_“The Dismissal of Bob Burke. Butler’s house and I again apologized for the two questionable matters, making it clear that I had not used profanity nor left the picket signs.”

In a short letter sent from Dean Hawkes himself, Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University on June 16, 1936.

### **Burke Fights for Reinstatement to Columbia University**

In “[The Dismissal of Bob Burke](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
,” collaborators with the ASU, ACLU and Burke Defense Committee come to the conclusion that the student’s removal is “clearly an attack on the right of student organization and action.”

The piece continues: “Burke’s expulsion is an attempt to stifle student opinion.

**Soon after Robert Burke led an anti-Nazi protest at Columbia in 1936, he was expelled. In 2025, history repeats itself over and over.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robert Burke was a junior at Columbia University who dared to protest the administration’s ties to Nazi Germany in 1936. Butler never spoke with them](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 again.

So, Columbia students made their divestment demands known through a nonviolent protest at his home.

### **Robert Burke Leads Anti-Nazi Protest at Columbia President’s House**

Before Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University, he was the president-elect of his junior class and a leading member of the America Student Union at the university. This, to me, was loyalty to Columbia,” Burke wrote.

![Burke asks for reinstatement](https://b1735556.smushcdn.com/1735556/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Robert-Burke-Expulsion-Columbia-Anti-Nazi-Protest.jpg?lossy=1&strip=1&webp=1)

_The New York Times covers Burke’s short return to Columbia University in September 1936. Heidelberg Comes to Columbia” is a 20-page document from the ACLU and other organizations that details the events at Columbia University that led up to Burke’s expulsion and its aftermath in 1936. today.

### **The Rise of Nazism on University Campuses in 1930s**

Soon after Adolf Hitler rose to power, Germany’s Civil Service Law was enacted in April 1933. While Oxford, Cambridge and others [rejected the invitation](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 and hoped their absence would serve as a “condemnation of Nazi attacks upon academic freedom,” Columbia University agreed to attend, setting the stage for anti-fascist protests on its campus.

### **Columbia Accepts Invitation to Heidelberg University**

Columbia Assistant Secretary Philip Hayden announced on February 28, 1936 that the administration would send a representative to Heidelberg because “it is the custom of Columbia University to be represented, whenever conveniently possible, at all celebrations of educational institutions here and abroad.”

_Writer’s note: Made in collaboration with the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Student Union chapter at Columbia and the Burke Defense Committee, a 20-page document called “_[_The Dismissal of Bob Burke."

Content: "In 1934 he fired Jerome Klein ’25CC, ’32GSAS, a promising young member of the fine arts faculty, for signing an appeal against the Luther invitation; and he expelled Robert Burke, a Columbia College student, for participating in a 1936 mock book burning and anti-Nazi picket on campus.

Butler was far from alone in his admiration for Germany and in his distaste for those who would allege that it had a sinister side. (Columbia University Archives)

In 1933, soon after Hitler came to power, the Nazis began expelling Jewish students and dismissing Jewish professors from their universities. On campuses across Germany, Nazis and their sympathizers publicly burned books written by Jews and other perceived enemies (including books by Columbia anthropologist Franz Boas).

Just months after the first book burnings, Columbia president Nicholas Murray Butler welcomed Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States, to Morningside Heights, insisting that he be accorded “the greatest courtesy and respect.” In Cambridge, Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School, accepted an honorary degree from the University of Berlin.

![Columbia students stage a mock book burning in 1936 to protest Nicholas Murray Butler's decision to send a delegate to the University of Heidelberg's 550th anniversary celebration](/sites/default/files/styles/wysiwyg_full_width_image/public/2019-07/Columbia-Univresity-1936-mock-book-burning.jpg?itok=TIj3a949)

Columbia students stage a mock book burning in 1936 to protest Nicholas Murray Butler's decision to send a delegate to the University of Heidelberg's 550th anniversary celebration. In the aftermath of the expulsion in 1933 of 15 Jews from university faculty positions in Germany, the newspaper called on Butler to hire them as Columbia professors. After a huge Jewish-sponsored anti-Nazi rally was held in Madison Square Garden in March 1933, the _Crimson_ opined that the rally “proved nothing” since Hitler had not been provided with a defense. “It is truly shameful,” writes Norwood, “that the administration, alumni, and student leaders of America’s most prominent university, who were in a position to influence American opinion at a critical time, remained indifferent to Germany’s terrorist campaign against the Jews and instead, on many occasions, assisted the Nazis in their efforts to gain acceptance in the West.”

Norwood, a professor of history at the University of Oklahoma, reveals how widespread this attitude was among administrators, professors, and students at some of America’s elite universities, who not only argued that academic life should be free of political considerations, but actually supported the Nazi regime. Aside from Harvard and Columbia, Norwood deals with several other colleges and universities, including the Seven Sisters, several Catholic universities, and the University of Virginia. In some ways, the student reaction to Columbia’s entanglement with the Third Reich in the 1930s foreshadowed what would happen a generation later when students challenged their university administrations over such issues as the war in Vietnam and civil rights.

The ACLU also published press releases about the case in May and July 2025.

“They want to conflate any speech for the rights of Palestinians with speech that’s supporting terrorism, which is totally wrong,” he said.

“It’s a message that they want to make an example out of me, even if you are a legal resident… that we will find a way to come after you, to punish you, if you speak, against what we want.”

Khalil told the Associated Press that if his claim against the Trump administration is successful, he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in Trump’s “failed” effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech.

Mahmoud Khalil describes conditions at ICE detention facility

01:24

CNN  — 

Detained for more than 100 days without charge, and with the threat of deportation looming over him, Palestinian student activist [Mahmoud Khalil](https://cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 was convinced he would eventually prevail.

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Khalil, who is now back with his young family, describes the months languishing in a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, and the pain of being denied permission to be present at his son’s birth.

“It was a very, very dehumanizing experience, for someone who was not accused of any crime, whatsoever,” said Khalil, a green card holder who had no formal criminal or civil charges brought against him.

His detention sparked outrage across the US.

On Thursday Khalil’s lawyers [filed a claim](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 against the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned, prosecuted and portrayed as antisemitic as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The 30-year-old, who was born in a refugee camp in Syria before going on to graduate from Columbia, had played a prominent role negotiating on behalf of pro-Palestinian protesters at the university.

Once taken, he was moved first to New Jersey, then to Texas, and finally to an ICE detention center in Louisiana – more than 1,000 miles away from his wife, a US citizen, who was then eight months pregnant.

“I was literally moved from one place to another, like an object,” he recalled, referring to his [transfers](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/us/mahmoud-khalil-palestinian-activist-trump)
 to different detention facilities. “I was shackled all the time,” he said.

But, he said, the days in the detention center never broke his spirit.

“From the moment that I was detained, I knew that I would eventually prevail,” he said.

“What I simply did is protesting a genocide.”

Israel has repeatedly pushed back against claims its war in Gaza is a genocide.

Protesters rally in support of detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in March in New York.

The food in the ICE center in Louisiana was nearly “inedible,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security in a statement called Khalil’s claim “absurd.”

His arrest outside his apartment on Columbia University’s campus in New York City in March, as he returned home from a dinner with his wife, felt like a “kidnap,” he told Amanpour.

Plainclothes agents had followed him into the lobby of his building, and threatened his wife with arrest if she didn’t separate from him, he said. His lawyers have vehemently pushed back on that assertion.

After accusing him – without evidence – of being a Hamas sympathizer, the Trump administration, who sought Khalil’s [deportation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/index.html)
, said it was [justified](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-green-card-trump-administration)
 because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident. After being served meat that made him vomit, he switched to vegetarian options, he said.

The center was bitterly cold, but repeated requests for blankets were ignored, he said.

“The moment you enter such ICE facilities, your rights literally stay outside,” he told Amanpour.

CNN has previously reached out to ICE for comment about the conditions at its Louisiana facilities – its policies indicate detention is non-punitive. The GEO Group, the corporation that runs the facility where Khalil was held, has denied allegations of abuse.

The Trump administration has argued that Khalil’s actions pose a threat to its foreign policy goal of combatting antisemitism. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration’s deportation policies.

‘I couldn’t hold him’
---------------------

Amid the inedible food, the cold, and fear he might be deported, one moment stood out as the hardest to bear – immigration officials denying him permission to be present at the birth of his firstborn child.

Attorneys for Khalil in May said officials at the Louisiana center cited a “blanket no-contact visitation policy” and unspecified security concerns as part of their reason to deny the request.

“Missing the birth of my child."

Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?
==========================================================================

20 June 2025

! On 20 June, a judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released.

Born in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of "un-American activity".

Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. They accused the government of "open repression of student activism and political speech".

Mr Khalil's arrest was the highest-profile in Trump's crackdown on international student protesters, as video of his arrest whipped around social media and the birth of his first child in April, which he was still detained, made international headlines.

Khalil's work for UK in Middle East
-----------------------------------

Born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor.

More recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.

The UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago.

Mr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. <image:5147>!Getty Images Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil talks to the press during the press briefing organized by Pro-Palestinian protesters who set up a new encampment at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus <image:5150>Getty Images

Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. <image:5147>!Getty Images A protester in New York City with green hair and sunglasses holds up a sign that reads: "RELEASE MAHMOUD" <image:5148>Getty Images

Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.

The case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.

Mr Khalil was held in an immigration facility in Louisiana for three months before a federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump could no longer detain or deport him. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".

The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.

Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.

After Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of "leading activities aligned to Hamas" but did not provide further details.

The White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.

Legal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.

"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration," said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.

Khalil had been briefly suspended from Columbia
-----------------------------------------------

Watch: The BBC speaks to Columbia student after suspension

Amid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.

At the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.

It is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.

"\[They said\] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me)," he said in an interview in early May. From then until mid-June he was held by immigration authorities on two charges.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue Mr Khalil's presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences".

In early June, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz [ruled Rubio's justification for detaining](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd28em88ezo)
 Mr Khalil was likely unconstitutional and said the US government could not detain or deport a legal US resident under that reasoning.

Attorneys for the Trump administration then said Mr Khalil was being held for a different reason, failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024.

But on 20 June, Judge Farbiarz ordered him to be released on bail.

The White House maintains the judge did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release and said they plan to appeal.

Mahmoud Khalil’s hopes of being freed on bond as he continues fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to deport him were dashed Friday, despite a judge [saying](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-update)
 the government could no longer hold Khalil on the premise that his presence in the country is against the national interest.

Judge Michael Farbiarz said the [determination](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.564334/gov.uscourts.njd.564334.198.1.pdf)
 by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student’s presence in the country had “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States” was likely unconstitutional.

But attorneys for the Department of Justice said the judge’s decision did not prevent them from continuing to hold Khalil on a second claim – that he failed to give required information in his application to become a legal permanent resident of the US, in their response letter to the judge on Friday.

Farbiarz did not specifically strike down that charge as a reason for detaining Khalil – a distinction the Trump administration is seizing on – and on Friday the judge ruled that the administration’s interpretation of his order is correct.

Farbiarz denied Khalil’s request for relief on Friday afternoon, saying his legal team “did not put forward factual evidence as to why it might be unlawful to detain him on the second charge.”

Khalil, who played a central role in negotiations on behalf of pro-Palestinian student protesters last year, has not been charged with a crime.

The lawful permanent resident – who is also married to a US citizen – now remains at the Louisiana ICE detention center, where he has been held for more than three months after he was arrested outside his apartment on Columbia University’s campus in March. He has missed out on several milestones due to his detainment: notably the birth of his first child in April and his Columbia graduation.

After the judge’s Friday ruling, one of Khalil’s attorneys, Amy Greer, said the administration is “now using cruel, transparent delay tactics to keep him away from his wife and newborn son ahead of their first Father’s Day as a family.”

“Instead of celebrating together, he is languishing in ICE detention as punishment for his advocacy on behalf of his fellow Palestinians. It is unjust, it is shocking, and it is disgraceful,” Greer said in a statement.

“The deadline has come and gone and Mahmoud Khalil must be released immediately. Anything further is an attempt to prolong his unconstitutional, arbitrary, and cruel detention,” Khalil’s legal team said in a statement Friday morning.

The Syrian-born Palestinian refugee is one of several foreign nationals the Trump administration has accused of posing a national security threat due to alleged ties to terrorist organizations – a claim his attorneys have repeatedly disputed.

His detention has sparked protests across the country from supporters who believe his detention is a flagrant violation of [core American values](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/us/protests-legal-illegal-constitution-trump/index.html)
, including the protection of free speech.

The administration has relied on an obscure section of US law to argue that Khalil should be deported because his presence in the United States threatens the administration’s foreign policy goal of combatting antisemitism.

His lawyers, meanwhile, challenged the legality of Khalil’s detention and contend he was targeted for his pro-Palestinian views in violation of his constitutional rights. In the nearly 100 days since his arrest, at least three other international college students have been released from [detention](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/us/what-we-know-college-activists-immigration-hnk/index.html)
 after weeks of legal action by their attorneys. Khalil’s case, in contrast, has dragged on for months in a federal district court in New Jersey and an administrative immigration court in Louisiana.

The administration had been given until 9:30 a.m."

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/world/middle-east/obituary-tough-talking-haniyeh-was-seen-more-moderate-face-hamas-2024-07-31/)

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-told-netanyahu-he-wants-gaza-war-over-by-time-he-enters-office-sources/): 
Content: "(Prime Minister's Office)

Former US president Donald Trump has told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he wants Israel to wrap up the war in Gaza by the time he returns to office if he wins the election, two sources familiar with the matter revealed to The Times of Israel this week.

The message was first conveyed when the Republican presidential nominee hosted the Israeli premier at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort in July, according to a former Trump administration official and an Israeli official.

While Trump has publicly [confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-i-told-netanyahu-get-your-victory-quickly-because-the-killing-has-to-stop/)
 having told Netanyahu that he wants Israel to win the war quickly, the sources speaking to The Times of Israel are the first to reveal that a timeline was attached to that request.

The former US official stressed that Trump wasn’t specific in his appeal to Netanyahu and could well back “residual” IDF activity in Gaza, so long as Jerusalem has officially ended the war.

Netanyahu has long stressed that Israel will maintain overriding security control of Gaza for the foreseeable future after the war, and other Israeli officials have spoken about the IDF maintaining a buffer zone inside the Strip while regularly re-entering areas throughout the enclave when it detects Hamas trying to regroup.

But the prime minister [indicated](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/in-recording-netanyahu-pessimistic-on-hostage-deal-israel-looking-for-partial-agreement/)
 on Monday that Israel is not yet at the conflict wrap-up stage, telling Likud MKs in a quickly leaked recording from a faction meeting that he cannot agree to Hamas’s demand to end the war in exchange for the 101 hostages it still holds.

[! (Israel Defense Forces)

Trump in recent weeks has [indicated](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-claims-netanyahu-disregarded-bidens-advice-on-war-was-right-to-do-so/)
 that he’d give Israel freer reign to make decisions, slamming US President Joe Biden for trying to restrict the potential targets of Jerusalem’s retaliation to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack.

The former US official clarified that the pre-inauguration day victory that Trump wants Israel to secure in Gaza also includes the return of the hostages.

Trump, himself, [warned](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-those-holding-us-hostages-will-pay-a-very-big-price-if-theyre-not-freed/)
 at the Republican National Convention in July that those holding American hostages abroad will “pay a very big price” if they aren’t released before he assumes office.

The Trump campaign and Netanyahu’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump and Netanyahu have spoken several times since their July Mar-a-Lago meeting, and Trump said last week that the prime minister had just called him two days in a row.

Earlier this month, two senior Israeli officials [told](https://www.timesofisrael.com/if-trump-wins-israeli-officials-fear-clash-over-inability-to-quickly-end-gaza-war/)
 The Times of Israel that they were concerned about Trump’s repeated calls for Israel to end the Gaza war quickly, fearing an inability to do so will lead to a clash if the former US president wins next week’s election and returns to office in January.

“There are internal political constraints to ending the war quickly,” one of the Israeli officials from the security establishment said at the time.

While declining to elaborate, he appeared to refer to the makeup of Netanyahu’s coalition, which includes far-right elements who have opposed hostage deal proposals conditioned on a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

Former US president Donald Trump (center) greets Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Florida, July 26, 2024. A second Israeli official said this has contributed to the war dragging on, as Jerusalem struggles to find a viable alternative to fill the power vacuum in Gaza, thereby allowing Hamas to regain its footing in areas where the IDF has left.

A lawmaker from the opposition — also speaking on condition of anonymity — acknowledged that dragging out the war through the January 20 inauguration would also sour relations with Vice President Kamala Harris, if she were to win in November.

However, “Netanyahu has managed clashes with Democratic presidents without paying a heavy price. <image:5314>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/56e3227d-48d6-4281-8bbc-5d76b790e9c7.jpg)

Trump calls Harris remarks on Israel 'disrespectful' in meeting with Netanyahu

Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will send a delegation to Rome for talks aimed at ending Israel's war with Hamas, but took aim at comments by Kamala Harris that she would "not be silent" about the "tragedy" in Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister's comments came on Friday during a visit to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, a day after he discussed ceasefire efforts with US President Joe Biden and Ms Harris, the vice-president, in Washington.

The Biden administration said Israel and the US were closing "gaps" on the issue. Ms Harris, the presumptive Democrat presidential candidate, however, said that she would "not be silent" on the "tragedy" and the "suffering" of Gazan civilians as she called for all parties to reach an agreement.

"It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination," Ms Harris said.

After his meeting with Trump, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel would send negotiators "probably at the beginning of the week" to talks in Rome.

He said that there was "some movement" on ceasefire efforts "because of the military pressure we exerted".

However, he said that "I think to the extent that Hamas understands that there's no daylight between Israel and the United States, that it expedites the deal," he said. The talks are scheduled to begin on Sunday.

They will discuss a deal to end hostilities and return hostages still held in Gaza.

Trump said on Friday that he would commit to seeking peace if re-elected, and attacked Ms Harris's comments the day before as "disrespectful" to Israel.

He said that his own relationship with Mr Netanyahu was "always good. The proposal was immediately rejected by the Palestinian Authority.

* * * Many remain in Gaza.

The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 39,000 people have been killed in Israel's military response in Gaza.

The chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court has requested arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu and several Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes. "And I hope that those \[Harris's\] comments don't change that."

Hamas invaded southern Israel on 7 October last year, killing more than 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, and taking 251 people hostage. No president has done what I've done for Israel and we've always had a very good relationship."

Trump's administration upended several longstanding US policies on the Middle East and Israel.

It announced plans to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a decision that enraged Palestinians and their allies, who said it endangered the long-held goal of making occupied East Jerusalem the capital of a future Palestinian state.

The administration also withdrew from an international deal with Iran aimed at halting its nuclear weapons programme - a move backed by Israel but criticised by European states.

It developed the "Abraham accords", which sought to normalise relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.

And it offered a "Trump peace plan" that would have unified Jerusalem as Israel's capital and given it sovereignty over many parts of the occupied West Bank."

([https://www.reuters.com/world/netanyahu-denies-report-he-spoke-trump-about-gaza-talks-2024-08-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/netanyahu-denies-report-he-spoke-trump-about-gaza-talks-2024-08-15/)) <image:5317> The BBC reports that on July 26, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. The article does not mention a phone call on August 14, 2024, or Trump telling Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o))


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the report that they spoke about a Gaza ceasefire. Newsweek states that Trump was accused of urging Netanyahu not to make a deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, but this is an accusation, and the claim is denied.

The evidence does not confirm that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.


## Final Judgement
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign is an accusation that both Trump and Netanyahu denied. `false`

## Summary

The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was a phone call between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a Gaza ceasefire, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the report that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
1.  The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Instead, it is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewish identity for immigration.
2.  The evidence mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information, implying that the use of genetic information is regulated, not illegal.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Nature.com discusses a bill proposing stringent restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel, passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee (<image:k> [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)).


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Instead, it is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewish identity for immigration.
2.  The evidence mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information, implying that the use of genetic information is regulated, not illegal.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but it is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewish identity for immigration. Additionally, there are regulations on the use of genetic information. Therefore, the claim is not accurate. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there are regulations on the use of genetic information, DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Evidence from Harvard University ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and Nature.com ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)) indicates that DNA testing is used for purposes like determining Jewish identity for immigration and is subject to legal restrictions, not outright prohibition.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GENE DEMBY, HOST:

What's good? One of the early ideas that inspired Baldwin's thoughts about Israel came out of the late 1880s.

ALAMED: And the idea that, you know, Black people, Black Americans - you know, speaking in American context - deserve a state, a country of their own.

ULABY: So back in the decades before James Baldwin was born, Nadia says a lot of Black intellectuals were incredibly inspired by the new Zionist movement that was emerging among Jews around the world.

DEMBY: Right. And that brings us to 1948 when James Baldwin wrote one of his first major essays.

DEMBY: 1948 - that was also the year Israel was created, right?

ULABY: Right. - 13 years old at the time.

ULABY: That visit changed James Baldwin's life but not in the way that he expected.

ALAMED: He thinks of Israel as, like, a safe haven for himself as a gay Black man. How do you define one people's freedom over - against another?

ALAMED: So that becomes a crucial step for him, and he will go back - Baldwin will go back to his trip to Israel many, many times in his writing.

DEMBY: When we come back...

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

DEMBY: That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Gene.

ULABY: Neda.

DEMBY: CODE SWITCH.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: So we're talking about James Baldwin, the writer and thinker whose ideas about race and power seem so prophetic that they continue to be rediscovered by new audiences at some of our most intense political moments. Both of us have stood outside the chalk circle awaiting our sentence, but the judge this time was not just.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ULABY: James Baldwin, says Keith Feldman, saw his work as a writer as bearing witness.

FELDMAN: Bearing witness in an unvarnished way to injustice.

ULABY: So I asked, what does it have to tell us now at a moment of such pain and sorrow for Palestinians, Israelis, people across the Middle East, for us?

FELDMAN: Baldwin shows us ways of sitting with history and sitting with pain, sitting with trauma, sitting with vulnerability.

ULABY: And finding connections across cultures and geographies.

FELDMAN: Baldwin reminds us that the distance between here and there is much less than it might seem sometimes, and being able to bridge that distance is a political act and is also an act of the imagination.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: Once again, the story we just heard was reported by Neda Ulaby, a correspondent on NPR's culture desk. So on this episode, we're looking back to the writing of James Baldwin, whose views on the country transformed significantly over the course of his life. James Baldwin, the activist and author, was being profiled on ABC News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SYLVIA CHASE: James Baldwin is one of those lucky people who's never been unsure of his family's love.

DEMBY: The crew visited him at his home in Harlem and sat down for dinner with James Baldwin and his family.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMBY: And at one point, Baldwin makes this observation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES BALDWIN: The American sense of reality is dictated by what Americans are trying to avoid.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DEMBY: What Americans are trying to avoid - in that moment, Baldwin was talking about the American legacy of slavery."

From [Source](https://stevesalaita.com/james-baldwin-and-the-jewish-state/): 
Content: " Rather than dispensing platitudes about conflict and peace, he identifies Zionism as a concern of Western imperialism:

> Whenever Israel is mentioned one is required, it appears sometimes to me, to maintain a kind of pious silence.  Well, why?  It is a state like other states.  It has come into existence in a peculiar way.  But it does not, does not, become a state because people who wrote the Balfour Declaration, or Winston Churchill, or for that matter anyone in Europe, or in the Western world, really cared what happened to the Jews.  I wish I could say differently, but I would be lying if I did—it came into existence as a means of protecting Western interests at the gate of the Middle East. 

Baldwin reinforces this point when somebody from the audience questions the validity of implying that Israel “was set up to protect oil interests in that area.”  Baldwin responds:  “I said to protect the vital interests of the Western world, and I don’t mean to be sardonic or cynical, but I would be lying to you and lying by my own experience if I said to you that the Europeans—the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the French—impressed me as having any vivid concern for Jews.”  He returns to the theme of Jewish people being either disposable or instrumentalized in traditions of Western capitalism. 

For Baldwin, Zionism isn’t an atavistic cultural or religious attribute, but the modern articulation of an age-old colonial logic.  “In order to be a Zionist,” he notes, “it is not necessary to love the Jews.  I know some Zionists who are definitely anti-Semitic.”  This point impugns some of Zionism’s basic premises:  that Israel embodies Jewishness; that Israel is a necessary response to anti-Semitism; that Israel offers a utopian model of nationhood.  He has to be, since I am a black man, and, as he supposes, his only protection against the fate which drove him to [America](https://www.thenation.com/article/open-letter-born-again/)
.” 

Baldwin views Jewish aspirations to whiteness as a foolish conciliation to inherently hostile forces:  “But the state of Israel was not created for the salvation of the Jews; it was created for the salvation of the Western interests.  It happened to be, to spell it out, white South Africa. 

Here Baldwin reduces a baroque analysis to its essentials.  Zionism facilitates global structures of white supremacy and so cultural or religious investment in the ideology hinders an ethical politics.  Of course Israel sided with white South Africa.  Of course Israel expedites US and European machinations in the so-called Middle East.  That’s why it was created.  Destroying Palestine was a prelude to reactionary alliances. 

Last week, Facebook [revealed](https://www.apnews.com/7d334cb8793f49889be1bbf89f47ae5c)
 that an Israeli consulting firm has meddled in elections throughout the Global South, what a company spokesman called “a staggering diversity of regions.”  Baldwin wouldn’t have been surprised and neither should anybody else.  Israel, after all, is a longtime [interloper](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/israel-us-elections-intervention-russia-noam-chomsky-donald-trump-a8470481.html)
 in US elections.  In a world bifurcated according to geographies of wealth and deprivation, Israel serves the transnational class of war partisans, mercenary firms, and arms merchants. 

Baldwin recognized what too many luminaries in the Western left ignore:  Israel isn’t a reconstructed product of its surroundings or a benign ideal unmoored from some noble origin; it is a portal to limitless imposition of discipline onto an expendable, alien world.

24 thoughts on “James Baldwin and the Jewish State”
---------------------------------------------------

1. <image:1606>

For James Baldwin, nothing started or stopped at the borders of the United States.  His comments about Black-Jewish tension in the country of his birth took on worldly dimensions, offering unusual insight into domestic race relations, international affairs, and conflict in the Middle East. 

Baldwin wasn’t a policy wonk, but, befitting a person of his stature, he commented regularly on contemporary issues of global import.  Public figures don’t normally escape questions about Palestine and Israel; Baldwin was no exception.  The few times he spoke about the region reveal a thinker of significant prescience and a skilled rhetorician who doesn’t allow audiences the luxury of comfort. 

His most notable assessment of Zionism and Israel arose in context of a 1984 controversy surrounding then-Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, whose campaign represented a milestone in Black and progressive politics.  Jackson used the epithet “Hymietown” to describe New York City in what he thought was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist.  (“Hymie” is an anti-Jewish slur.)  When the comment was reported, it erupted into scandal. 

Baldwin, who claimed that “Jesse is singled out for particular reasons,” discussed the controversy at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, featured in [_The Cross of Redemption_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/7754/the-cross-of-redemption-by-james-baldwin-edited-with-an-introduction-by-randall-kenan/9780307275967)
, an anthology of uncollected talks, essays, and reviews (Baldwin was a stringent, at times unforgiving, reviewer).  Because the Q&A is transcribed, we get to witness Baldwin speaking extemporaneously. 

It is a remarkable document, in part because the audience doesn’t seem to get what Baldwin is saying.  Among other uses, the ideology shows how likely, even necessary, it is in imperialist cosmologies to uncouple humans who occupy a territory from the economic utility of nation-states that exist in their name. 

What does it mean to be an anti-Semitic Zionist?  (Baldwin is correct, by the way; evangelical Christian leaders, Western heads of state, and Gulf Arab billionaires all in some way fit the label.)  It shows, to begin with, that Zionism cannot deliver on its claim to preserve the well-being of Jewish people around the world.  It is first and foremost a state and as such will be oriented toward the interests of a domestic elite. for this insight take on James Baldwin’s (in turn) insightful comments on both Zionism – he nailed it – and Baldwin’s reminder – as if it needed saying – that overwhelmingly (there are a few who aren’t) that Jews, especially those of European Askinaze origins … are white!…
    
    The power of Baldwin’s thinking – far beyond his comments on Israel and the Palestinians – are returning to the mainstream after a long sleep.

Baldwin didn’t speak often of Israel, but he still managed to say plenty

!  A rupture facilitates interplay between colonization and capitalism:  confuse a people with the state, a formation devoted to inhuman pursuits, and the people will never live up to any kind of idealization; the state is incapable of—and uninterested in—the resolution of trauma. 

Anti-Semitic Zionists are possible because Israel benefits a chauvinistic ruling class; members of that class give zero shits about the health of the state’s inhabitants.  In fact, given the conditions of violence and accumulation in the Imperium, it’s _logical_ to dislike Jews and love Israel.  The alt-right didn’t [select Israel](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2017/11/6/zionism-and-the-alt-right)
 as a model of statecraft at random. 

Baldwin wasn’t alone in this sort of analysis.  For over a century, Palestinian thinkers, along with a plethora of decolonial voices, have similarly implicated ethnonationalism.

Israel is perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip, according to a study published on December 5 by the human rights organization Amnesty International. Due to the prolonged conflict and the limitations placed on humanitarian access, there has been a significant risk of famine in the Gaza Strip for several months.

| Fact | Detail |
| Population Growth | Since October 7, 2023, Gaza’s population has grown by 2.02%. |
| Time span | Since October 7, 2023, the population has grown, indicating growth in a short period of time. But that estimate is predicated on growth forecasts from August 2023, before Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza and Hamas’ October 7, 2023, strike. Gaza’s health ministry reported in August that since October 2023, more than 40,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza. |

CNN  — 

Gaza’s population dropped by 6% – about 160,000 people – in 2024, according to a new report, as Israel’s war against Hamas took a heavy toll on the Palestinian enclave’s demographics.

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said in a report released Tuesday that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since the beginning of the war on October 7, 2023, in addition to at least 45,553 who were killed in Israeli attacks in the strip, according to official figures by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the enclave.

The report also warned 60,000 pregnant women in Gaza were “endangered” due to the lack of adequate healthcare and 96% of the population were facing high levels of food insecurity.

Gaza’s population now stands at 2.1 million, including more than a million children under the age of 18, making up 47% of the population, PCBS’s report added.

Meanwhile, a separate report by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) found that Israel’s population was still growing – but more slowly than before – in a trend it attributed to Israelis leaving the country.

The Israeli report cautioned, however, that the full impact of Israel’s multi-front war on long-term migration pattern was yet to be seen.

In the report published Tuesday, the census office said that in 2024, Israel’s population grew by 1.1%, compared to 1.6% in 2023.

“The decrease is mainly due to the high number of Israelis emigrating from Israel in 2024,” it said, adding that last year, some 82,700 residents left Israel, compared to 55,000 the year before.

By December 31, 2024, Israel’s population was estimated at 10.027 million, the report said, topping the 10-million mark for the first time. In 2023, it was shaken by mass protests against controversial plans by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to overhaul the country’s judicial system.

It then launched a war on Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group led brutal attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 on October 7, 2023. Israel’s attacks since then have killed more than 45,000 people and injured 108,000 in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip.

Israel is also fighting against the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, which began firing at Israel on October 8, 2023, as well as conflicts with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria and Iraq who say they are attacking Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

An X account of visegrad24 made a [post](https://x.com/visegrad24/status/1858887085094056012)
 citing The World Factbook claiming that

> Gaza population increased by 2.02% or 43,000 people since October 7th 2023.

(an [archived](https://archive.md/hq9B0)
 version if the site doesn't work). It links to this [PDF](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_WPD2024E.pdf)
, which does not load for me, but the archived [version](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222175034/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/portals/_pcbs/PressRelease/Press_En_WPD2024E.pdf)
 does.

I then decided to look for another source, and I found on the [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza)

> Gaza has grown by 22,449 in the last year, which represents a 2.88% annual change.

I finally continued to a [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/gaza-population-down-by-6-since-war-began-says-pa-bureau-citing-hamas-figures/)
 article where they claim

> The population of Gaza has fallen 6 percent since the war with Israel began nearly 15 months ago as about 100,000 Palestinians left the enclave, while more than 55,000 are presumed dead, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), citing Hamas figures.

Which sources are more reliable and what can be concluded regarding if the population in Gaza since October 7th 2023 or since January 1st 2024 until December 31st 2024 has increased or decreased?

    Maybe the best conclusion is: It's a war zone, nobody did an exact census, therefore nobody knows exactly. I would have thought a skeptical question would be more like "This source from October 2024 claims that Gaza's population has increased since 2023, despite the recent events."

While reliable sources are difficult to find, due to the ongoing war, the assertion that the population of Gaza increased since the Hamas attacks against Israel and the subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza is highly implausible based on the sources available.

First, what have been the negative contributions to the population of Gaza since then?

**Deaths**: The [United Nations reported around 45,000 people killed as of December of 2024,](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-10-december-2024)
 basing its figures on data from the Gaza Ministry of Health in that same month. There were 58270 in the Gaza Strip in 2021 according to PA'sinterior ministry : [pcbs.gov.ps/…](https://pcbs.gov.ps/statisticsIndicatorsTables.aspx?lang=en&table_id=1568)
     In the first 3 months of the war, nearly 20,000 babies have been born in Gaza according to Unicef : [timesofisrael.com/liveblog\_entry/…](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/nearly-20000-babies-born-in-gaza-hell-since-oct-7-says-un-official-mum-on-israeli-baby-hostage/)
     (it might be slightly more than usual due to a higher rate of preterm births [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_Gaza_Strip_preterm_births)

The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reported on the Palestinian population in July 2024.

They [reported](https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=5791)

> 5.61 million Palestinians in the State of Palestine (2.85 million males and 2.76 million females)

They report on 39 thousand Palestinians killed, several thousand that left, and people at risk of malnutrition and lack of medical treatment.

They predict:

> Based on the data, the estimated growth rate in Gaza Strip for 2023 will decrease from about 2.7%, according to PCBS estimates for 2023, **to only about 1% during 2024**. It probably isn't even possible to conduct a census.

    The _World Population Review_ link you posted cites a _single source_ for its data, which is titled "Localities in Gaza Governorate by type of locality and population estimates - 2007-2016". Which would work well if nothing significant happened between 2016 and now … but that's obviously not the case.

*   Is this a _skeptical_ question, or just a question about Gaza's population, when there are conflicting sources? It is also reasonable to speculate that these figures are an underestimate, given the difficulty of confirming deaths and the likelihood of additional deaths due to secondary effects of the conflict, but for the sake of making a conservative estimate, we will limit ourselves to these numbers.

**Emigration**: [News reports suggest at least 100,000 Gazans sought refuge in Egypt](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20241007-a-year-of-war-in-gaza-100-000-palestinians-fled-to-egypt)
 before Israel took control of the Rafah border crossing.

What about positive contributions to the population?

**Births**: The [CIA Factbook suggests a population of around 2 million and a growth rate of around 2.13% in years before the war](https://web.archive.org/web/20210112082940/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/gaza-strip/)
. With the war making it even less popular and Israel having taken control of all crossings as of May 2024, it seems likely that essentially no one is permanently moving to Gaza.

In short, based on publicly available information, the negative contributions to the population of Gaza since the beginning of the war are likely to exceed 145,000, while the positive contributions are likely around 43,000."

**RAMALLAH, Palestine / ISTANBUL**

Gaza’s population has dropped by 10% as Israel continued its destructive war on the Palestinian enclave, official figures showed on Thursday.

“Palestine, specifically the Gaza Strip, is suffering an unprecedented humanitarian and demographic catastrophe due to the ongoing Israeli aggression since October 2023,” the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said in a statement.

The bureau said that more than 57,000 Palestinians, including 18,000 children and 12,000 women, were killed in Israeli attacks, which constitutes 2.4% of Gaza’s total population.

Figures released by the bureau also showed that nearly 100,000 Palestinians have left the enclave since the start of the Israeli war.

Before the outbreak of the Israeli war, Gaza's population stood at 2,226,544 in 2023, as official figures showed.

“Population estimates indicate that the population has declined to approximately 2,129,724, representing a 6% decrease compared to the projection of mid-2024 estimates,” it said.

“Furthermore, the population dropped to 2,114,301, a decrease of 10% from what was estimated for mid-2025.”

The bureau warned of “a fundamental shift” and distortion in the age and population pyramid “due to the deliberate targeting of younger age groups by the Israeli army, particularly children and youth.”

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Etymology
---------

This section is an excerpt from [Gaza City § Etymology](/wiki/Gaza_City#Etymology "Gaza City")
.\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaza_City&action=edit)\
\]

The name _Gaza_ first appears in military records of [Tuthmosis III](/wiki/Tuthmosis_III "Tuthmosis III")
 of [Egypt](/wiki/New_Kingdom_(Egypt) "New Kingdom (Egypt)")
 in the 15th century BC,[\[36\]](#cite_note-40)
\[_[need quotation to verify](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")\
_\] and was mentioned in the [Amarna correspondence](/wiki/Amarna_correspondence "Amarna correspondence")
 as _Āl Ĥazzati_ and other variant spellings.[\[37\]](#cite_note-41)
 In [Neo-Assyrian](/wiki/Neo-Assyrian "Neo-Assyrian")
 sources, reflecting the late [Philistine](/wiki/Philistine "Philistine")
 period, it was known as _Hāzat_.[\[38\]](#cite_note-42)
 It is clear the name originates from none of these languages, however.

Based on the city's [modern Hebrew](/wiki/Modern_Hebrew "Modern Hebrew")
 name, _ʻAzzā_, a common [folk etymology](/wiki/Folk_etymology "Folk etymology")
 insists the name stems from the Hebrew root _[ʻayin](/wiki/%CA%BBayin "ʻayin")
_\-_[zayin](/wiki/Zayin "Zayin")
_\-_zayin_, from which words related to strength and fierceness are derived,[\[39\]](#cite_note-Gaza_City_Masalha-43)
 but this is unlikely. Mobilization with UN and EU partners is ongoing to finalize a needs assessment in support of Gaza's reconstruction and recovery.[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

[Another escalation](/wiki/2022_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_clashes "2022 Gaza–Israel clashes")
 between 5 and 8 August 2022 resulted in property damage and displacement of people as a result of airstrikes.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, an article by the New York City Financial Policy Association, claims a 2.02% increase, referencing a study by Amnesty International and growth forecasts from August 2023. However, other sources, such as CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population, with the Anadolu Agency stating a 10% decrease. Skeptics.stackexchange.com also mentions a 2.02% increase and a 2.88% annual change, while The Times of Israel claims a 6% decrease.

The conflicting data makes it difficult to verify the claim. The claim is supported by one source, but contradicted by multiple other sources. The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting information.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023."

## Actions
```
web_search("Gaza population increase since October 7 2023")
web_search("Gaza population statistics October 2023")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The New York City Financial Policy Association (NYCFPA) published an article on December 19, 2024, stating that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023. The article mentions a study by Amnesty International and is based on growth forecasts from August 2023. ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) <image:5345>

CNN reports that Gaza's population dropped by 6% in 2024. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) reported that about 100,000 Palestinians had left Gaza since October 7, 2023, and at least 45,553 were killed in Israeli attacks. ([https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl)) <image:k>, <image:j>, <image:i> Skeptics.stackexchange.com discusses the population of Gaza since October 7, 2023, referencing a 2.02% increase and a 2.88% annual change. A Times of Israel article claims a 6% decrease in population since the war began. ([https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/57590/has-the-gaza-population-increased-in-2024-and-if-so-by-how-much](https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/57590/has-the-gaza-population-increased-in-2024-and-if-so-by-how-much))


### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by the Anadolu Agency on July 10, 2025, Gaza's population has decreased by 10% since the start of the Israeli war in October 2023, with the population dropping from an estimated 2,226,544 in 2023 to approximately 2,114,301. [Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261) <image:k>

Wikipedia states that the Gaza Strip has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.). [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip) <image:i>, <image:j>.


## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population change in Gaza since October 7, 2023. One source, an article by the New York City Financial Policy Association, claims a 2.02% increase, referencing a study by Amnesty International and growth forecasts from August 2023. However, other sources, such as CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population, with the Anadolu Agency stating a 10% decrease. Skeptics.stackexchange.com also mentions a 2.02% increase and a 2.88% annual change, while The Times of Israel claims a 6% decrease.

The conflicting data makes it difficult to verify the claim. The claim is supported by one source, but contradicted by multiple other sources. The claim's veracity is uncertain due to the conflicting information.


## Final Judgement
The claim is contradicted by multiple sources that report a decrease in population, while the source supporting the claim is based on growth forecasts from before the conflict. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023, is not supported by the evidence. While one source ([https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) supports the claim, other sources, including CNN and the Anadolu Agency, report a decrease in population ([https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl), [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/gaza-s-population-drops-by-10-amid-israel-s-genocidal-war/3627261)).

“Breaking: Iran’s

IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. (Photo by JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images) ©(Photo by JOE KLAMAR/AFP via Getty Images)

A post [shared on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2675716869304453&id=100005984985043)
 claims an Iranian general fled to Israel.

**Verdict: False**

There is no evidence for this claim.

**Fact Check:**

Social media users are claiming that Iranian Gen. Esmail Qaani is confirmed safe in Israel

It can now be revealed that he was an Israeli asset, providing intelligence that led to elimination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and Hezbollah leaders Nasrallah and Safieddine,” reads one user’s post.

This claim is false. No media outlets have reported that Qaani has defected to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces nor any Israeli government entity has confirmed that Qaani provided intelligence. The outlet reported that while Qaani was under investigation in connection to Nasrallah’s death, he was seen at “rallies commemorating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution” in February 2025.

The article mentions Qaani was seen at rallies in February 2025 (<image:5457>). The Jerusalem Post reported on June 30, 2025, about a post from the X account @MossadSpokesman denying rumors of ties to Esmail Qaani (<image:1>).

The Times of Israel reported that Esmail Qaani was killed in an Israeli attack, citing unnamed Iranian sources (<image:5483>).

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

The video, and screenshots from the video, were shared with similar captions across multiple platforms in March 2025.

“I’ve got zero sympathy or respect for this Zionist puppet!!” one Facebook user [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10236160829271032&set=a.1416068811808)
 while another on Bluesky [wrote](https://bsky.app/profile/paulwalker44.bsky.social/post/3ljilv7ute227)
“Libs love Zelensky. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country’s fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

A video and still images were shared online claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel in March 2025; however, the video actually shows him at a U.S. munitions factory supporting Ukraine's defense needs. The video was shared on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. The Wikipedia article discusses a meeting between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, 2025, in the Oval Office. The AP News article mentions a joint press conference between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Finland's President Alexander Stubb on March 19, 2025.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania on September 23, 2024 (<image:1958>, <image:1964>, <image:40>). The BBC published articles about the event on September 26, 2024, and the Associated Press reported on September 25, 2024, that Zelenskyy's visit included signing military ordnance.

The BBC articles can be found here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o) and [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rkv0k4j8o). The Associated Press article is available at [https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-johnson-ambassador-ukraine-biden-harris-trump-d81b0a055d99cfd4804b3f2c00915d09).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The ammunition was for Ukraine's defense needs, not for use by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing ammunition at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The ammunition was for Ukraine's defense needs, not for use by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza. The claim misrepresents the context of the image.

`false`

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, is described in the search results. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, includes a 30-foot high bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame, resting on a granite base, and a metal remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009, and commemorates the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and includes memorial plaques. The cenotaph is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)), Memorial Mapping ([http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza)), and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)). <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial includes a sculpture and a remnant from the Twin Towers. The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to search for other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)
 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

On September 11, 2002, the documentary play _[Bystander 9/11](/wiki/Bystander_9/11 "Bystander 9/11")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, is described in the search results. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, includes a 30-foot high bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame, resting on a granite base, and a metal remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial was dedicated on November 12, 2009, and commemorates the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and includes memorial plaques. The cenotaph is made of granite, bronze, and aluminum. The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)), Memorial Mapping ([http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza](http://www.memorialmapping.com/memorials/9-11-living-memorial-plaza)), and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)). <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial includes a sculpture and a remnant from the Twin Towers. The evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to search for other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Set in Harbor View Park in Bayonne, New Jersey, “To the Struggle Against World Terrorism” was a gift from the Russian government created by artist Zurab Tsereteli to honor the victims of the 1993 and 2001 attacks.

    The Municipal Art Society of New York and Creative Time’s installation of 88 searchlights—conceived by John Bennett, Gustavo Bonevardi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian Laverdiere, and Paul Myoda with lighting consultant Paul Marantz—initially ran from March 11 through April 14, 2002, to mark the six-month anniversary of the attacks. “Obviously the deceased are not going to experience any of this but it needs to carry your memories of them.”

Following the tragic events on September 11, 2001, many cities, both in the US and abroad, built memorials for the victims, survivors, and first responders."

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The geolocation data indicates that the image was most likely taken in Israel.

The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. However, the evidence indicates that the image was taken before August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.



## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)

).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

The image appeared to show a news presenter from Israel’s Channel 12 standing next to a poll graphic with a Hebrew-language question that translates as: “Do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a “terrorist”?”

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:5666>](https://komonews.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X."

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them “human animals” for thinking like that. 

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that “28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‘they should stand criminal trial.'” The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

Quds Force chief Esmail Qaani.

**By Our Correspondent**

**NEW DELHI –** Iran’s top commander being a Mossad agent as propagated through international media, including the mainstream Indian media, has subsided after the public appearance of Esmail Qaani.

The Iranian Embassy in India has strongly refuted the assertions about Qaani being a Mossad spy and labelled them as fake news.

The Embassy said in a statement: “We strongly deny the allegation that Esmail Qaani is a Mossad agent. _**Tehran Times**_ reported that this false news was followed by “_**Iran International,**_ a Persian-language outlet linked to the Zionist regime and covertly directed by Manouchehr Amir, a former director of **_Radio Israel_**.” Iran International cited an “informed source” claiming that Commander Qaani’s family also had no news regarding his whereabouts or what he was doing.

The disappearance of Esmail Qaani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) elite Quds Force, had given a new twist to the ongoing aggression of Israel against Palestine and Lebanon amid widespread speculations that he was a Mossad spy involved in the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Embassy said in a statement: “We strongly deny the allegation that Esmail Qaani is a Mossad agent. Iranian authorities have maintained that these allegations are part of a disinformation campaign to destabilize the region and tarnish the reputation of its military leadership.

In the age of visionless and negative journalism, IndiaTomorrow.net will highlight stories of hope and development. Such claims are baseless and lack any credibility.” The Embassy also highlighted that the IRGC has officially announced that Qaani is set to receive the highest military honour from Ayatollah Khamenei, dispelling rumours about any investigations or accusations against him.

Meanwhile, the **_Tehran Times_** closely linked with the Iranian government reported that Eamail Qaani was the target of a Zionist disinformation campaign amid rising regional tensions.

The false news story about Commander Qaani’s disappearance was first reported by the **_Reuters_** news agency which, the _**Tehran Times**_ claims, is known for a history of false reporting about Iran. It was followed by a story filed by the Qatari-funded **_Middle East Eye_** claiming through its independent sources that Qaani was under house arrest and was being interrogated by the Islamic Republic’s intelligence sleuths. Mossad has been given credit for Israel’s operations in which the war on Gaza has been extended beyond its borders.

Qaani, 67, who travelled to Lebanon after Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last month, was not heard for several days. Initial reports suggested that Qaani was under house arrest and was being interrogated on suspicion of being an Israeli spy.

Qaani was appointed as the head of the Quds Force after Qassem Soleimani’s assassination by the U.S. While Soleimani commanded significant respect and maintained close ties with Iran’s regional allies, Qaani has not been able to match that level of influence or authority, as noted by military analysts and those familiar with both men.

Under Qaani’s leadership, Iranian proxies like Hezbollah and Iraqi militias have faced increased pressure, particularly from Israeli forces, contrasting with the expansion of their influence under Soleimani. Qaani was born in Iran’s Mashhad town and had fought in the Iran-Iraq war."

Afghan Officials: Iran’s New Quds Chief Likely Faked Identity in 2018

Print

Afghan officials say they are investigating a visit in 2018 of the new commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, to the province of Bamiyan where he claimed to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul.

Qaani, a 61-year-old brigadier general, became the chief of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), following the U.S. Esmail Qaani was in charge of QF operations in Central Asia while \[Soleimani\] himself was busy fighting the Americans, Israel and IS in Iraq, Lebanon and Levant.”

According to Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, Iran since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 has recruited thousands of Afghans into what is known as the Fatemiyoun battalion. killing of Qassem Soleimani Friday in an airstrike.

Shortly after his appointment, Afghan media circulated pictures showing him paying an official visit to Bamiyan province in July 2018, allegedly as Iran’s deputy ambassador.

The governor of Bamiyan, Mohammad Tahir Zuhair, who appeared in one of the photos giving Qaani a local tapestry, told VOA that Qaani introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat visiting the province to reiterate Iran’s support for the local government.

“Let me emphasize again that no foreign delegation ever comes to this province without Kabul coordinating the visit. We were told by Kabul that an Iranian delegation would oversee the process of building a hospital in Bamiyan,” Zuhair told VOA.

The governor said officials in Kabul instructed the local government to provide Qaani and his team with security and logistics assistance.

“The Iranian delegation spent about 45 minutes in the hospital and then came to my office and we met. He said that they came to Bamiyan to tell the people that Iran liked to help them,” he told VOA.

At the time of his visit to Bamiyan, Qaani was serving as the deputy commander of the Quds Force under Soleimani.

**Why the visit?**

Afghan officials say that Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan, raising questions about the intentions of his visit to the predominately Shiite province in central Afghanistan.

“We are investigating the exact nature and date of his visit. At this point I can assure you that he was never the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan,” Idrees Zaman, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, said in a press conference Tuesday.

Some Afghanistan analysts like Jonathan Schroden, the director of Center for Stability and Development at Washington-based research and analysis organization CNA, are charging that Iran might have arranged for the alleged disguise to prevent the Afghan government’s monitoring.

“It is hard to say whether he was actually traveling under a false title in this case; it’s possible that Iran could have named him as a DCM, if even temporarily, in whatever travel documents he had, etc., in order to provide him official cover for his travel,” Schroden said.

He however expressed some skepticism over the alleged disguise, saying it is unlikely that Iran’s commander could hide behind a bogus identity given his high-profile status for years in Iran and the wider region.

**Recruitment**

Other experts say Qaani’s visit could be seen as an effort to mobilize Shiite people to support the Quds Force, given Iran’s previous efforts to gain influence among Shiites in Afghanistan.

Regional experts say it was Qaani’s duty to actively recruit for the Quds Force among Shia populations in Afghanistan.

Farzin Nadimi, an associate fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that one of Iran’s main targets has been to establish a foothold in the Shiite areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He added that it is generally believed that “his \[Soleimani\] deputy, Gen."

| ![cool](https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png) I honestly think Iran needs to carry a DNA test on this guy ...To be sure he is truly Iranian..was looking for this post today, wonder why he keeps showing up in my mind eyes ... There's nothing like ghosting, you either have information or you do not ...  <br>  <br>I think Nigeria should learn from Iran and have a redundant command system, Incase all the Generals are deceived into a bunker. Core personnel should avoid the limelight.. I also know telecommunications can be intercepted and cloned to look like the real person was talking no one believed me.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

Iran general’s whereabouts in question after Israeli strikes on Hezbollah
=========================================================================

This article is more than 10 months old

[Patrick Wintour](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour)
 Diplomatic editor

Conflicting reports include house arrest of Esmail Ghaani, who was in Beirut at time of Hassan Nasrallah’s killing

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/11/middle-east-crisis-live-eu-israel-iran-lebanon-blog-news-updates-hezbollah-hamas-unifil)
    

Mystery surrounded the whereabouts and health of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) commander Esmail Ghaani, amid reports that he was being investigated over how Israel managed to penetrate and crush the command structure of [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
, the Lebanese militia at the heart of the Iranian “axis of resistance”.

It is known that Ghaani, who leads the IRGC’s al-Quds force, was in Beirut at the time of the killing of Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, but Iranian authorities have insisted he is alive, and even in line for an award for valour.

The Middle East Eye news outlet claimed Ghaani had been put under house arrest and was being investigated over the failures that allowed [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to penetrate the Hezbollah network so effectively.

Over the past two months, Israel has killed several Hezbollah leaders and appears to have made a leap forward in the quality of its intelligence.

Another Arabic outlet claimed Ghaani had suffered a heart attack during questioning.

Israeli sources said the reports, regardless of their veracity, showed the degree of stress inside the IRGC over the destruction of the Hezbollah leadership in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

One source said: “This has been a mind-blowing success as a result of a decade of intelligence gathering. “Iran is not the only one that does not want a large-scale war, but everyone knows how disastrous this war is.”

Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the royal court in Riyadh, said: “The Iranians have stated: ‘If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war.’”

!Esmail Ghaani in military uniform <image:5745>

Ghaani was appointed commander of al-Quds, a branch of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in 2020. On Tuesday, Iraj Masjedi, the deputy commander of al-Quds and a former Iranian ambassador to Baghdad, told reporters that Ghaani was “in good health and is carrying out his daily duties”.

Western diplomats said it was possible that Israel was considering a campaign of assassinations of the Iranian leadership as the most escalatory end of the range of options to be used in its imminent response to Tehran’s attack last week.

The diplomats believe Joe Biden came away from a conversation on Wednesday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, still unclear how and when Israel would respond. “He has the whiff of cordite in his nostrils” said one source, of Netanyahu, adding that there was little obvious leverage to restrain him.

The three other options are a strike on Iranian military targets of an order similar to the Israeli strike in April; an attack on economic infrastructure, including oil facilities; or an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites.

The US has strongly advised Israel not to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, and it has been made clear that neither the US or the UK would provide the practical help probably needed to undertake such an attack. Israeli officials have also been advised that it would be unwise to start its response at the top end of the escalatory scale.

Western diplomats believe the Israeli strikes could start as early as next week, but others calculate that the more Netanyahu delays until closer to the US presidential election on 5 November, the more leverage Netanyahu will have over the Democrats to support any decision he takes. Senior former Israeli intelligence officials argue that an attack on Iranian oil infrastructure would work, and not lead to a big escalation in oil prices."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from India Tomorrow ([Source](https://indiatomorrow.net/2024/10/17/irans-top-commander-being-mossad-agent-subsides-after-his-public-appearance-the-iran-embassy-in-india-denies-the-rumours-about-esmail-qaani/)) discusses rumors about Esmail Qaani, including a photo of him. The Voice of America ([Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html)) also mentions Qaani and includes a photo of him.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an article titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" from Foreign Affairs. The article, and the discussion around it, centers on the claim that Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, was disguised in civilian clothing, possibly a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. <image:57> is included in the discussion. The post links to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise. The forum discussion includes various opinions and reactions to the situation. The date of the post is June 26, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

Iranian commander Esmail Qaani on Tuesday appeared in public after weeks of absence to attend the funeral ceremony for general [Abbas Nilforoushan](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-iraq-funerals-irgc-general-killed-hezbollah-chief)
, who was killed last month in [Lebanon](https://www.newarab.com/news/unifil-stay-all-lebanon-positions-despite-israel-threats)
.

Nilforoushan, a general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in an [Israeli](https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-says-iran-attack-caused-costliest-damage-7-october)
 strike on Beirut alongside Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah.

The funeral procession for the slain Iranian general began at the Imam Hossein Square in central Tehran Tuesday morning, according to a live broadcast on state television.

Qaani - who heads the Quds Force, the IRGC's foreign operations arm - had disappeared from public view and was rumoured in some media to have either been targeted in an Israeli strike on Lebanon, or be questioned under guard over Israel's killing of Nasrallah.

He appeared Tuesday at the funeral, clad in the Guards' green military uniform.

Thousands attended the funeral procession in Imam Hossein Square, many of them carrying yellow [Hezbollah](https://www.newarab.com/news/un-draft-resolution-seeks-hezbollah-disarmament-lebanon-reforms)
 banners and Iranian and Palestinian flags and chanting "Death to Israel".

[Iran's](https://www.newarab.com/news/israels-expanding-wars-pushing-iran-towards-nuclear-weapons)
 foreign ministry said Monday the Islamic republic would use "all its capacities" to bring Israel to account over the deaths.

On 1 October, Iran launched 200 missiles on Israel in retaliation for the death of Nilforoushan and Nasrallah, in its second-ever direct attack on its arch-foe.

The attack was also in retaliation for [Hamas](https://www.newarab.com/news/hamas-and-fatah-meet-egypt-unity-talks-gaza)
 chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in July while he was in Tehran to attend an inauguration ceremony for Iran's president.

Israel has vowed to retaliate for the missile attack, with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying Israel's response will be "deadly, precise, and surprising".

Iran has in recent days engaged in high-level diplomatic talks around establishing a ceasefire in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as ways to prevent the conflict from spreading across the region.

On a visit to [Baghdad](https://www.newarab.com/news/rockets-hit-near-baghdad-airport-where-us-advisors-are-stationed)
, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said that Iran was "fully prepared for a war situation", but added that "we do not want war, we want peace".

In April Tehran had fired a volley of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for a deadly strike on Iran's consulate in [Damascus](https://www.newarab.com/news/smotrich-calls-bit-bit-israeli-expansion-damascus)
, blamed on Israel.

Esmail Qaani (Photo: khamenei.ir)

The deputy commander of Iran's elite Quds Force claimed on Monday that its chief Esmail Qaani is “in good health” amid reports that he was missing in the Lebanese capital of Beirut after last week’s Israeli strike on top Hezbollah terrorist commanders who reportedly convened in a subterranean site.

“He is in good health and is carrying out his activities. Some ask us to issue a statement… there is no need for this,” Quds Force Deputy Commander Iraj Masjedi stated regarding Qaani.

The main target of the Israeli strike was Hashem Safi al-Din, a top Hezbollah official and supposedly the candidate to replace Hezbollah Sec.-Gen. It is also unclear whether Qaani attended the meeting with top Hezbollah terrorists.

A New York Times report claimed last week that Qaani was killed in the Israeli strike. On Sunday, Britain's Daily Mail reported that Qaani was “believed to have been killed.”

An unnamed Iranian official told Reuters that Qaani visited the Dahiyeh district, a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Lebanon but insisted that he did not meet Safi al-Din.

Sky News Arabia reported Lebanese sources claiming there had been no contact with Qaani since the Israeli aerial strike.

The Quds Force is a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and is a designated terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and other governments. The Quds Force has been instrumental in arming and training Tehran-loyal militants in Syria and Iraq.

Qaani became the head of the Quds Force after the United States eliminated his predecessor Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad, Iraq in January 2020.

If Qaani, indeed, perished in the Israeli strike, he would be the highest-ranking Iranian official to have been eliminated by Israel Defense Forces. Abbas Nilforushan**](https://apnews.com/article/iran-revolutionary-guard-general-dead-hezbollah-israel-airstrike-46d2133e594b9c4ce448a6b683802995)
, who was killed alongside Nasrallah last month.

From [Source](https://www.nairaland.com/8460455/commander-ghost-qaanis-great-escape): Found exact image on website with title: "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani's Great Escape?" - Foreign Affairs
Content: The search result is from Nairaland, a Nigerian forum. It discusses an article titled "From Commander To Ghost: Qaani’s Great Escape?" from Foreign Affairs. The article, and the discussion around it, centers on the claim that Esmail Qaani, commander of Iran's IRGC Quds Force, was disguised in civilian clothing, possibly a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. <image:57> is included in the discussion. The post links to an X post by @MOSSADil, which juxtaposes images of Qaani in military attire and civilian disguise. The forum discussion includes various opinions and reactions to the situation. The date of the post is June 26, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image in the claim is associated with rumors about Esmail Qaani disguising himself, possibly in a hijab, after reported Israeli airstrikes. The reverse image search confirms the image's presence in discussions about Qaani's alleged disguise. The India Tomorrow article mentions rumors about Qaani, and Getty Images has images of Qaani and veiled women. The Nairaland forum post links to an article discussing Qaani's disguise.

The evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image as Qaani in disguise. However, it does show that the image is used in discussions and articles that suggest this possibility.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is indeed Esmail Qaani and whether the disguise was intentional.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

TEL AVIV — Powerful Israeli airstrikes killed 90 Palestinians and wounded 300 Saturday in southern Gaza, officials said. Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said he authorized the strike against the head of the Hamas military wing, [Mohammed Deif,](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel)
 but acknowledged the fate of the militant leader was not immediately clear.

The Israelis bombed the city of Khan Younis and the nearby costal area of al-Muwasi, which has been designated a humanitarian safe zone by the Israeli military. This was the latest — and one of the deadliest — in a series of ongoing Israeli air operations directed at Hamas, but which have also inflicted heavy civilian casualties.

[!What to know about the elusive Hamas military commander behind the attack on Israel <image:5799>](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/13/1205448988/hamas-military-mohammed-deif-gaza-israel)

Shortly after the strike, reports began circulating that the attack was aimed at Deif, a shadowy figure who has led the military arm of Hamas for more than two decades and has survived multiple Israeli attempts to kill him.

In a briefing, an Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack targeted Deif, as well as another senior Hamas commander, Rafah Salameh. He did not provide additional details.

Hamas said in a statement that Israel was making "false claims merely to cover up the extent of the horrific massacre." The statement did not mention Deif.

The two top Hamas figures in Gaza are [Yahya Sinwar](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/27/1215477151/who-is-yahya-sinwar)
, the group's political leader in the territory, and Deif, who runs the military wing, the al-Qassam Brigades.

Israel says these are the two Hamas leaders most responsible for orchestrating the Oct. His wife and two of the couple's small children were killed in a 2014 airstrike intended for Deif in Gaza.

His nom de guerre "Deif" means "[guest](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57253521)

!People search the rubble of a collapsed building in the aftermath of an Israeli attack at UNRWA’s Al-Jaouni school in al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on July 6. A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages.

CNN  — 

An [Israeli](https://www.cnn.com/world/middleeast/israel)
 attack has killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured 50 others at UNRWA’s Al-Jaouni school sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday.

CNN cannot independently verify the ministry’s numbers.

A displaced man at the school told CNN children were among the injured.

“There was a swing here, swings were here, (children) were playing. “We barely found this place in the school, but even the school is not safe.”

CNN video shows several injured children arriving at a nearby hospital following the attack.

The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday militants were operating in structures located in the school area.

“This location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out,” the statement added.

CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military’s claim.

UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA’s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7.

“At least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,” she added.

The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it “condemned in the strongest terms” the attack on the UNRWA building, which it said “houses thousands of displaced civilians.”

Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the strike and what it called Israel’s “clear disregard for the rules of international law,” saying that humanitarian facilities and shelters must be protected under international law.

The news comes just as it appeared some progress was being made in long-stalled hostage release and truce negotiations. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv’s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza.

Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including “lighting bonfires on the road.”

The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest.

Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway.

“After most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,” the police said.

“During the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.”

The Israeli police further warned that it “will act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen’s instructions.”

The chairman of Israel’s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages.

The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

 have showed strong signs of support, posting statements from the leagues’ official accounts to condemn terrorism and mourn the loss of lives in Israel.

Former New York Knicks star Amar’e Stoudemire — who converted to Judaism and is an Israeli-American citizen — [posted a video on Instagram](https://twitter.com/TheDunkCentral/status/1711152518045008120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1711152518045008120%7Ctwgr%5E4c100637d6e5161037d549d6c23fa66d3555bc1b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2023%2F10%2F09%2Famare-stoudemire-rips-politicians-blm-over-israel-silence%2F)
 to denounce those are staying silent amid Hamas’ attacks on Jews.

“I woke up, man, this morning with some disturbing news out of Israel — that Hamas kidnapping children, putting them in cages, killing women, killing the elderly. I pray that all involved are able to find a resolution.”)

The major talent agencies in Hollywood — UTA, CAA and WME — have all taken public stances to stand with Israel and to support Jews.

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)
 to organizations funding relief in Israel and Palestine.

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

Britain’s King Charles condemned the “barbaric acts of terrorism,” via a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace.

A spokesperson for Prince William and Kate Middleton commented: “The Prince and Princess of Wales are profoundly distressed by the devastating events that have unfolded in the past days."
