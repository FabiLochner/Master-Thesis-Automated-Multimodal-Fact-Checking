Justification: The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like NPR and Al Jazeera, Benjamin Netanyahu was in Israel at the time, responding to the attack and convening the Security Cabinet in Jerusalem. There is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland.

So, the overall veracity is: false
