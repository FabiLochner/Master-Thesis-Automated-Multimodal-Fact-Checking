### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel published an article on August 20, 2025, about a charter flight carrying new immigrants to Israel, with an 80% spike in aliyah inquiries following the October 7 attacks in 2023.

The Arkansas Advocate also reported on October 13, 2023, that the U.S. was stressing support for Israel, with the first State Department charter flight out of Israel en route to a European destination.

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans and arranging flights for Americans to leave Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict. ([U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-10-03/us-arranges-flights-to-bring-americans-out-of-lebanon-as-others-seek-escape), [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel)). In October 2023, the U.S. State Department arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel due to reduced commercial flights ([Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/)).

The evidence confirms the U.S. government's actions regarding both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime" is not directly supported by the provided evidence. The evidence only mentions flights for U.S. citizens.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. The U.S. government is assisting Americans in both Lebanon and Israel. However, the claim about flying Israeli citizens is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially true. The U.S. government is offering loans and arranging flights for Americans to leave Lebanon in October 2024. Also, the U.S. arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel in October 2023. However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is providing emergency loans and arranging flights for Americans to leave Lebanon in October 2024 due to escalating conflict, as reported by [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2024-10-03/us-arranges-flights-to-bring-americans-out-of-lebanon-as-others-seek-escape), [Texas Standard](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/), and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel). Additionally, in October 2023, the U.S. arranged charter flights for U.S. citizens out of Israel ([Missouri Independent](https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/13/with-violence-raging-in-israel-u-s-citizens-to-be-flown-out-on-charters/)). However, the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the provided evidence.
