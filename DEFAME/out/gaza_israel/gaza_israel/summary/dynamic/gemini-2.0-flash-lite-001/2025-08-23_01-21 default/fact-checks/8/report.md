## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 8](media/8.jpg))
web_search("Israel attacks Iranian military targets October 26 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim (![image 8](media/8.jpg)) appears on multiple websites. One source, "[Islamic State" (ISIS) cell reportedly attacked ... - Syria Live Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2025/18-july-13-islamic-state-isis-cell-reportedly-attacked-syrian)", uses the image to illustrate reports from July 18, 2025, about the conflict in Syria, including an attack by an "Islamic State" (ISIS) cell. Another source, "[News Live - Oregon](https://oregon.liveuamap.com/en/2025/17-july-police-investigating-an-assault-at-the-convention-center-max)", describes the image as a picture of a raid that targeted the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024 (![image 648](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873818-669516.jpg)). The image also appears in an article from "[Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/)" (![image 649](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873823-228030.jpg)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the Israeli strikes on Iran, Iraq, and Syria on October 26, 2024, codenamed Operation Days of Repentance, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. The strikes targeted military sites, including air-defense batteries, a UAV factory, and missile production facilities. The articles mention explosions in Tehran and other cities. The sources include images of the aftermath and discuss the involvement of the US and other countries in urging restraint and de-escalation.

The sources are: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Israeli_strikes_on_Iran), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran), and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24). ![image 8](media/8.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim states that the image shows Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The reverse image search reveals that the image has been used in multiple contexts, including reports about the conflict in Syria in 2025 and a raid on October 22, 2024. The web search confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. The web search confirms the date and the nature of the attacks. However, the reverse image search indicates that the image's origin and context are uncertain.

Therefore, I cannot definitively verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm that the image specifically depicts the October 26, 2024, attacks.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of the IDF strikes around Tehran on October 26, 2024 (![image 4908](media/2025-08-23_01-22-1755912172-613451.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image search provides a map from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) showing the locations of the IDF strikes around Tehran on October 26, 2024. This supports the claim that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on that date. However, the image search does not provide any images of explosions.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true. The web search and the image search confirm the date and the nature of the attacks.


## Final Judgement
The claim is likely true, as the web search and image search confirm the date and the nature of the attacks. However, the reverse image search indicates that the image's origin and context are uncertain. The image search does not provide any images of explosions. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is likely true. While the reverse image search reveals the image has been used in different contexts, the web search confirms that Israel launched strikes on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, and the image search provides a map of the strike locations.
