## Claim
Claim: "![image 6](media/5.jpg) This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 6](media/5.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares was found in multiple sources. One source, The Times of Israel, published an article on March 25, 2019, stating that a Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell attempted to down an Israeli military helicopter during fighting in Gaza earlier that month. The article also includes an image of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip. Another source, Arab News PK, also used the image in an article titled "Gaza under fire: Israeli jets strike Hamas targets after Tel Aviv attack" and was updated on March 26, 2019.

PesaCheck published an article on December 3, 2024, with the image and a section titled "MISSING CONTEXT: This image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon".


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image depicts an Israeli helicopter deploying flares, not being shot down. The image was used in articles from 2019, and PesaCheck explicitly states that the image does not show an Israeli helicopter shot down in Southern Lebanon.

The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image shows an Israeli helicopter deploying flares, not being shot down by Hezbollah. The image was used in articles from 2019, and PesaCheck explicitly states that the image does not show an Israeli helicopter shot down in Southern Lebanon.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts an Israeli helicopter deploying flares, not being shot down. The image was used in articles from 2019, and PesaCheck explicitly states that the image does not show an Israeli helicopter shot down in Southern Lebanon.
