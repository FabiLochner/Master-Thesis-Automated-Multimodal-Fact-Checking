Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu he wants the war in Gaza to end before he returns to office if he wins the election.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/netanyahu-denies-report-he-spoke-trump-about-gaza-talks-2024-08-15/): 
Content: Reuters reports that Donald Trump, on August 15, 2024, criticized calls for a ceasefire in Gaza by Biden and Harris.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o): 
Content: The BBC reports that on July 26, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Trump criticized Kamala Harris's comments on the Israel-Gaza conflict as "disrespectful." Netanyahu stated that Israel would send negotiators to Rome for ceasefire talks. The article does not mention a phone call on August 14, 2024, or Trump telling Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there was a phone call between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a Gaza ceasefire, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the report that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248).
