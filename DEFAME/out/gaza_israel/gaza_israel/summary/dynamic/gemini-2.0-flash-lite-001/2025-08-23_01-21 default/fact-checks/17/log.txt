Content: VOA News reports that on July 10, 2024, Houthi militants fired on a U.S.-flagged container ship in the Arabian Sea. The captain of the Maersk Sentosa reported an explosion near the vessel off the coast of Nishtun, Yemen. A spokesperson for the group took responsibility for the attack on the Maersk Sentosa, as well as attacks on two other vessels traveling through the Gulf of Aden. The Maersk Sentosa and its crew were safe. <image:4932>

The claim 'A US-flagged vessel has been attacked in the Guld of Aden in July 2024. A Spokesperson at Denmark's shipping company Maersk said: 'There was an attack targeted on one of the company's US-flagged vessels at the northernmost part of the Gulf of Aden.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. Multiple sources, including Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/)) and VOA News ([https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-on-u-s--flagged-container-ship-sailing-through-arabian-sea/7692113.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-fire-on-u-s--flagged-container-ship-sailing-through-arabian-sea/7692113.html)), confirm that a U.S.-flagged vessel was attacked in July 2024. However, the attack occurred in the Arabian Sea, not the Gulf of Aden, and the claim mentions a Maersk spokesperson, which is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
