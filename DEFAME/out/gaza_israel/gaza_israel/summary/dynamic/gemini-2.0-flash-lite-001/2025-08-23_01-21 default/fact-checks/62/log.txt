Useful result: From [Source](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/left-parties-march-for-palestine-in-kolkata-stopped-by-police/article68336303.ece): 
Content: The Hindu published an article on June 26, 2024, about a protest march in Kolkata in support of Palestine. <image:0> The march was organized by left parties and was stopped by the Kolkata Police. The protesters condemned the police action and accused the Chief Minister of being a supporter of Israel.

The claim '<image:37> This image shows thousands gathering at Sohrawardi Park in Kolkata, India, in April 2025 to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The images depict a "March for Gaza" protest held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 12, 2025, not in Kolkata, India, as falsely stated in the claim. This is supported by multiple sources, including [Factly.in](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/), which confirm the misidentification of the protest's location.

So, the overall veracity is: false
