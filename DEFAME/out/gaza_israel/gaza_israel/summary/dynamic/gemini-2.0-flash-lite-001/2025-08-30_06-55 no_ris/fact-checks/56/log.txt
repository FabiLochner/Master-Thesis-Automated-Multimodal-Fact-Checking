Content: India Today reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by Hezbollah devices. The article includes images of damaged walkie-talkies. <image:10470>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-no-iphones-solar-panels-laptops-exploded-in-lebanon/a-70281061): 
Content: DW.com published a fact-check stating that no iPhones exploded in Lebanon in September 2024. The fact-check is marked as "False". The article also mentions that the claim was about sabotaged solar panels causing electrical fires in Lebanon. <image:10471>

The claim '<image:31> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While explosions occurred in Lebanon in September 2024, and iPhones can explode, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the specific attacks. A fact-check from [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/) explicitly labels the claim as false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
