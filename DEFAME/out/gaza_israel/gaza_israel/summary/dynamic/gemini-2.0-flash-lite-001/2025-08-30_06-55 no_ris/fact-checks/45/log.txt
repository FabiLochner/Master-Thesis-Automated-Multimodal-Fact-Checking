Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on June 10, 2025, reporting that Greta Thunberg accused Israel of kidnapping her and other activists. The activists were attempting to bring aid to Gaza.

The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments, including saying "And f--- Israel!" in December 2024, and being deported from Israel in June 2025, there is no evidence to support the specific image of her holding a sign that says "Fuck Israel."

So, the overall veracity is: false
