Content: "<image:10439>!AFP People and first responders gather at the scene of a reported device explosion in Sidon, in southern Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10441>AFP

Explosions were reported in southern Lebanon, including the city of Sidon, as well as Beirut's southern suburbs and the Bekaa Valley

At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country’s health ministry says.

Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds.

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members’ pagers exploded on Tuesday. <image:10439>!Reuters Mourners carry the coffin of Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar, son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar, during his funeral in Beirut, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10443>Reuters

Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people killed by exploding pagers on Tuesday, who included Hezbollah fighter Mohammed Ammar

Wednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel.

Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group.

Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister.

A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT).

There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well.

[One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast](https://x.com/lbci_news/status/1836419137385492606)
 during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds.

The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital’s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.

The health ministry said the deadly explosions "targeted walkie-talkies". <image:10439>!Getty Images Remains of an ICOM walkie talkie following an explosion at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek, in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (18 September 2024) <image:10445>Getty Images

An ICOM-branded walkie talkie was destroyed by a blast at a house on the outskirts of Baalbek

Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought.

[The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/18/israel-detonates-hezbollah-walkie-talkies-second-wave-after-pager-attack)
 before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group’s war-time emergency communications system.

The BBC asked ICOM's UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the company's press office in Japan.

Second wave of Lebanon device explosions kills 20 and wounds 450

! Israel has not commented.

The attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a "new phase in the war" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north.

UN Secretary General António Guterres warned of the “serious risk of a dramatic escalation” and called on all parties to “exercise maximum restraint”.

"Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation," he told reporters.

[How the Hezbollah exploding device attacks unfolded\
---------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/cy80nwggdz8o)

There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Hours after Wednesday’s explosions, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country “securely to their homes”.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was “opening a new phase in the war” and that the “centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces”.

An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed.

Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends.

An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech.

Hezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions.

It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions.

The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries.

It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.

! A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up.

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley.

It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM.

NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous," Dr Elias Warrak said.

"Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.”

UN appeals for restraint after further devices explode across Lebanon
=====================================================================

18 September 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for an end to the escalation in violence in the Middle East amid reports of a fresh wave of electronic device detonations in Lebanon which caused further deaths and injuries. 

International media reported that walkie-talkies used by members of the Hezbollah militant group blew up on Wednesday, a day after hundreds of pagers across the country exploded simultaneously.

Mr. Guterres was deeply alarmed by reports that a large number of communication devices exploded in Lebanon and Syria over the past two days, his Spokesperson said in [a statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-09-18/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-lebanon)
.

At least 11 people were killed, including children – and thousands more injured.

**Stop the fighting, restore stability**
----------------------------------------

“The Secretary-General urges all concerned actors to exercise maximum restraint to avert any further escalation,” the statement said.

Tweet URL

> [](https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/statuses/1836414396014223796)

He also called for the parties to recommit to the full implementation of UN [Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)](https://undocs.org/Home/Mobile?FinalSymbol=S%2FRes%2F1701(2006)&Language=E&DeviceType=Desktop&LangRequested=False)
 and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities to restore stability.

Adopted in August 2006, the resolution aimed at ending the war that erupted that year between Israel and Hezbollah, on Lebanese soil.  It calls for an end to hostilities, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone.

The statement concluded by saying **the UN “supports all diplomatic and political efforts to end the violence that threatens to engulf the region.”**

**De-escalation ‘more crucial than ever’: UN rights chief**
-----------------------------------------------------------

The device detonations are occurring against the backdrop of the war in Gaza and attacks last year in Lebanon, the Syrian Golan Heights and Iran, linked to the conflict.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, also issued [a statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2024/09/comment-un-high-commissioner-human-rights-volker-turk-explosions-across-lebanon)
 deploring the widespread simultaneous explosions and stressing the need for de-escalation.

“At this extremely volatile time, I appeal to all States with influence in the region and beyond to take immediate measures to avert further widening of the current conflicts - enough of the daily horrors, enough of the suffering,” he said.

“It is high time leaders stepped up in defence of the rights of all people to live in peace and security. Turk said “simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, **without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law** and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law.”

 He called for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation and for those who ordered and carried out the attacks to be held to account.

The UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon also warned against the danger of escalation.

"Pained by casualties inflicted today due to more explosions of devices, I can only reiterate my appeal for restraint. Further escalatory actions risk devastating consequences," Jeanine Hennis-Plaschaert wrote in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

The envoy also acknowledged the efforts of medical teams "working under enormous stress to save lives and treat the wounded."

“Well, it Depends”: The Explosive Pagers Attack Revisited
=========================================================

On 17 September, 2024, thousands of pagers distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives in Lebanon and Syria exploded. While no State acknowledged responsibility for these explosions, [media reports](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
 have strongly suggested that Israel is responsible for them.

[_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html)
 and [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/)
 reporting suggests the following sequence of events. We note in this regard that between 8 October 2023 and 17 September 2024, [Hezbollah fired](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4893654-hezbollah-has-fired-more-than-8000-rockets-toward-israel-since-october-7-ambassador/)
 more than 8,000 rockets towards Israel, [reaching a peak](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/war-data/)
 of 1,300 rockets in the month of August alone. The fact that the Israeli major counter-attack was undertaken almost a year after Hezbollah’s attacks started, following a series of failed attempts to end Hezbollah’s use of force through resorting to more [measured military responses](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-military-says-2024-08-25/)
 and [diplomatic means](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2475451)
, appears to us to clearly meet the _jus ad bellum_ test of necessity.

In the same vein, the [argument](https://x.com/BCFinucane/status/1840416147360854526)
 that Israel was legally required to accept a ceasefire deal in Gaza—on terms which it considers [unacceptable](https://news.sky.com/story/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-rejects-ceasefire-deal-that-would-leave-hamas-intact-13129727)
 to it (i.e., which would leave Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip)—in order to stop Hezbollah’s rocket attacks, and that its failure to do so implies lack of military necessity, appears to us to be baseless. It has also been reported that the explosive charges installed in the pagers were relatively [small](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
, leading mostly to injuries and not deaths. In February 2024, Hezbollah decided to go “low tech” in order to evade Israel’s monitoring.

Anticipating this, Israel formed a shell corporation in Hungary called B.A.C. The actual explosion occurred shortly afterwards either by pager holders pressing two buttons manually with both of their hands to view the encrypted message or through a second activating message.

On 17 September, the detonation order was given and thousands of pagers exploded. Twelve persons were reportedly killed by the explosions (two of them children, most likely of Hezbollah operatives). On 18 September, a second set of explosions took place resulting in more casualties. This time the attacks were focused on walkie-talkies, which were probably in use by Hezbollah for a longer period of time (perhaps from as early as 2015).

While there appears to be broad appreciation among military experts of the sophistication of Israel’s intelligence services and the technical prowess they demonstrated in the pager attack, professional debates regarding the legality of the attack reveal deep disagreements (see e.g., [here](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/exploding-pagers-law/)
, [here](https://www.ejiltalk.org/were-the-israeli-pager-and-walkie-talkie-attacks-on-hezbollah-indiscriminate/)
 and [here](https://verfassungsblog.de/was-sagt-das-volkerrecht-zu-den-pager-und-walkie-talkie-explosionen/)
)."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486)) reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible.

The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options

In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, but it does not directly link the image of the exploded iPhone to those specific attacks. While there are reports of iPhones exploding, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks. Therefore, the claim is not verifiable. `not enough information`

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486)) reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible. The explosions resulted in casualties, with reports indicating the use of relatively small explosive charges. The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.
<image:10441>, <image:10443>, <image:10445>, <image:1>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

The evidence continues to show that iPhones can explode, but there is still no direct link between the image in the claim and the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon. The new images show different examples of exploded iPhones, but none of them are connected to the specific event described in the claim.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence connecting the image to the described event.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9jglrnmkvo)) and UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154486)) reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in deaths and injuries. The BBC article mentions that the attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister announced a "new phase in the war". The UN article mentions simultaneous explosions of pagers across the country.

The Lieber Institute at West Point ([https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/well-it-depends-explosive-pagers-attack-revisited/)) discusses the September 17, 2024, Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting Israel was responsible. The explosions resulted in casualties, with reports indicating the use of relatively small explosive charges. The article also mentions a second set of explosions on September 18, targeting walkie-talkies.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Apple Support Communities website contains an image of a damaged iPhone (<image:10455>). The Free Press Journal reports on an iPhone 13 exploding in a youth's pocket, causing burn injuries (<image:10456>).

AppleInsider published an article about an iPhone X that exploded after updating to iOS 12.1 (<image:10457>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, targeting wireless communication devices, including walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah. These explosions resulted in casualties. The image search reveals examples of exploded iPhones. However, there is no direct evidence linking the specific image in the claim to the September 2024 attacks or confirming that the explosions caused by the attacks involved iPhones.

The claim's assertion that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024 cannot be verified with the available evidence.

More information is needed to confirm the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
India Today reported on an iPhone XS Max exploding in a pocket, causing injuries (<image:10466>). Digit.in shows an image of an exploded iPhone (<image:10467>). iDrop News contains images of an exploded iPhone XS Max (<image:10468>).


## Elaboration
The evidence continues to show that iPhones can explode, but there is still no direct link between the image in the claim and the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon. The new images show different examples of exploded iPhones, but none of them are connected to the specific event described in the claim.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence connecting the image to the described event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
ITC.ua shows an image of an exploded iPhone, along with other devices, that exploded in Lebanon, without specifying the date of the event (<image:10469>). India Today reported on explosions in Lebanon on September 18, 2024, caused by Hezbollah devices, including images of damaged walkie-talkies (<image:10470>). DW.com published a fact-check stating that no iPhones exploded in Lebanon in September 2024, marking the claim as "False" (<image:10471>).


## Elaboration
The evidence now includes a fact-check from DW.com, which explicitly labels the claim as "False." This directly contradicts the claim that the image shows an iPhone that exploded during the September 2024 attacks in Lebanon.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while explosions did occur in Lebanon in September 2024, and iPhones can explode, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the specific attacks. A fact-check from DW.com explicitly labels the claim as false. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While explosions occurred in Lebanon in September 2024, and iPhones can explode, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts an iPhone that exploded during the specific attacks. A fact-check from [DW.com](https://www.dw.com/) explicitly labels the claim as false.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

At least four people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night.

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)
” near the hospital.

• Israel’s military also alleged a Hezbollah bunker is located under another Beirut hospital, but Sahel General [officials insisted the claims were “baseless”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jli6i900073b6no3zf6934)
 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

• Meanwhile, the UN warned [almost no aid is entering the Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlkf8w000h3b6ntv25t5iw)

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

The last time Israel invaded southern Lebanon and engaged in ground combat with Hezbollah was during the month-long [2006 Lebanon War](/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War")
.[\[93\]](#cite_note-apnews20240930-99)

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[94\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-100)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[95\]](#cite_note-aj-101)
 which quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges impacting areas in or around [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
 of [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
.[\[96\]](#cite_note-102)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[88\]](#cite_note-foreignaffairs20240923-94)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
.[\[97\]](#cite_note-Hezbollah_warns-103)

 From 8 October 2023 to 20 September 2024, Hezbollah has launched 1,900 cross border attacks, and Israel has launched another 8,300.[\[99\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20240925-105)
 The fighting killed 564 in Lebanon (including 133 civilians),[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon,[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[101\]](#cite_note-107)

Israel requested that Hezbollah implement [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701")
 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")
.[\[102\]](#cite_note-UNSCcondemn-108)
[\[103\]](#cite_note-109)

 and has repeatedly breached Lebanese airspace, waters, and borders.[\[110\]](#cite_note-116)
[\[111\]](#cite_note-117)
[\[112\]](#cite_note-118)
 UNIFIL reports that Israel entered Lebanese airspace on more than 22,000 occasions between 2007 and 2021.[\[113\]](#cite_note-119)
[\[114\]](#cite_note-120)
 Diplomatic efforts, led by U.S. The IDF said that they were distributed without senior authorisation and that the incident was being investigated.[\[117\]](#cite_note-123)

On 17 and 18 September, thousands of Hezbollah's handheld [pagers and walkie-talkies exploded](/wiki/2024_Lebanon_electronic_device_attacks "2024 Lebanon electronic device attacks")

 The explosions killed 42 people and injured at least 3,500, including civilians.[\[119\]](#cite_note-125)
[\[120\]](#cite_note-NWS_1-126)
[\[121\]](#cite_note-ABCN_1-127)
 Reuters reported that, according to an unnamed Hezbollah official, 1,500 Hezbollah fighters were taken out of action due to injuries, with many blinded or having lost their hands.[\[122\]](#cite_note-128)
 Despite Israel denying involvement with the attack,[\[123\]](#cite_note-denial-129)
 unnamed Israeli sources told Reuters and other media that it was orchestrated by Israel's intelligence service ([Mossad](/wiki/Mossad "Mossad")
) and military.[\[124\]](#cite_note-130)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-nyt-fbs-trojan-24-131)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-124)
 In response, Hezbollah, who described the attack as a possible [declaration of war](/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war")
 by Israel, launched a rocket attack on northern Israel a few days later.[\[126\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-132)
[\[127\]](#cite_note-133)

[\[129\]](#cite_note-135)

People in southern Lebanon and Beirut received mobile phone calls and messages that told them to relocate.[\[130\]](#cite_note-136)
 IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a video address, "We advise civilians from Lebanese villages located in and next to buildings and areas used by Hezbollah for military purposes, such as those used to store weapons, to immediately evacuate for their own safety".[\[131\]](#cite_note-137)

 said they found Hezbollah plans to launch an attack similar to Hamas' [7 October attacks](/wiki/October_7_attacks "October 7 attacks")
, which sparked the conflict.[\[85\]](#cite_note-reuters20240930-91)
 Hagari also mentioned that evidence from these operations, including videos and maps, would be presented to the international community. Two hours later, the IDF fired rounds into the camp that caused smoke to rise, injuring 15 UNIFIL peacekeepers due to skin irritations and [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract")
 reactions.[\[73\]](#cite_note-bbc20241013-78)

Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon hit branches of Hezbollah-linked bank

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

Content: "Out of 135,000 tents, 110,000 are completely worn out and urgently need replacement,” it said.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said many tent sites are near the coast and are not designed to withstand “these horrific conditions”, especially as colder weather approaches.

“The rising tide has damaged many of these tents, leaving people with little hope and no dry clothes to protect themselves,” he said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has warned that half a million people across the besieged enclave are at risk in areas hit by flooding.

“The situation will only get worse with every drop of rain, every bomb, every strike,” the agency said on X.

Meanwhile on Monday, Israeli attacks intensified across the enclave.

In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, an Israeli air attack killed at least four people, medics said, while tanks deepened their incursions in Beit Hanoon, Beit Lahiya, and Jabalia – the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps.

Medics said seven Palestinian people were also killed by two Israeli air attacks in Jabalia.

Residents in Gaza said Israeli planes also dropped new leaflets on Beit Lahiya ordering remaining residents to leave the northern city for the south, saying the area would come under attack and providing them with a map.

Palestinian people say Israel appears determined to depopulate the area permanently to create a buffer zone along the northern edge of Gaza. Our clothes got wet and we have nothing to protect ourselves, just the tent,” said Um Mohammad Marouf, a displaced Beit Lahiya resident.

Many [tents](/gallery/2024/11/25/heavy-rains-flood-tents-in-gaza-bringing-further-misery-to-palestinians)
 used in the early stages of Israel’s war in Gaza have now worn out and no longer offer protection. ![Gaza flood](/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-25T110219Z_849263743_RC2ACBA5QWAT_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1732533672.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Heavy rains have flooded tent encampments of displaced Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, adding misery to communities already devastated by 13 months of war, as Israeli forces stepped up attacks in the enclave.

Downpours overnight inundated tents and in some places [washed away](/gallery/2024/11/25/heavy-rains-flood-tents-in-gaza-bringing-further-misery-to-palestinians)

Some placed water buckets on the ground to protect mats from leaks and dug trenches to drain water away from their tents.

“We left the north and survived the bombings. I’ve been sick for three days,” Ahmad, a displaced resident of Jabalia, northern Gaza, told Al Jazeera in a tent camp in Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City.

“We were affected by the rain. The price of new tents and plastic sheeting has also shot up beyond the means of displaced families.

On Monday, Gaza’s Government Media Office said in a statement that about 10,000 tents were either washed away or damaged due to the storm, appealing for international help to provide displaced families with tents to shield them against the rain and cold.

“According to government field assessment teams, 81 percent of the displaced persons’ tents are no longer usable. Israel has repeatedly denied this accusation.

Israel’s war in Gaza has killed at least 44,235 Palestinians and wounded 104,638 since October 7, 2023.

An estimated 1,139 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas-led attacks that day and more than 200 were taken captive.

Content: "Surely, even axiomatically, if there is any way we can survive inside the tank of a warming world and get out of it alive, it is by learning to fight – not to die – and to nourish some climate _sumud_ along these lines.

In Palestine, the real calamity would be consummated the day when there are no more muffled sounds detected from tunnels being dug under the border between Gaza and 1948, no more rockets groomed for a flight over it, no more stones smashing into settler cars, no more colony fences breached, no more tyres set alight and rolled towards wall towers, no more prisoners taken to emergency rooms after more than a month of hunger strike, no more marches to the orchards after Friday prayers, no more protesters tying themselves to olive trees, no more slingshots passed on between _shabab_ and _banat_ wrapped in _kouffiyehs_: and that day, thankfully, still looks very distant.

To those who – saturated with hypocritical moralism, an ethical smugness only the victors can afford – demand that we condemn the resistance, one should respond: what do you want the Palestinians to do?

The Walls of the Tank: On Palestinian Resistance
================================================

by [Andreas Malm](https://salvage.zone/author/andreasmalm/ "Posts by Andreas Malm")
 | May 1, 2017

! In what is probably the most famous scene in Palestinian fiction, they hide inside an empty water-tank and, while their smuggler is holed up at the border, succumb to the unbearable heat. When the smuggler finds their bodies, he cries out, in a scream echoing through generations of Palestinian resistance culture: ‘Why didn’t you knock on the sides of the tank? Why didn’t you bang the sides of the tank?’

Neither of these two canonical Palestinian writers, nor anyone else writing in Arabic, has come close to the global bestseller status of Susan Abulhawa. In _A Balcony over the Fakihani_, Liyana Badr describes one of these eternal recurrences, in Beirut in 1982, but her words could fit any of the others:

> I saw piles of concrete, stones, torn clothes scattered about, shattered glass, little pieces of cotton wool, fragments of metal, buildings destroyed or leaning crazily (…) White dust smothered the district, and through the gray of the smoke loomed the gutted shells of blocks and the debris of houses razed to the earth. Inside the tank is where they try to survive.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

If these descriptions of the fate of Palestine are the products of writers’ imagination, we now possess a sumptuous collection of photographs providing more hands-on evidence. Farmers crop wheat below the walls of Jerusalem, coppersmiths bang on lids, stone-cutters show their picks and axes, a merchant walks imperiously one step ahead of a man in ragged clothes carrying his burden on his back. One sweltering hot week in the summer of 2007, I stood with the great-grandchildren of that generation at the perimeters of the camp – by then a veritable city – and watched as the tanks of the Lebanese army reduced Nahr el-Bared to a pile of smouldering debris.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

What is the relationship between Palestine and the rest of the world? There remains to be written a history of the fossil economy in Palestine, from the first encounter with the power of steam in Akka, to the decline in precipitation, the drying-out, the rise of the sea, the salt-water intrusion, the storms.

![](http://salvage.zone/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/hammersickle_glyph.png)

Palestine provides a human vantage point for seeing the truth about capitalist modernity known to most non-human life forms."

Content: "It appears that the victim was purposefully stripped of his clothes, as he was seen wearing only his underpants at the time of his death.

The ramming operation occurred before the Israeli army withdrew to the outskirts of the Zaytoun neighbourhood two days ago, as evidenced by the condition of the entrails and other body parts, which had not yet decomposed when the case was documented.

Another documented incident took place on 23 January, when an Israeli tank ran over members of the Ghannam family while they were sleeping in a shelter caravan in the Taiba Towers area of Khan Younis. A female civilian said that she was shocked by the tank suddenly running over her tent.

In addition, Euro-Med Monitor has documented numerous incidents of Israeli army tanks destroying civilian property, particularly cars, during Israel’s ground incursions into different parts of the Gaza Strip. Most of these tank attacks have targeted vehicles parked in the streets without any military affiliation, indicating the Israeli army’s deliberate and systematic destruction of Palestinian property.

Euro-Med Monitor affirmed that all of these violations are part of a larger Israeli effort to dehumanise every Palestinian in the Gaza Strip, in order to justifiy and normalise the crimes being committed against them. Crushing civilians with tanks is just one of the many cruel ways the Israeli army murders Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, disregarding their humanity, suffering, and dignity.

Palestinian territory- The Israeli army’s repeated killings of Palestinian civilians by deliberately running them over alive with military vehicles was vehemently denounced by Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Sunday, as was the widespread destruction of civilian property. These crimes are part of Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the rights group said, ongoing since 7 October 2023.

Euro-Med Monitor documented the Israeli army’s killing of a Palestinian man who was deliberately run over in Gaza City’s Al-Zaytoun neighbourhood on 29 February after he was arrested. To guarantee thorough and complete crushing, the victim was placed on asphalt rather than in an adjacent sandy area.

The victim’s mutilated body and the surrounding area bear obvious signs that a military bulldozer or tank was present. Amina, his 13-year-old daughter, confirmed that her father and older sister were killed when an Israeli tank unexpectedly and repeatedly ran over the caravan, where the family had been sleeping. While her mother and two other siblings survived the attack, Amina experienced extreme pressure in her eyes, nearly losing her sight.

Euro-Med Monitor also documented Israeli tanks and bulldozers running over and crushing displaced people inside their tents in Beit Lahia’s Kamal Adwan Hospital courtyard on 16 December 2023. These crimes come alongside a public incitement campaign by Israeli officials, media figures, and settlers calling for the annihilation of Palestinians in Gaza, and are also a result of the total impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators—evident by the absence of any meaningful action being taken to hold them accountable by any party or at any level.

The human rights organisation warned that the Israeli army has escalated its premeditated murders, extrajudicial executions, and judicial killings against Palestinian civilians since 7 October through direct targeting with snipers, drones, and running operations in various regions of the Gaza Strip."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

Published On 18 Feb 202418 Feb 2024

**Rafah, Gaze Strip** – Running out of options and solutions, parents in Gaza have resorted to putting their children in the white medical coveralls that were part of COVID-19 PPE kits, in a desperate bid to keep them warm and dry.

Gaza’s displaced – many of them having been forced to move multiple times – are suffering in the severe winter cold with little to protect them from the elements other than thin tents at best.

For many of the 1.4 million people crammed into Rafah after fleeing other parts of Gaza, the only clothes they own are the ones they are wearing. The tanks haven’t stopped for a single moment.”

The tanks briefly seemed to have withdrawn from Maan at one point and Nour’s father tried to go to their house for more clothes.

“But the quadcopters shot at them and he was unable to reach the house. She was very sick and her temperature was high.

“I went out to look for this for her as well because there are many sizes and anyone can wear it.”

![Medical coveralls for warmth in Gaza](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-08-at-6.10.04-PM-1707405187.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C514&quality=80)

Many children only have one set of clothes and, if they get wet, can take days to dry out. If these get wet, there is little chance of them drying again in the cold.

In some areas, teams are distributing white coveralls left over from the pandemic – they are plastic-lined and hold at least some of the damp at bay.

‘Like an astronaut’
-------------------

Nour al-Bayouk, 11, in his coveralls, explains that he, his parents and sisters came here from Maan to escape the bombing.

“We came here to the \[European\] hospital to stay in a tent. Now, they live in them – day and night.

“I’m warm and the water doesn’t get into my clothes,” says Nour. “I have no alternative clothes at all. If my clothes get wet I won’t find anything else to wear.

“At first I looked funny and scary. That’s why we found these suits as an opportunity to save us from the cold and the rain.”

![Medical coveralls for warmth in Gaza](/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WhatsApp-Image-2024-02-08-at-6.10.03-PM-1707405182.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

A child in medical coveralls in a bid to survive the severe cold in Gaza \[Ruwaida Amer/Al Jazeera\]

Raeda al-Khair, 35, who is originally from Gaza City in the north, managed to find space for her family in the European Hospital in Rafah in December. They had fled from Khan Younis, where they had been sheltering until the tanks rolled in at the start of December.

She says: “We came here with nothing. It’s a good idea for us as mothers because the children do not have alternative clothes and there is no place to wash or dry them.”

Life in the tents is becoming unbearable, she says."

1. Israel's intelligence minister Gila Gamliel has been speaking to BBC Radio 4.
    
    She was asked repeatedly about what specific intelligence Israel had for its claims that Hamas had a command centre under Gaza's largest hospital - Al Shifa.
    
    Gamliel did not give details, though she reiterated the Israel Defence Forces' assertion, [in a post on X in the past hour, external](https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1724055160471564623)
    , that Hamas had attacked Israeli soldiers with an RPG from the entrance of al-Quds hospital.
    
    She said Hamas military facilities were located near and even under UN facilities, as well as mosques and schools. Hamas was making "extensive use" of hospitals, medical institutions and ambulances for military purposes, and using Gazans as human shields, she added.
    
    Asked about progress in negotiations on the release of more than 200 Israeli and foreign nationals being held hostage in Gaza, she said Israel did not differentiate between the abductees on the basis of their citizenship or other criteria. Marwan Al-Barsh who is the director-general of the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said there were, "more than a hundred corpses" piled up in the courtyard, with the situation exacerbated by a lack of fuel to power the mortuaries.
    
    "The electricity was cut off by the Israeli occupation forces that targeted the generators, which led to the decomposition and rotting of the corpses as we see worms coming out of them", Al-Barsh said on BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.
    
    Al-Bursh said they were struggling to bury their dead because of threats from the IDF.
    
    “We tried to co-ordinate with the occupation forces so that we would be allowed to bury the dead bodies inside the hospital, yet anyone who attempts to get out of the hospital is directly shot."
    
    Israel asserts that there is a Hamas command centre underneath Al-Shifa - IDF spokeswoman Libby Weiss said: "We know that with certainty." Hamas and hospital authorities deny this.

7. As we reported earlier, Israel [also offered 300 litres of fuel to Al-Shifa hospital](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-middle-east-67400490?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=65522e2e2ea49e2bc009ae46%26IDF%20say%20Hamas%20to%20blame%20for%20no%20fuel%20at%20Al-Shifa%20hospital%262023-11-13T14%3A20%3A23.580Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:ddd42110-6b15-49ac-9481-021a3d42f7fc&pinned_post_asset_id=65522e2e2ea49e2bc009ae46&pinned_post_type=share)
    .
    
    Over a week ago, a US official [said UNRWA was able to access existing reserves in the territory](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-middle-east-67305304?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=65461a831ec331355f96164f%26US%20official%20says%20there%20is%20an%20agreed%20mechanism%20to%20bring%20more%20fuel%20into%20Gaza%262023-11-04T12%3A10%3A30.947Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:142b0677-9933-41aa-9937-e6c97dd522df&pinned_post_asset_id=65461a831ec331355f96164f&pinned_post_type=share)
    , and that there was an "agreed mechanism" for when this fuel ran out.
    
    According to Reuters, Lazzarini said the UN agency had been slowly emptying a fuel depot on the Gaza-Israel border and a request to the Israeli military to replenish it had gone unanswered.

8. A Palestinian woman has told the BBC that Israeli troops stormed the Al-Suwaidi (Swedish) Clinic in Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, and ordered 800 displaced people who had been sheltering there to leave.
    
    “They took the young men out, including my three sons and separated the women and children,” Maryam al-Arabeed, 65, said on Monday morning.
    
    “I saw an Israeli bulldozer completely demolish the Al-Suwaidi building.”
    
    Arabeed said she and six other women, as well as a number of children, walked away from the clinic and slept in the street after being told by the troops to go to Al-Shifa Hospital, which is about 1km (0.6 miles) to the south.
    
    The UN has warned that the situation is dire at Al-Shifa, with constant gunfire and bombings in the area. !Israeli soldiers seen operating in northern Gaza <image:10510>Image source, Reuters
    
    The Israeli army said on Monday that two more soldiers have died during fighting in northern Gaza.
    
    According to [the Israeli media, external](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-13-2023/?utm_source=article_hpsidebar&utm_medium=desktop_site&utm_campaign=liveblog-november-13-2023)
    , the number of Israeli soldiers killed since the beginning of the ground operation had risen to 44.
    
    The Israeli army said it was continuing to carry out raids on the outskirts of the Al-Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City.

11. It says Hamas has a command centre under the hospital - which the hospital and Hamas both deny.
    
    **Al-Quds**
    
    On Sunday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Al-Quds hospital had run out of fuel and was no longer operational.
    
    On Monday, the PCRS said there was "heavy gunfire" and "bombardment" in the area and Israeli tanks and military were stationed near the hospital "from all directions". An Israeli power company says one of its workers was killed by anti-tank fire from Lebanon.
    
    On Sunday, the Israeli army said it launched air strikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah fired mortars and anti-tank missiles towards Israel, causing casualties.
    
    Rocket sirens frequently sound in northern Israeli towns on Lebanese border to warn civilians of incoming attacks.
    
    Hezbollah, whose rocket arsenal is widely believed to dwarf that of Hamas, has been carrying out relatively limited attacks on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October.

CNN  — 

Guns swinging from their hips, two soldiers in black combat boots and green tactical clothing appear to wire explosives to pumps at the Canada Water reservoir in Rafah, southern Gaza.

Moments later, an orange blaze tears through the critical facility in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood, as ribbons of grey smoke erupt into the sky.

The blast was captured in a [now deleted video](https://x.com/ytirawi/status/1816965332952555683)
, which was [reportedly](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/idf-canada-well-rachel-corrie-rafah-water)
 shared by an Israeli soldier on Instagram and geolocated by CNN. The IDF said the incident was under review by the Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism, “an independent investigative mechanism outside the chain of command entrusted with investigating exceptional events in warfare.”

There have been many water facilities damaged or destroyed by Israel’s 10-month-long assault in Gaza, according to the [UN](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-204-west-bank)
 and various other international bodies, compounding the civilian population’s suffering, risking the spread of disease and leading human rights experts to accuse Israel of using [water supply as a weapon](https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/israel-using-water-as-weapon-of-war-as-gaza-supply-plummets-by-94-creating-deadly-health-catastrophe-oxfam/#:~:text=Halima%20Begum%2C%20Oxfam%20GB%20Chief,as%20a%20weapon%20of%20war.)
.

The destruction of the Canada Water reservoir “is certainly a breach of international humanitarian law (IHL),” Mark Zeitoun, director general of the Geneva Water Hub, a Swiss institute specializing in hydro-diplomacy, told CNN.

“IHL is meant to protect against indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population or the objects they depend upon (for) survival,” he said.

Even before the controlled explosion in late July, the Israeli siege drained fuel and electricity supplies needed to power the Canada Water reservoir and other water systems in the city, according to Rafah’s mayor, Ahmed Al-Sofi, causing severe shortages.

“Rafah was already suffering from water shortages,” Al-Sofi told CNN in July. The child was later paralyzed due to the disease, the UN [said](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1826899701003604318)
 on August 23.

World Health Organization (WHO) testing discovered the virus in [sewage samples](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html)
 in Gaza in July, putting thousands of Palestinians at risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.

After the Gaza Ministry of Health declared a polio epidemic last month, the WHO [warned that](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/who-says-polio-vaccine-campaign-hurt-by-lack-gaza-ceasefire-2024-08-07/)
 ongoing Israeli bombardment had stifled vaccination efforts [in Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html)
. They are now calling for a halt to the fighting to allow for an effective vaccination drive.

Widower Alaa Riyad says he treks many miles every day under the glare of the sun to collect water for his family, in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.

The 42-year-old told CNN that he became “father and mother” to his children after his wife and 18 other relatives were killed by Israeli bombardment several months ago.

“We have found worms in the water more than once,” he told CNN. “What can we do?… There is no life for us.”

Israeli attacks in the strip have killed [more than 40,200 Palestinians](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-40000-israel-war-intl/index.html)
 and injured about 93,000 since the war started, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its aerial and ground assault in Gaza after the militant group Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and abducting more than 250, according to Israeli authorities.

‘Near complete destruction of all water infrastructure’
-------------------------------------------------------

Gaza’s water crisis has been building for decades. “The few functioning pumps that are still operating, the quality of the water is so bad… (But) people have no choice but to drink it.”

Within the first week of the war, Saaed Al-Madhoun, an emergency response manager for the humanitarian agency CARE International, was forced to flee an Israeli incursion with his family near their home in Gaza City, which was later flattened by bombardment.

The aid worker is haunted by “constant fear and uncertainty,” as the threat of Israeli attacks loom over his wife and five children, aged between 1 and 13 years old. Footage filmed by a journalist working for CNN shows residents tiptoeing through streams of muddy water pouring through the once-vibrant neighborhood.

The Israeli offensive has displaced up to 1.9 million people – nearly the entire population – in Gaza, according [to the UN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)

## Elaboration
The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The web search results provide context about the conflict in Gaza, including the impact of flooding and actions by the Israeli army. The image search reveals a similar scene of drying clothes on a tank in Indonesia.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

The claim states the image was taken in Gaza in July 2024. The Al Jazeera article from November 2024 discusses flooding in Gaza, which could be related to the image. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's date or location. The tank in the image could be an Israeli tank, but this is not explicitly stated in the evidence.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and location of the image, and the type of tank.

The evidence confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza. The image search results show Israeli tanks in Gaza. The CNN article mentions water shortages in Gaza in July 2024. The BBC article from May 2024 shows an Israeli tank in Gaza.

The claim states the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. While the evidence confirms the presence of Israeli tanks in Gaza, it does not confirm the image's date or the context of the image.

More information is needed to verify the claim, specifically the date and context of the image.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/4/12/weaponising-underwear-genocide-with-a-semi-pornographic-twist): 
Content: "A [recent Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28/)
 titled “Israeli soldiers play with Gaza women’s underwear in online posts” describes how combatants from the world’s self-appointed “most moral army” have been “posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the war in Gaza”.

In one video highlighted by Reuters, an Israeli soldier “sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa”.

Another visually “dissonant” episode features a solider perched on a tank, who proceeds to introduce his “beautiful wife”: a female mannequin sporting a helmet and black bra.

In response to the news agency’s inquiry, an Israeli military spokesperson “sent a statement saying the \[army\] investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values” of Israeli soldiers.

And yet it is pretty perverse in itself to even talk about “values” in the middle of a [genocide](/news/2024/3/26/un-expert-accuses-israel-of-several-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza)
 and Israeli-made [famine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NCbfeEX3Ds)
 in the Gaza Strip.

Since October 7, Israel has [killed](/news/liveblog/2024/4/10/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-bombards-gaza-kills-14-in-nuseirat-camp?update=2828500)
 nearly 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, among them some 14,500 children and 9,500 women – numbers which are presumed to be grave underestimates. 8, 2023 \[AP Photo/Ohad Zwigenberg\]

Let’s pretend for a moment that, in the course of waging war against the state of Israel, Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip had taken to posing for social media posts with lingerie belonging to Israeli women who had been forced to flee their homes and/or killed in the war.

Imagine the moral outrage that would swiftly ensue, inevitably entailing racist and self-righteous allegations of Arab perverseness, the barbaric sexism of Islam, and the violent tendencies of sexually repressed Muslims.

The Fox Newses of the world would have had a field day.

As it turns out, a version of this hypothetical spectacle is true – except that it stars Israeli soldiers and Palestinian women’s lingerie. Children are [starving](/program/newsfeed/2024/3/27/videos-of-malnourished-children-show-gazas-forced-starvation-crisis)
 to death.

Rather than constituting an isolated blot on the morality of the Israeli armed forces, then, social media posts of Palestinian women’s underwear would seem to be aligned with general moral depravity and therefore entirely consistent with Israeli military “values”.

The United Nations Human Rights Office spokesperson has declared such posts to be “demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women”. Ultimately, the taunting display of Palestinian lingerie amounts to an almost pathetically cliched violation of the intimate space of Gazan women. In December, dozens of Palestinian men and boys sheltering at two Gaza schools were detained by the Israeli army, [stripped to their underwear](/news/2023/12/8/video-photos-appear-to-show-detainees-stripped-to-underwear-in-gaza)
, and made to kneel on the ground.

The degradation of Palestinian women is all the more obscenely hypocritical, however, in light of the Israeli military’s condemnation of Hamas for its “discrimination” against women in the territory it controls. A 2022 report by Israel’s State Comptroller, for example, found that approximately one-third of Israeli women performing mandatory military service had experienced sexual harassment the previous year.

The state of Israel has also weaponised the bikini-clad and otherwise half-naked bodies of its female fighting forces in order to effectively sexualise ethnic cleansing, as in the case of the 2007 Maxim magazine spread that tantalisingly wondered whether Israel’s female militants were not in fact “the world’s sexiest soldiers”.

As for the current lingerie tactic being deployed by social media-savvy troops in Gaza, the weaponisation of humiliation only compounds the suffering of Palestinian women – and men – who, forced to flee their homes, have already had their intimate space violated in every possible way.

And as the Israeli military simultaneously gets off playing with underwear and perpetrating genocide, it is a “dissonant visual record”, indeed.

An Israeli soldier stands in an apartment during a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Nov. But to be playing around with the panties of people you are killing takes depravity to another level.

Call it Orientalist fetishization with a genocidal twist.

Granted, it’s not just the females of Gaza who are eligible for such “demeaning” treatment; Gazan males can be intimately humiliated, too. A section on the military’s English-language website devoted to “The Status of Women in Gaza” laments that “basic rights are often systematically denied” to females, who are faced with “decreased educational opportunities” as well as “limited employment opportunities” – a situation that is clearly best rectified by Israel’s bombing of [most such opportunities](/news/2023/12/20/gaza-essential-uninhabitable-as-infrastructure-damage-kills-job-market)
 to smithereens.

The website reports that “violence against women continues at alarming rates” in the Gaza Strip. More than 76,000 people have been wounded as homes, hospitals, [schools](/news/2024/1/24/how-israel-has-destroyed-gazas-schools-and-universities)
 and everything else that is bombable have been bombed."

March 28 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 as a looming [famine](/world/middle-east/destruction-lawlessness-red-tape-hobble-aid-gazans-go-hungry-2024-03-25/)

Elsewhere, another soldier sits atop a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet and says: "I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman."

The two videos shot by Israeli soldiers are among dozens of posts in which troops in Gaza are shown displaying lingerie, mannequins, and in some cases both. Instagram did not comment.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza was launched in response to an attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Oct. By contrast, he said, posts showing weapons or Hamas flags said to have been found in Gazan homes have been circulating widely.

    ### [Senior U.S. The lingerie images have been viewed tens of thousands of times - nearly half a million in one case - after being reposted by Younis Tirawi, who describes himself as a Palestinian reporter.

Approached about images he reposted to his more than 100,000 followers on X between Feb. Reuters then independently verified eight posted on Instagram or YouTube.

"The posting of such images is demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women," said Ravina Shamdasani, U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson.

Reuters sent details of the eight verified posts on YouTube or Instagram to the Israel Defense Forces, requesting comment.

In response, a spokesperson sent a statement saying the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers, as well as reports of videos uploaded to social networks.

"In cases where suspicion of a criminal offense arises that justifies opening an investigation, an investigation is opened by the Military Police," it said.

"It should be clarified that in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the video is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly," the statement said.

The IDF declined to say whether it was referring to any of the images highlighted by Reuters, or whether any of the soldiers responsible have been disciplined.

The Israeli soldiers whom Reuters was able to identify did not respond to requests for comment sent via their social media accounts.

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial search revealed that while there were discussions and meetings between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan in March 2025, there was no direct evidence of Turkey urging the U.S. to control Israel. The subsequent search confirmed escalating tensions between Israel and Syria in March 2025 and Erdogan's strong condemnation of Israel, but still did not provide evidence of Turkey urging the U.S. to intervene.

[Careful footwork: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attends a joint press conference for Israeli President Isaac Herzog's state visit to Ankara, Turkey, on March 9, 2022. This could intensify competition across overlapping spheres of influence – from Syria and Iraq to the Eastern Mediterranean and the South Caucasus.

The characterisation of Turkey as the principal beneficiary of the recent Iran-Israel conflict – emerging unscathed while its two regional rivals engaged in direct confrontation – oversimplifies the pressures facing Ankara’s foreign and security policy. Once close allies now appear to be on a collision course – but it is crucial to discern what is real, what is calibrated for domestic audiences, and how much of the current tension may ultimately prove impermanent.

The Current State of Bilateral Relations
----------------------------------------

Despite efforts to rehabilitate ties between Turkey and Israel following President Isaac Herzog’s [historic state visit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/world/middleeast/israel-isaac-herzog-turkey-visit.html)
 to Ankara in March 2022, relations nosedived as Israel’s military action in Gaza intensified following the horrific Hamas attacks on 7th October 2023, triggering a rising civilian death toll rose and a humanitarian catastrophe there.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of the [harshest critics](https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-recep-tayyip-erdogan-compare-israel-benjamin-netanyahu-adolf-hitler-unga/)
 of the current Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Domestically, Israeli military unilateralism is already emboldening Turkey’s own assertive defence posture, fuelling efforts to strengthen its indigenous military capabilities.

While Israel and Turkey diverge sharply in their visions for the region’s future security architecture, they share some objectives: limit the possibility of Iranian re-entrenchment in the region, particularly across Syria; and the refusal to tolerate hostile actors on their borders.

The Regional Alliance-Building Race
-----------------------------------

For Israel and Iran, the current pause seems to be an opportunity to reframe their post-war narratives and shore up regional allies as a form of strategic deterrence. Such complexity is testament to blurred lines, overlapping trade interests, and transactional diplomacy, a not so hidden receding of previous ‘us or them’ binaries.

The Kurdish Question in Turkey-Israel Ties
------------------------------------------

If tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate to military standoff, it will most likely spark in Syria. [Israel sees](https://www.inss.org.il/social_media/between-the-united-states-turkey-and-israel-insights-from-the-announcement-on-reducing-us-forces-in-syria/)
 diminished American troop presence in Syria as a win for Turkey, and a setback for Israel.

Israel’s support for the Kurds, a group seen as less hostile to Israel, has amplified since the overthrow of the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Rather than direct confrontation, a more imminent risk relates to a sub-threshold conflict or ‘grey zone’ activity between Turkey and Israel.

While the prospect of formal normalisation between Israel and either Lebanon or Syria remains highly improbable, the establishment of a functional non-aggression mechanism – particularly from the perspective of Damascus – could be transformative. This will inevitably call for a recalibration of the strategic triangle between Turkey, Israel, and Iran.

ANKARA, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Turkey will provide weapons systems and logistical tools to Syria under a military cooperation accord signed on Wednesday, a Turkish Defence Ministry source said, adding that Ankara would also train the Syrian army in using such equipment if needed.

Turkey, a NATO member, has been one of Syria's [main foreign allies](/world/middle-east/turkish-foreign-minister-damascus-talks-with-syrias-sharaa-source-says-2025-08-07/)
 since the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad last year. It has vowed to help train and restructure Syria's armed forces, rebuild the country and its institutions, and support efforts to protect Syrian territorial integrity.

In a first step towards a comprehensive military cooperation accord that they have been negotiating for months, Turkey and Syria inked a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday after [meetings](/world/middle-east/syrian-kurdish-ypg-should-stop-delaying-syria-integration-turkey-says-2025-08-13/)
 between their foreign and defence ministers, and intelligence chiefs.

"The memorandum aims to coordinate, plan military training and cooperation, provide consultancy, information and experience sharing, ensure the procurement of military equipment, weapon systems, logistical materials and related services," the Turkish Defence Ministry source told reporters on Thursday.

Last month an official at the Turkish Defence Ministry told Reuters the Syrian army was in need of restructuring after years of conflict, citing shortcomings in discipline, training, organisation, and modernisation.

(March 28, 2025 / JNS)

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, is not a likable person. The severe blows Israel inflicted upon Hezbollah and Iranian assets in Syria provided the jihadists led by Ahmed al-Sharaa (the nom de guerre for Mohammad al-Julani), a path to victory over Assad’s forces.

According to an article published in the _Türkiye_ newspaper on March 17, “[Turkey will train](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2025/02/03/742137/Turkey-military-bases-Syria)
 the country’s army in two military bases it will establish in Syria.” The paper also reported that “Turkey and Syria will sign a joint defense agreement. The commission also declared that “Religious minorities in Turkey have expressed concerns that governmental rhetoric and policies contribute to an increasingly hostile environment and [implicitly encourage](https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256675/how-difficult-is-it-to-be-a-christian-in-turkey-what-you-need-to-know)
 acts of societal aggression and violence.”

With his incompetent handling of the Turkish economy and his avoidance of the difficult tasks required to heal it, Erdoğan seeks “victories” in foreign affairs, including his meddling in Jerusalem’s management of Islamic holy sites. 

In September, for instance, Erdoğan accused Israel of targeting the Al-Aqsa Mosque as part of an expansionist Israeli drive. He also urged the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to convene an emergency summit to discuss the war in Gaza and accused Israel of attacks on Muslims in Jerusalem.  

The Trump administration must reconsider providing F-16 jet fighters to Turkey, as well its place in NATO. The United States must also protect the Kurds of northeastern Syria from repeated attacks by the Turkish armed forces. 

Under Erdoğan, Turkey is fighting the [Syrian Democratic Forces](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/syria-sharaa-assad-damascus-aleppo-killed-violence-tartus-kurd-latakia-rcna195580)
, an ally of the United States, and threatening Israel, America’s only reliable ally in the Middle East. Powered by Salamandra

Turkey’s moves in Syria threaten Israel  
=========================================

It is time for the United States to address the excesses of Turkey’s president.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. We must only be strong.”

Turkey’s president has escalated his attacks on Israel since the Oct. He has sought to incite the Sunni-Muslim world against Israel, and according to many in Israel, Erdoğan’s hostility toward Israel has reached a point where many in the Jewish state see a Sunni-Muslim crescent led by Erdoğan just as threatening as the Shiite-Muslim crescent led by Iran’s Ayatollah Khamenei.

A Turkish military presence on Syrian territory could present a real threat to the State of Israel. 

The Trump administration must consider measures against the megalomaniacal Turkish leader, who is unreliable insofar as NATO is concerned. Erdoğan purchased Russian S-400 missiles designed to shoot down NATO planes, and Russia provided the Turkish armed forces with advanced weapons capable of covering most of Syria, as well as their old adversary, Greece (also a NATO member), in contravention of NATO rules.

Under Erdoğan, religious minorities in Turkey are also faring badly, according to the U.S. Photo by Rory Arnold/No10 Downing Street via Wikimedia Commons.](https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/03/erdogan-1320x880.jpg "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan attends a meeting at Vahdettin Palace in Istanbul on Jan. Certainly not outside of Turkey, but also among a great many inside the country. Considered by many a megalomaniac who views himself as the caliph of the Sunni-Muslim world, he seeks to recreate the Ottoman Empire.

Some, like the jihadists who took over Syria with Erdoğan’s equipment, training and cash, look up to him. According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed soon, Ankara will help Syria if Damascus faces a sudden threat.”

_Türkiye_ also reported the government’s plan to have 50 Turkish Air Force F-16 jetfighters nest inside the new bases to support and protect the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from collapse until a new Syrian air force is established.

Erdoğan has far greater ambitions than simply training Syrian Sunni rebels.

The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported on a large-scale military mobilization by Turkish forces, along with an extensive deployment of mine engineering teams, in the villages of Mar’anaz, Al-Alqamiyah and Menagh in northern Syria.

Should Erdoğan deploy the F-16 jet fighters in Syria, it would threaten Israeli security and hinder Israeli preventive operations inside Syria.

Israel has established a temporary buffer zone on the Syrian slopes of Mount Hermon to protect its citizens in the Golan Heights from jihadist forces."

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025, and the US President Donald Trump offering to mediate. <image:10532>

En.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, mentioning meetings between Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025, and Israeli strikes on Syrian government troops in July 2025. It also mentions that on March 14, 2025, Syrian Druze leaders were allowed to visit Israel. <image:10541>, <image:10536>, <image:10538>, <image:10540>

*Le Monde diplomatique* ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) discusses Turkey's relationship with Israel, mentioning a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr. <image:1>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in February 2025, there were talks between Turkey and Israel regarding Syria, and the US President offered to mediate ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)). Additionally, on March 30, 2025, Turkish President Erdoğan gave a speech ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)). However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

On March 30, 2025, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)).

While this indicates strong disapproval of Israel's actions, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey urged the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Alexandra Braverman, Annika Ganzeveld, Kelly Campa, Carolyn Moorman, Siddhant Kishore, Katherine Wells, Ria Reddy, Johanna Moore, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.

For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:46>)
web_search("Iranian strikes against Israel October 1 2024")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Indonesia': 0.23, 'Malaysia': 0.15, 'Sri Lanka': 0.15, 'Bangladesh': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.06, 'Philippines': 0.05, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Uganda': 0.03, 'India': 0.02, 'Nigeria': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (<image:2136>). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (<image:2128>) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (<image:2130>).

The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (<image:2136>). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (<image:2128>) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (<image:2130>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 14, 2024, showing an image of tents on fire (<image:10563>). NBC News published an image of a fire (<image:10564>). The Hindu published an article about an Israeli strike on a hospital tent camp in Gaza (<image:10565>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital), [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877), and [https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.

* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:46>)
web_search("Iranian strikes against Israel October 1 2024")
image_search("fire tents Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Indonesia': 0.23, 'Malaysia': 0.15, 'Sri Lanka': 0.15, 'Bangladesh': 0.13, 'Cambodia': 0.06, 'Philippines': 0.05, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Uganda': 0.03, 'India': 0.02, 'Nigeria': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel on October 1, 2024, including a major Iranian missile attack on Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attacks were in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, and the assassination of leaders. The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats (ISW) also published an update on the same day, detailing the Iranian ballistic missile attack, Hezbollah's attacks, and IDF ground operations in Lebanon ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)).

The ISW update also mentions attacks by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and Houthi attacks on Israel, and includes a map of Houthi attacks (<image:2136>). The NPR article includes images of military vehicles (<image:2128>) and a destroyed building with a picture of a leader (<image:2130>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article on October 14, 2024, showing an image of tents on fire (<image:10563>). NBC News published an image of a fire (<image:10564>). The Hindu published an article about an Israeli strike on a hospital tent camp in Gaza (<image:10565>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/14/burned-and-charred-bodies-as-israel-hits-tents-at-central-gaza-hospital), [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-airstrike-gaza-family-rafah-wiped-out-rcna154877), and [https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strike-on-hospital-tent-camp-in-gaza-kills-4-and-ignites-a-fire-that-burns-dozens/article68751478.ece).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, potentially involving tents. The web search confirms that there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and that the conflict involved missile attacks and other actions. The image search reveals that similar images of fires, including those involving tents, were published in the context of the conflict. However, the evidence does not directly link the image in the claim to the Iranian strikes against Israel. The geolocation data does not help to verify the claim.

To verify the claim, it would be necessary to determine the exact location and context of the fire in the image.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the October 1, 2024, Iranian strikes on Israel, codenamed Operation True Promise II. <image:46> The attack involved approximately 200 ballistic missiles launched from Iran, targeting Israeli military facilities, including airbases. The strikes were in retaliation for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and other leaders. The article mentions damage to airbases, a school, and homes, as well as casualties, including fatalities. The article also mentions that Israel retaliated with strikes on Iran later in the month.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an article on October 14, 2024, about a strike on a hospital in Gaza, showing an image of a destroyed tent camp (<image:10627>). Politico published an image of a fire (<image:10628>).


## Elaboration

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)
 Israel for two waves of attacks where the explosion of [pagers](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched an attack on Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. The image search results show images of fire and blasts at the airbase. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely false. The image may depict a different event or be digitally altered. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'South Korea': 0.88, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'Chile': 0.01, 'Czech Republic': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Taiwan': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Hezbollah claimed to have launched rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024, according to Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)). Politico.eu also reported on the attack ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)).

The Jerusalem Post also discussed Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Ramat David airbase ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)). The Al Jazeera article includes images of damage in Kiryat Bialik, Israel, following a Hezbollah attack <image:i>. The Jerusalem Post article includes an image of Israeli air force technicians working on a F-16 Fighting Falcon in Ramat David Airbase <image:592369>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources report on an attack on Ramat David airbase. One source states that Hezbollah targeted the airbase with missiles (<image:5620>). Another source published an image of a fire (<image:5621>). A third source discusses huge blasts in the airbase (<image:5622>).

The sources are: [https://defapress.ir/en/news/85030/hezbollah-targeted-ramat-david-airbase-with-several-missiles](https://defapress.ir/en/news/85030/hezbollah-targeted-ramat-david-airbase-with-several-missiles), [https://www.palestinechronicle.com/gaza-live-blog-beirut-death-toll-rises-strike-in-zaytoun-israels-aggression-on-lebanon-continues-day-351/](https://www.palestinechronicle.com/gaza-live-blog-beirut-death-toll-rises-strike-in-zaytoun-israels-aggression-on-lebanon-continues-day-351/) and [https://parstoday.ir/en/news/west_asia-i230538-huge_blasts_in_ramat_david_airbase_of_israel_five_important_points_about_hezbollah's_broad_attack](https://parstoday.ir/en/news/west_asia-i230538-huge_blasts_in_ramat_david_airbase_of_israel_five_important_points_about_hezbollah's_broad_attack).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched an attack on Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. The image search results show images of fire and blasts at the airbase. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely false. The image may depict a different event or be digitally altered. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that Hezbollah attacked Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the geolocation data suggests the image was taken in South Korea, not Israel. While the web search and image search results confirm the attack, they do not validate the authenticity of the specific image in the claim.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is likely false. While multiple sources ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/), and [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)) confirm the attack on Ramat David Airbase by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, the geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:50>)
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
image_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. Health officials said most of the victims were women and children.

The strike that destroyed the infant girl’s home hit Abasan al-Kabira, a village just outside of Khan Younis near the border with Israel, killing at least 16 people, mostly women and children, according to the nearby European Hospital, which received the dead.

It was inside an area the Israeli military ordered evacuated earlier this week, encompassing most of eastern Gaza.

Nabil Abu Dagga, a relative of Ella’s family who lives nearby, rushed to the scene of the strike.

“People were sitting together and enjoying themselves on a Ramadan night, staying up together as a family,” he said. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

 [airstrikes](https://www.newarab.com/news/huge-blasts-gaza-suggests-israel-using-suicide-apcs)
 on the Sabra neighbourhood in Gaza City.

Emergency workers spent hours digging through the debris after the strikes flattened residential buildings, leaving civilians buried under concrete, wood, and metal. According to local reports, civil defence teams also rescued a mother and three of her children from the same area.

Mohamad Safa, a Lebanese diplomat and UN representative, wrote on X: "The baby who remained under the rubble all night in Gaza has made it safely. Share positivity."

The widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and renewed attention on the toll it has taken on children.

"The picture says it all: an attempt to rescue a baby from beneath the rubble of his home. Most hospitals and medical facilities across Gaza have been damaged or destroyed.

_Al Jazeera_ journalist [Anas al-Sharif](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-journalist-removes-protective-gear-after-truce-announcement)
 commented on the rescue: "This is the reality for children in Gaza. Others called the scenes an "unfathomable injustice".

Gaza's civil defence teams and the Palestinian Ministry of Health have repeatedly warned that Israel’s ongoing blockade and bombardment have crippled emergency response capabilities. If they survive the bombs, they are often left wounded, traumatised, or buried beneath the rubble of their homes. They grow up not with toys, but with the sounds of drones and airstrikes."

The baby, whose name has not yet been released, was one of several civilians pulled from the wreckage. What did the children do to deserve living through and feeling the pain and bitterness of war?" one user [wrote on X](https://x.com/SolimanHijjy/status/1929825392375874029)

![Five-year-old Ward Khalil talking about her ordeal in the ruins of a building.](/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/war-khalil-1748515400.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

Five-year-old Ward Khalil survived an Israeli air attack early on Monday that killed her mother, two of her siblings and 33 other people \[Al Jazeera\]

Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a 36-year-old paediatrician and mother of 10, spent the morning of Friday, May 23, doing what she had devoted her life to: Saving children at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital. Two remain buried beneath the rubble, including her youngest, six-month-old Sayden, still asleep in his crib when Dr al-Najjar kissed him goodbye that morning.

In just one Israeli air strike – in just one minute – her entire world was annihilated.

Her husband Hamdy, 40, also a doctor, and their son Adam, 11, are in the ICU, their lives hanging by a thread inside Gaza’s disintegrating health system – not by chance but by design. She was one of 18,000 Palestinian children killed since October, one of 1,300+ since Israel broke the ceasefire in March, and one of dozens in just 48 hours.

Commenting on the moral double standards applied to Palestinians, Dan Sheehan, editor at Literary Hub, noted: “If an 11-year-old Israeli influencer – a girl who delivered food and toys to displaced children – had been killed, the Empire State Building would be lit up for her. Video footage showed Danny Danon – his Israeli counterpart – stifling a yawn in response.

In the face of the death of Palestinian children, Israel yawns in indifference. This is unsurprising, with a recent poll showing that 82 percent of Jewish Israelis support expelling Palestinians from Gaza. How can Palestinians be told, then, to bring themselves – and their children – to Israeli military aid delivery stations and expect safety, not savagery? Will the number of 18,000 Palestinian children – whose names we may never fully know – not be enough?

In December 2023, UNICEF, the UN’s children’s agency, declared: “The Gaza Strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child.” On May 27, the organisation stated that “Since the end of the ceasefire on 18 March, 1,309 children have reportedly been killed and 3,738 injured. But, in Gaza, girls running from fire, pulled from the rubble and burned beyond recognition are not enough to provoke action.

In Gaza, when children are caught in the fire of relentless bombing, the world turns its back. In tears, Dr Alaa begged rescuers to let her hold her daughter one last time.

Sadly, the white shrouds wrapped around the bodies of Gaza’s children continue to mount.

Yaqeen Hammad is now one of those shrouded and buried children.

Just 11 years old, Yaqeen was one of Gaza’s youngest social media influencers. In one of her videos, while preparing food, she told the world: “In Gaza, we don’t know the word impossible.” This was her crime.

On May 23, the same day Alaa’s children were incinerated, Israel decided that Yaqeen was somehow a threat to its existence."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

Content: "Residents had to open a hole in the wall to evacuate the dead and wounded**,” UNRWA told _UN News_.

Since the start of the war between Hamas and Israel on 7 October 2023, **more than 400 schools have received a direct hit**, according to satellite imagery analyzed by the UN.

**Deadly aftermath**
--------------------

Footage from the scene provided by the UN agency showed walls and floors blown out in the main school building.

In the courtyard, hundreds of people could be seen standing amid crumpled metal sheeting on the morning after the attack, with rubble and wooden planks strewn around where their shelters had been standing just hours earlier.

“Our colleagues are reporting that surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours,” UNRWA said.

The agency noted that fatalities included women and children, while search and rescue operations are ongoing for several people still missing.

Many of those living at the school when it was hit have been displaced “countless times” by the war, which began on 7 October 2023, following Hamas-led terror attacks on Israel, UNRWA stressed.

The attack also sparked a fire in an adjacent school where more tents and temporary shelters were burned and damaged.

Education destroyed
-------------------

[According to the UN Satellite Service, UNOSAT](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/verification-damages-schools-based-proximity-damaged-sites-gaza-occupied-palestinian-territory-update-9-may-2025)
, 95.4 per cent of schools in Gaza have sustained damage since the start of the war.

**Of the enclave’s 564 schools, 501 will either need full reconstruction or major rehabilitation work to be functional again**.

“There is no humanity left in Gaza, and no humanity left as the world continues to watch day after day as families are bombed, burned alive and starved,” UNRWA said after the latest attack.

**Failed strategy won’t work: Türk**
------------------------------------

In a related development, the [UN human rights chief](https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/high-commissioner)
 Volker Türk [on Wednesday condemned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/turk-israeli-plans-expand-gaza-offensive-aggravate-concerns-regarding)
 Israel’s reported plans to forcibly transfer Gaza’s population to a small area in the south of the Strip.

**The move fuels concern that Israel’s intention is to make life for Palestinians “increasingly incompatible with their continued existence in Gaza”**, he said in a statement.

> 'Surviving parents and children are trying to salvage their belongings among the blood and body parts of their relatives and neighbours' - UNRWA

“There is no reason to believe that doubling down on military strategies, which, for a year and eight months, have not led to a durable resolution, including the release of all hostages, will now succeed,” insisted the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Expanding the offensive on Gaza “will almost certainly cause further mass displacement, more deaths and injuries of innocent civilians, and the destruction of Gaza’s little remaining infrastructure”, he continued.

**Rights experts warn of irreversible consequences**
----------------------------------------------------

Escalating atrocities in Gaza mark a critical moral turning point and demand urgent international action, UN-appointed independent human rights experts said [in a statement](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/05/end-unfolding-genocide-or-watch-it-end-life-gaza-un-experts-say-states-face)

**Occupied West Bank update**
-----------------------------

In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, UN aid teams warned of worsening conditions for Palestinian communities **because of “violence by Israeli forces and settlers”**.

The alert comes after Israeli forces on Monday demolished more than 30 structures in Khallet Athaba, a hamlet in Hebron governorate, displacing nearly a dozen families – or around 50 people.

“This constitutes most of the structures in the community and marks the third and largest demolition there since February,” said UN aid coordination office, [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)

New horror in Gaza as double strike on school shelter kills 30
==============================================================

**By** **Daniel Johnson**

7 May 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Grim details emerged on Wednesday of Israeli airstrikes on a UN-run school in Gaza sheltering 2,000 displaced people, which reportedly killed 30 Palestinians sheltering there.

The UN agency for Palestine refugees, [UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
, maintained that Israeli forces hit the school in Al Bureij, Middle Gaza, at around 6pm on Tuesday and again at 10.20pm.

“**The school sustained severe damage and a fire broke out in the shelter, making it difficult to evacuate the casualties. – Israel continues its relentless destruction of life in Gaza**,” they warned, citing attacks by land, air and sea, and a soaring civilian death toll.

“No one is spared – not children, persons with disabilities, nursing mothers, journalists, health professionals, aid workers, or hostages,” they said, noting that on 18 March alone, 600 Palestinians were reportedly killed, 400 of them children. They are among more than 100 buildings slated for demolition, following an Israeli notice issued at the start of the month.

**Forcible transfer fears**
---------------------------

OCHA described how dozens of families in the camp were given little time on Monday to collect their belongings before their homes were demolished.

The agency highlighted the “strong push” to uproot Palestinians living in the area “**once again raising concerns about the risks of forcible transfer of the population**”.

Under international law, Israel as the occupying power, has the responsibility to protect Palestinians in the West Bank and ensure their safety and dignity, OCHA insisted.

Humanitarian partners are mobilizing assistance, but urgent international engagement is needed to stop these coercive measures and protect vulnerable communities, the UN aid office said.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children are killed in latest Israeli strikes in Gaza, health officials say
=================================================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 May 24, 2025 6:47 PM EDT

CAIRO (AP) — The bodies of 79 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday, a toll that doesn’t include hospitals in the battered north that it said are now inaccessible.

Nine of a doctor’s 10 children were among those killed in Israel’s renewed military offensive, colleagues and the Health Ministry said.

Alaa Najjar, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital, was on duty at the time and ran home to find her family’s house on fire, Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital’s pediatric department, told The Associated Press.

[**READ MORE:** Palestinian children suffering from malnutrition overwhelm Gaza’s Nasser Hospital](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-children-suffering-from-malnutrition-overwhelm-gazas-nasser-hospital)

Najjar’s husband was severely wounded and their only surviving child, an 11-year-old son, was in critical condition after Friday’s strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, Farra said.

The dead children ranged in age from 7 months to 12 years old. Khalil Al-Dokran, a spokesperson for Gaza’s Health Ministry, told the AP that two of the children remained under the rubble.

Israel’s military in a statement said it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces, and described the area of Khan Younis as a “dangerous war zone.” It said it had evacuated civilians from the area, and “the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.”

Earlier on Saturday, a statement said Israel’s air force struck over 100 targets throughout Gaza over the past day.

The Health Ministry said the new deaths brought the war’s toll to 53,901 since the Oct. and aid groups deny there is significant diversion.

Hospitals in Gaza are again reporting attacks and other Israeli pressure.

The Health Ministry said 11 security personnel have been trapped at the European Hospital in southern Gaza following heavy gunfire and airstrikes since at least Tuesday. This week, the [first aid trucks entered](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/netanyahu-says-hell-allow-some-aid-into-gaza-after-pressure-from-allies)
 the territory and began reaching Palestinians since the blockade began.

COGAT, the Israeli defense body overseeing aid for Gaza, said 388 trucks had entered since Monday. Hams said the security staff stayed behind to protect from looting, and that it was the only hospital in Gaza offering neurosurgery, cardiac care and cancer treatment.

Israel said it will continue to strike Gaza until Hamas releases all of the 58 remaining Israeli hostages and disarms. Netanyahu has rejected those terms and has vowed to maintain control over Gaza and facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its Palestinian population.

“The Israeli government and its leader have a clear choice: deal or war, saving lives or abandonment,” Liran Berman, brother of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman, told a weekly rally in Tel Aviv as families and supporters again demanded an agreement that would bring everyone home.

 [Samy Magdy, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/samy-magdy-associated-press) The ministry said 3,747 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed the war on March 18 in an effort to pressure Hamas to accept different ceasefire terms. Its count doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants.

Israel’s pressure on Hamas has included a blockade of Gaza and its over 2 million people since early March. Saleh Hams, director of the nursing department, said patients were evacuated after an Israeli strike on May 13. 7 attack, in which militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 others.

Hamas has said it will only return the remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from the territory."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:59>)
web_search("Palestinian child rubble Gaza Israeli airstrike")
image_search("child trapped rubble Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News reported on March 20, 2025, about a month-old girl rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike that killed her parents and brother. The war began on October 7, 2023. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/month-old-girl-pulled-from-rubble-in-gaza-after-airstrike-killed-her-parents))

The New Arab published an article on June 3, 2025, about a baby rescued from the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. The article mentions that widely circulated images of the baby have sparked international condemnation of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The article also mentions that more than 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded since October 2023. <image:59>

### Evidence from `image_search`
NBC News published a video about rescue workers fighting to save children trapped in Gaza City airstrike rubble. (<image:10680>) Al Jazeera published an article about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, which includes an image of children near rubble. (<image:10681>)

*   [https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rescue-workers-fight-to-save-children-trapped-in-gaza-city-airstrike-rubble-196401733655)
*   [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/19/israels-war-against-gazas-children-explained)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza. The geolocate tool indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm that there have been Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, resulting in children being trapped in the rubble. The New Arab article mentions that images of children in the rubble have sparked international condemnation. The NBC News video and Al Jazeera article also show images of children near rubble in Gaza.

The claim states the image was taken in July 2024. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date the image was taken. The PBS News article mentions the war began on October 7, 2023. The New Arab article was published on June 3, 2025. Therefore, the claim's date cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The UN News article from May 7, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a UN-run school in Al Bureij, Gaza, which killed 30 Palestinians, including women and children.

([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996)) <image:10682>

PBS News published an article on May 24, 2025, reporting on Israeli strikes in Gaza, including an airstrike in Khan Younis that killed nine of a doctor's ten children. The article also states that the war's toll has reached 53,901 since October. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nine-of-a-doctors-10-children-are-killed-in-latest-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-health-officials-say](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nine-of-a-doctors-10-children-are-killed-in-latest-israeli-strikes-in-gaza-health-officials-say)) <image:10683>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Save the Children published an article about children in Gaza, including an image of a child standing in front of rubble. ([https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza)) <image:10688> VPM.org published an article on October 7, 2024, with photos from the year since October 7, including an image of children near rubble. ([https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7](https://www.vpm.org/npr-news/npr-news/2024-10-07/photos-a-look-back-at-the-year-since-oct-7)) <image:10689>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a [collapsed apartment](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-03-20-2025-36c07d3dc7c03f66f86f44409d504d43)
 building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli [airstrike](https://apnews.com/live/latest-updates-israel-launches-new-wave-of-airstrikes-across-gaza-after-ceasefire-talks-stall)
.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Save the Children published an article about children in Gaza, including an image of a child standing in front of rubble. ([https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza](https://www.savethechildren.net/stories/nowhere-safe-children-gaza)) <image:10688> VPM.org published an article on October 7, 2024, with photos from the year since October 7, including an image of children near rubble.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, with a high probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel. The web searches and image searches provide additional context, showing that children have been affected by Israeli airstrikes, and many have been killed or wounded. However, the exact date of the image cannot be verified.
