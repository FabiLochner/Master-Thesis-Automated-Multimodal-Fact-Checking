The article mentions negotiations and disagreements regarding the US's stance on the resolution.

## Final Judgement
The search results do not contain any information about the US reinstituting the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. The provided sources discuss US involvement in the conflict through draft resolutions and voting, but they do not mention the draft being reinstituted.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results, including articles from the Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/22/un-security-council-does-not-pass-us-resolution-calling-for-gaza-ceasefire](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/22/un-security-council-does-not-pass-us-resolution-calling-for-gaza-ceasefire)), do not support the claim. They focus on US diplomatic efforts and resolutions related to the conflict, without any mention of the draft being reinstituted.
