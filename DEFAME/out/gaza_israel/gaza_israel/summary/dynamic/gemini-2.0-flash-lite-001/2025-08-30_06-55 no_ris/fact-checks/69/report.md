### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5178173-israeli-forces-infiltrate-several-syrian-villages-quneitra-and-daraa): 
Content: The search result from Asharq Al-Awsat discusses Israeli forces infiltrating several Syrian villages in Quneitra and Daraa. ![image 7729](media/2025-08-29_22-01-1756504903-285686.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image likely depicts Israeli military forces. The `geolocate` function indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. The `web_search` results confirm that Israeli forces have been active in the Daraa governorate, including the town of Tasil, which aligns with the claim. The `image_search` also supports the presence of Israeli forces in the region.

The claim states the image was taken in February 2025. The provided sources mention the Israeli invasion of Syria starting in December 2024 and ongoing activity in 2025, which supports the timeframe.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely accurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from the web and image searches confirms that Israeli forces have been active in the Daraa governorate, including the town of Tasil, and the timeframe aligns with the claim. The geolocate function also supports the image's origin.
