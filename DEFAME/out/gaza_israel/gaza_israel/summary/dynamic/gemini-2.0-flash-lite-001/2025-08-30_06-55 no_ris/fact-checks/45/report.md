### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y264x3nnno](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y264x3nnno)), PBS News ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-deports-greta-thunberg-after-seizing-of-gaza-bound-ship](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-deports-greta-thunberg-after-seizing-of-gaza-bound-ship)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza)) reported that Greta Thunberg was deported by Israel in June 2025 after being intercepted on a Gaza-bound aid boat. Thunberg accused Israel of kidnapping her and other activists. The articles include images of Thunberg in Paris ![image 8621](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511981-339109.jpg), on a plane ![image 8624](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511985-108339.jpg), and on the aid ship ![image 8625](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511985-316133.jpg), ![image 8627](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511991-947472.jpg), as well as at the airport ![image 8626](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511988-900679.jpg).

The BBC article also includes a map ![image 8620](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511979-071109.jpg) and other images ![image 8617](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511977-666728.jpg), ![image 8618](media/2025-08-29_23-59-1756511977-803866.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments. Specifically, a video from December 2024 shows her saying, "And f--- Israel!" Additionally, in June 2025, she was deported by Israel after being intercepted on a Gaza-bound aid boat. However, the evidence does not include an image of Thunberg holding a sign that says "Fuck Israel." Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments, but there is no evidence to support the claim that she held a sign that said "Fuck Israel."

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments, including saying "And f--- Israel!" in December 2024, and being deported from Israel in June 2025, there is no evidence to support the specific image of her holding a sign that says "Fuck Israel."
