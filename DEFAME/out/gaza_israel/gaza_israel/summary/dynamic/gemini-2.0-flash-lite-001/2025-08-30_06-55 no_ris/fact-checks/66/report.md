## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Spotlight by EBU article from March 13, 2025, addresses a claim that Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory, and the video was shared on September 23, 2024. The handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

The CNN article from March 19, 2025, discusses the exchange of attacks between Ukraine and Russia. ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-intl-hnk)) The Euronews article from March 7, 2025, reports that Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce after a Russian missile attack.

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of Zelenskyy signing a bomb (![image 7264](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502412-972178.jpg)). The BBC News website shows an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing what appear to be artillery shells (![image 7265](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-075257.jpg)). The Penn Capital-Star published an image of Volodymyr Zelenskyy (![image 7267](media/2025-08-29_21-20-1756502413-342824.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory. The video was shared on September 23, 2024, not in March 2025. The handwritten messages do not reference the war in Ukraine or the conflict in Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory, not Israeli bombs. The event occurred in September 2024, not March 2025, and the context of the signing does not involve Gaza.
