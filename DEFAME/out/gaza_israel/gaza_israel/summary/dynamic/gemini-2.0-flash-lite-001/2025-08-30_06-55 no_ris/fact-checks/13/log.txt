Content: The Associated Press reports an explosion near a U.S. military facility near Baghdad airport late Tuesday, one day before an expected visit by Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The article mentions the explosion occurred at 11 p.m.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_US_bases_during_the_Gaza_war): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Attacks on US bases during the Gaza war" mentions attacks on US bases in Iraq, including drone and missile strikes on Al-Asad Airbase and Al-Harir Air Base. It also mentions a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024. The article also includes a Reuters article about explosions at a PMF security agency base south of Baghdad on July 30, 2024, and an AP News article about an explosion at a US military facility near Baghdad airport.

The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence confirms an explosion near a US military facility near Baghdad airport on September 30, 2024 ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/iraq-iran-us-coalition-baghdad-airport-explosion-strike-979e60a83c35009fd555065f0ebd767f)), but the image's connection to this event and the Israel-Hezbollah conflict remains unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
