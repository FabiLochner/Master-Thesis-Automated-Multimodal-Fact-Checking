The drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model. The New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/20/world/middleeast/israel-tel-aviv-missile-yemen.html)) reports on a missile attack by Houthi militants in Tel Aviv, which occurred early Saturday morning, and at least 16 people were lightly wounded.
