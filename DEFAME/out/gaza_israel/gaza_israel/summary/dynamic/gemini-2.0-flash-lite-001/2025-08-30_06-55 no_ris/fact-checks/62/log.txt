Useful result: From [Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/images-of-demonstration-in-solidarity-with-palestine-from-bangladesh-circulate-as-from-india/): 
Content: The article from Kashif, published on April 14, 2025, discusses images of a demonstration in solidarity with Palestine that were falsely claimed to be from Kolkata, India. The images are actually from a demonstration in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The article includes an image <image:5429> and mentions the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

The claim '<image:37> This image shows thousands gathering at Sohrawardi Park in Kolkata, India, in April 2025 to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.' is false.
