Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html): 
Content: The Voice of America (VOA) published an article discussing Esmail Qaani's visit to Bamiyan province in Afghanistan in July 2018. Qaani, who was then the deputy commander of the Quds Force, introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat. Afghan officials are investigating the nature of his visit, as Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan. The article includes a photo of Qaani <image:10657>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article on June 30, 2025, about Esmail Qaani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. <image:0>. The article includes a photo of Esmail Qaani.

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.

The image of Esmail Qaani in a hijab is digitally altered, as reported by Waradana.com ([https://waradana.com/english/article/143531-irgc-commander-disguised-in-womens-clothing-out-of-fear-of-assassinations](https://waradana.com/english/article/143531-irgc-commander-disguised-in-womens-clothing-out-of-fear-of-assassinations)). The original photo shows Qaani in a black outfit, head cap, and sunglasses.

So, the overall veracity is: false
