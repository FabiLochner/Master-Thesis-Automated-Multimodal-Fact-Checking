Content: According to Press TV, Hezbollah claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024. <image:10238>. The article also mentions that the attack was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities.

The claim 'Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Major General Tomer Bar has been killed by Hеzbollаh in Tel Aviv in a drone attack in November 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checks from [aol.com](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html) and Inshorts ([https://inshorts.com/en/news/israeli-air-force-chief-tomer-bar-alive--not-killed-by-hezbollah-1733746115536](https://inshorts.com/en/news/israeli-air-force-chief-tomer-bar-alive--not-killed-by-hezbollah-1733746115536)) confirm that Tomer Bar is alive. Although there are reports of a drone attack on his residence, this does not confirm the claim of his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
