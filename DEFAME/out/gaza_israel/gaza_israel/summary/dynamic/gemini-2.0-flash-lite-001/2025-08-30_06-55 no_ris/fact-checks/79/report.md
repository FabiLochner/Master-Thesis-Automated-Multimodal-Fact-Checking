The Jerusalem Post also discussed Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Ramat David airbase ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)). The Al Jazeera article includes images of damage in Kiryat Bialik, Israel, following a Hezbollah attack <image:i>. The Jerusalem Post article includes an image of Israeli air force technicians working on a F-16 Fighting Falcon in Ramat David Airbase <image:592369>.

Another source published an image of a fire (![image 5621](media/2025-08-23_01-47-1755913657-305391.jpg)). A third source discusses huge blasts in the airbase (![image 5622](media/2025-08-23_01-47-1755913658-051277.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched an attack on Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. The image search results show images of fire and blasts at the airbase. However, the geolocation of the image in the claim suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely false. The image may depict a different event or be digitally altered. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's authenticity and origin.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that Hezbollah attacked Ramat David Airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the geolocation data suggests the image was taken in South Korea, not Israel. While the web search and image search results confirm the attack, they do not validate the authenticity of the specific image in the claim.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is likely false. While multiple sources ([Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel), [Politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/), and [The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)) confirm the attack on Ramat David Airbase by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024, the geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in South Korea, not Israel.
