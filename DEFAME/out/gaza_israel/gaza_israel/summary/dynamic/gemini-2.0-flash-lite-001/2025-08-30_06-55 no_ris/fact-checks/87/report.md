## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel published an article in August 2025 discussing Israel's readiness to support Lebanon in disarming Hezbollah, referencing a November 2024 ceasefire deal and ongoing tensions. The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, about attacks between Israel and Hezbollah, quoting Benjamin Netanyahu. The Washington Jewish Week published an article on August 29, 2025, discussing the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, mentioning that Hezbollah had fired more than 8,000 rockets and 200 UAVs into Israel by August 2024.

The articles include images of Hezbollah supporters, US envoy Tom Barrack, the conflict, and the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office ![image 56](media/87.jpg).
The Guardian article is available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/netanyahu-says-attacks-on-hezbollah-in-lebanon-not-the-end-of-the-story](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/netanyahu-says-attacks-on-hezbollah-in-lebanon-not-the-end-of-the-story). The Times of Israel article is available at [https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-israel-is-ready-to-support-lebanon-in-disarming-hezbollah/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-israel-is-ready-to-support-lebanon-in-disarming-hezbollah/).


### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shortly-after-strike-pms-office-releases-photo-of-netanyahu-at-military-hq/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office. ![image 7796](media/2025-08-29_22-04-1756505054-604978.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024. The Guardian article, published on August 25, 2024, includes the image. The Times of Israel also published an article that includes the image. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim that Hezbollah captured and published the image cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm Hezbollah's involvement in capturing and publishing the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Royanews.tv published an article on August 9, 2024, discussing an image purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone showing Benjamin Netanyahu in his office, stating that the image is a composite created from an older image published in 2009 ![image 10656](media/2025-08-30_07-28-1756538887-185382.jpg). Al Jazeera published an article on October 22, 2024, stating that Hezbollah claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's holiday residence ![image 7796](media/2025-08-29_22-04-1756505054-604978.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence now suggests that Hezbollah was involved with an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Royanews.tv reported that an image, purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone, was a composite created from an older image. This supports the claim that Hezbollah was involved in the image's dissemination.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Hezbollah was involved with an image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Royanews.tv reported that an image, purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone, was a composite created from an older image. This supports the claim that Hezbollah was involved in the image's dissemination.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024, the evidence suggests that the image was a composite created from an older image, and Royanews.tv reported that the image was purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone.
