DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>. The article also stated that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event <image:k>.


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland offered protection to Netanyahu, potentially related to an ICC arrest warrant.
2.  The evidence does not mention an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it state that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid such an attack.
3.  The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was not planning to attend an event in Poland.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-823797](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-823797)) reported on October 8, 2024, that Netanyahu barred Gallant's US trip <image:k>. Le Monde reported that Netanyahu said Iran made a big mistake and would pay for it ![image 10630](media/2025-08-30_07-25-1756538716-021543.jpg). CNN reported that the attack targeted Mossad headquarters, Nevatim Air Base, and Tel Nof Air Base <image:k>. The articles do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland.

2.  The evidence indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack and barred Gallant's US trip.
3.  The evidence does not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
