## Claim
Claim: "![image 43](media/71.jpg) This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor."

## Actions
```
web_search("vegetable stand Gaza Merkava tank")
geolocate(![image 43](media/71.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 43](media/71.jpg)) shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, modified into a fruit stand. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The article was published on February 3, 2025, by Elias Atienza. The Merkava tank is an Israeli main battle tank, in service since 1979. It has been used in several wars, including the Gaza War.

The Merkava Mk 4M Windbreaker, equipped with the Trophy active protection system, is shown in the image (![image 43](media/71.jpg)). Hamas has damaged and captured Merkava tanks.


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The evidence also indicates that the Merkava tank is an Israeli tank and has been used in the Gaza War.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, modified into a fruit stand. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza.

The claim is demonstrably false because the tank in the image is not a Merkava tank, and the location is not Gaza. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, used as a vegetable stand in Syria, not Gaza, as indicated by the search results ([web_search](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegetable+stand+Gaza+Merkava+tank)). The geolocation data also does not support the claim's location.
