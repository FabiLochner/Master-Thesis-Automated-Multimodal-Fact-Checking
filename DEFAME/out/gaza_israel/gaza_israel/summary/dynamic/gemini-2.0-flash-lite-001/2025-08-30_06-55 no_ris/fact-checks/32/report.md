## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The claim that Tomer Bar was killed by Hezbollah is false, according to a fact-check published on December 12, 2024, by aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html)) ![image 10194](media/2025-08-30_07-03-1756537409-588208.jpg).

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Press TV, Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted the residence of Israeli Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar in Tel Aviv with a drone attack on November 18, 2024, which was subject to censorship by Israeli authorities. (![image 10238](media/2025-08-30_07-04-1756537446-134571.jpg))

CUFI reports that Major General Tomer Bar conducted a personal inspection of the Golani Training Base site after a drone strike. (![image 10283](media/2025-08-30_07-04-1756537469-666838.jpg))

## Elaboration
The claim is false. Fact-checks from aol.com ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-israeli-general-not-150127650.html)) and Inshorts ([https://inshorts.com/en/news/israeli-air-force-chief-tomer-bar-alive--not-killed-by-hezbollah-1733746115536](https://inshorts.com/en/news/israeli-air-force-chief-tomer-bar-alive--not-killed-by-hezbollah-1733746115536)) confirm that Tomer Bar is alive.

While Press TV reports that Hеzbollаh claimed to have targeted Tomer Bar's residence in Tel Aviv with a drone attack ([https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones](https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2024/11/27/738007/Lebanon-Hezbollah-residence-Tomer-Bar-attack-drones)), this does not confirm the claim that he was killed. Furthermore, CUFI reports that Tomer Bar inspected a site after a drone strike ([https://cufi.org/issue/this-is-how-the-hezbollah-uav-evaded-detection-with-fatal-results/](https://cufi.org/issue/this-is-how-the-hezbollah-uav-evaded-detection-with-fatal-results/)), which further contradicts the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Major General Tomer Bar was killed by Hеzbollаh is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including fact-checks from aol.com and Inshorts, confirm that Tomer Bar is alive. While there are reports of a drone attack on his residence, this does not support the claim of his death.

`false`
