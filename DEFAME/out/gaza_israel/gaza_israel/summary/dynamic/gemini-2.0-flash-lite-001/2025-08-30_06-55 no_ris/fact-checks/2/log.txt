Useful result: From [Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/08/04/how-a-photo-of-a-skeletal-child-sparked-controversy-about-starvation-in-gaza): 
Content: The Euronews article, published on August 4, 2025, discusses a photo of an emaciated child in Gaza that sparked controversy about starvation in Gaza. The article mentions that the photo was published by The New York Times and other media outlets. The article also mentions that the boy in the photo, Mohammed, has a serious disorder. The article states that there is severe starvation in Gaza, as reported by reputable media outlets and humanitarian aid groups. The article also mentions that the World Health Organisation (WHO) says malnutrition in Gaza has reached "alarming levels". The article also mentions that the United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification has said that "the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip". <image:3>

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The image is digitally generated, as confirmed by multiple sources ([Source](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/), [Source](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14969115/Gaza-skeleton-Palestinian-girl-skin-bone-food-crisis-Israel-hostage-video.html), and [Source](https://news.abplive.com/fact-check/viral-image-of-gazan-woman-golding-child-s-remains-is-digitally-generated-1760363)), making the claim that it is an authentic image false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
