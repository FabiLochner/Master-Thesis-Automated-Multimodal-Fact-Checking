Content: The NBC News article discusses Israel's ban on UNRWA in Palestinian territories. <image:10235>

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Multiple fact-checking sources, including [DW](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996), [The Canadian Press News](https://www.thecanadianpressnews.ca/fact_checking/black-band-on-unrwas-social-media-profiles-appeared-before-yahya-sinwars-death/article_33032eb2-f64b-55c6-8a57-3289e6a014cf.html), and PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5](https://pesacheck.org/false-unrwa-didnt-update-its-profile-photo-to-mourn-the-death-of-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-f8219db942b5)), confirm that the black ribbon on UNRWA's profile picture predates Yahya Sinwar's death and was not related to his death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
