Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-israeli-tanks-spotted-outside-damascus-a-fact-check-7224391): 
Content: NDTV fact-checked a claim that Israeli tanks were near Damascus. The image in the claim is the same as the one in the search result. The search result states that the claim is false. The search result was published on December 10, 2024. <image:10554>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on December 8, 2024, about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights. The article includes an image of an Israeli tank. <image:10555>

The claim '<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image depicts Israeli tanks, the evidence from [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/were-israeli-tanks-spotted-outside-damascus-a-fact-check-7224391) and other sources indicates that the tanks were near Damascus, not in the city, and the claim misrepresents the situation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
