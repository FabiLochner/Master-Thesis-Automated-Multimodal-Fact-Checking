Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/27/barcelona-fans-banned-for-one-champions-league-game-for-nazi-style-flag-football): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on September 27, 2024, reporting that FC Barcelona was banned from selling tickets to fans for their next away game in the Champions League due to a banner with Nazi overtones displayed during a match against Monaco. <image:1>.

The claim '<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image could be from February 2023, the claim's date of September 2024 is plausible, as Barcelona's actions regarding Israel were discussed around that time, and the Israeli-Hamas conflict was ongoing, as reported by [AOL](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-fc-barcelona-183038240.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
