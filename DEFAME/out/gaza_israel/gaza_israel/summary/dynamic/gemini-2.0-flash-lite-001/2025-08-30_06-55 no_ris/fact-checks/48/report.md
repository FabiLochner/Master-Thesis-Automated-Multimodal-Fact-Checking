## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (![image 4075](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909974-533843.jpg)). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/).

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (![image 4080](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909982-447907.jpg), ![image 4081](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909983-160119.jpg), ![image 4081](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909983-160119.jpg)). The article states that Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. The article mentions that PBS host Judy Woodruff said that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. The article was updated on August 22, 2024, and can be found here: [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248). NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (![image 4093](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909991-227394.jpg), ![image 4092](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909989-387454.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention the specific reason Trump gave Netanyahu for stopping the deal. The Newsweek article mentions allegations that Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is not fully supported. While there is evidence of a phone call and discussion about the ceasefire, there is conflicting information about the specific reasons Trump gave Netanyahu.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump and Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign is not fully supported. While Newsweek reported on allegations of this, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. Additional searches about Trump and Harris' positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict do not mention the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire): 
Content: The New Republic reports that Donald Trump allegedly spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu to avert a ceasefire deal, fearing it would help Kamala Harris win in November. PBS reported that Trump was urging Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help the Harris campaign. Both Netanyahu's office and Trump denied the report. The article was published on August 20, 2024.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms that Trump and Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign is based on allegations. Both Trump and Netanyahu denied the report.


## Final Judgement
The claim is based on allegations that are denied by both Trump and Netanyahu. While there is evidence of a phone call and discussion about the ceasefire, the specific reason Trump gave Netanyahu is not fully supported.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported. While there is evidence of a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing the Gaza ceasefire, the assertion that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign is based on allegations that both Trump and Netanyahu denied, as reported by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248) and [The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/185076/donald-trump-scheme-beat-kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-ceasefire).
