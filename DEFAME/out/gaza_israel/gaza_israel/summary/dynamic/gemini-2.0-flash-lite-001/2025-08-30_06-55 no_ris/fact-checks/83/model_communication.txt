Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")

While largely symbolic, the action by Spain’s second-largest city adds to mounting criticism of Israel’s conduct in Gaza. Spain will continue to raise its voice, stronger than ever, to end the massacre the world is witnessing today,” Sánchez posted on X earlier this week.

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to sever official ties with the Israeli government and suspend its 1998 friendship agreement with Tel Aviv. The move comes during Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, which has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the Spanish government.

The motion was backed by the governing Socialist party and supported by far-left and pro-independence factions. It calls for cutting all institutional relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored. In recent months, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has repeatedly accused Israel of violating international law and using disproportionate force, warning that its military campaign risks destabilizing the region.

“A year after recognizing Palestine as a state, the pain in Gaza is unbearable."

In late May, Collboni’s Socialist-led council voted to cut “all institutional ties with the current Israeli government until human rights in Gaza are respected,” reversing his own September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties, which had been severed by his predecessor Ada Colau.

The council’s move included economic steps to block cooperation with companies linked to Israel, as identified by the UN for alleged illegal operations in territories harming Palestinian rights, economy, society and culture. It also directed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged Barcelona’s port to deny docking to ships carrying arms to Israel.

Barcelona mayor cancels trip to Israel amid entry ban
=====================================================

22 August 2025 16:42

**Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni on August 22, two months after his city council cut all institutional ties with the Israeli government and ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.**

Collboni, who had planned to visit Yad Vashem and the Palestinian Authority, cancelled his trip following the refusal, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3q42skex)
** Israeli media.

His entry request through the ETA system, which pre-screens travellers from visa-exempt countries, was rejected due to his anti-Israel statements. It also instructed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged the city’s port to deny docking to ships transporting arms to Israel.

The move mirrors Spain’s position among 21 nations condemning Israel’s E1 plan in Ma’ale Adumim, which disrupts Palestinian territorial continuity between Ramallah and Bethlehem and has been described as a potential “death knell” for a Palestinian state.

The event occurred after Barcelona ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the image could be from February 2023, when Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag. However, the claim states the image is from September 2024. The evidence also mentions that in September 2024, Barcelona reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible, but the evidence does not confirm the image's date.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information to confirm the image's date and the context of the event.

The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)) and i24NEWS ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)) reported that FC Barcelona's president Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag by Israeli diplomats in February 2023 (<image:1>, <image:10638>). The event occurred after Barcelona ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.

FC Barcelona's website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel)) reported that Joan Laporta met with the president of Israel Isaac Herzog on July 18, 2021 (<image:10640>, <image:10639>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Media Line published an article on May 31, 2025, discussing Barcelona's decision to cut ties with the Israeli government due to the ongoing war in Gaza, and mentions a pro-Palestine march in Barcelona in February 2024 (<image:10647>, <image:10648>). Ynet News discusses the Barcelona mayor's visit to Israel being denied due to his anti-Israel stance and the city council's decision to sever ties with the Israeli government, reversing a September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties (<image:10650>).

Caliber.Az reported on August 22, 2025, that Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni due to his anti-Israel statements, and that in September 2024, Collboni's council reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image could be from February 2023, when Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag. However, the claim states the image is from September 2024. The evidence also mentions that in September 2024, Barcelona reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible, but the evidence does not confirm the image's date.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information to confirm the image's date and the context of the event.

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing alleged violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, called for an end to all official relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with the liberal coastal city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organizer Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

“The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable,” Barcelona’s Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

It was not the first time Barcelona had moved to suspend ties with Israel.

In 2023, then-mayor Ada Colau took similar steps, which were later reversed when Collboni won local elections.

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain’s second-largest city — a top tourist destination and home to one of the world’s best-known football clubs — adds to a growing list of critics of Israel amid the devastating war in Gaza.

Barcelona’s move came a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel’s military operations in Gaza amid the war sparked by the Hamas terror group’s devastating attack on October 7, 2023.

Barcelona lost their opening Champions League match of the season 2-1 against Monaco \[David Ramos/Getty Images\]

Published On 27 Sep 202427 Sep 2024

UEFA has banned Barcelona from selling tickets to fans for its next away game in the Champions League for displaying a banner with Nazi overtones about the team’s new German coach.

A black flag with the words “Flick Heil” in apparent tribute to coach Hansi Flick was displayed during a 2-1 loss at Monaco last week.

UEFA said on Friday the club was charged with “racism and/or other discriminatory conduct,” and the disciplinary sanction will apply on November 6 when Barcelona plays at Red Star Belgrade.

The ticket sales ban activated a UEFA-ordered probationary sanction against Barcelona last season. ![BARCELONA, SPAIN - APRIL 05: A club crest is seen prior to the UEFA Champions League quarter final first leg match between FC Barcelona and Club Atletico de Madrid at Camp Nou on April 5, 2016 in Barcelona, Spain. In April, fans made Nazi salutes at Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League game.

UEFA said its disciplinary judges also fined Barcelona $11,000 and ordered a new probationary sanction for a repeat offence in the next year. That will activate another ticket sales ban for one away game in a European competition.

The defeat at Monaco was the only blip in Barcelona’s season with victories recorded in all seven of their Spanish top-flight matches."

Al Jazeera reported on September 27, 2024 ([https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/27/barcelona-fans-banned-for-one-champions-league-game-for-nazi-style-flag-football](https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/9/27/barcelona-fans-banned-for-one-champions-league-game-for-nazi-style-flag-football)), that FC Barcelona was banned from selling tickets to fans for their next away game in the Champions League. <image:10687> <image:10725> <image:1>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the claim's date, September 2024, is plausible, as the information about Barcelona's actions regarding Israel was circulating around that time. The AOL fact-check explicitly mentions the ongoing Israeli-Hamas conflict, supporting the claim that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)) and i24NEWS ([https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel)) reported that FC Barcelona's president Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag by Israeli diplomats in February 2023 (<image:1>, <image:10638>). The event occurred after Barcelona ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.

FC Barcelona's website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel)) reported that Joan Laporta met with the president of Israel Isaac Herzog on July 18, 2021 (<image:10640>, <image:10639>).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The Media Line published an article on May 31, 2025, discussing Barcelona's decision to cut ties with the Israeli government due to the ongoing war in Gaza, and mentions a pro-Palestine march in Barcelona in February 2024 (<image:10647>, <image:10648>). Ynet News discusses the Barcelona mayor's visit to Israel being denied due to his anti-Israel stance and the city council's decision to sever ties with the Israeli government, reversing a September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties (<image:10650>).

Caliber.Az reported on August 22, 2025, that Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni due to his anti-Israel statements, and that in September 2024, Collboni's council reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image could be from February 2023, when Joan Laporta was presented with an Israeli flag. However, the claim states the image is from September 2024. The evidence also mentions that in September 2024, Barcelona reversed a decision to restore ties with Tel Aviv. Therefore, the claim's date is plausible, but the evidence does not confirm the image's date.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the Gaza war was ongoing in September 2024.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information to confirm the image's date and the context of the event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.8, 'Italy': 0.09, 'Albania': 0.01, 'Bulgaria': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Netherlands': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The image search results show images of people in orange jackets in rubble. One image from [Source](https://www.komu.com/news/nationworld/i-couldnt-save-my-daughter-behind-the-defining-image-of-the-turkey-earthquake/article_4f2535b7-4c55-5ecd-a894-03eecbcea3cf.html) shows a man in an orange jacket in rubble <image:10736>. Another result from [Source](https://www.freepik.com/premium-ai-image/three-men-orange-jackets-are-standing-rubble-area_270908906.htm) shows three men in orange jackets in a rubble area <image:10737>.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was taken in Turkey, not Gaza. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Turkey. The image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically mentioning the Turkey earthquake.

The claim that the image depicts a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024 is not supported by the evidence. The evidence points to the image being related to the Turkey earthquake.

The claim is therefore false.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Since the evidence does not directly link the individuals in the image to the attack, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the identities of the children and their involvement in the incident. `not enough information`

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.


## Actions
```

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza, which killed at least 16 people (<image:10757>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:10758>). The UNRWA website does not contain any relevant information.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.


## Actions
```

The UNRWA Media Advisor Adnan Abu Hasna told Al Jazeera he estimated that the number of displaced people sheltering at the school stood at 2000 however this figure was far too low according to other experts on the ground.

Director of Logistics at Civil Defense told Al Jazeera that the number of families at the school was 1,200 with around 7000 people.

### Support Countercurrents

Countercurrents is answerable only to our readers. At least 16 people were killed in this latest massacre at a UN school that was previously announced as a safe area by the Israeli military.

https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1809622090565251139

Some of the victims were displaced people from Khan Younis ordered to leave from there by the Israeli military.

* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background.

The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera reports on an Israeli attack on a UN school used as a shelter in Gaza, which killed at least 16 people (<image:10757>). Le Monde reports on an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza that wiped out a shelter in an UNRWA school (<image:10758>). The UNRWA website does not contain any relevant information.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.

On 6 June 2024, the [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 fired two missiles at Al-Sardi, a [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 school in the [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
. Israel had previously been criticized during the offensive for the offensive itself and airstrikes conducted by Israel, such as the [Tel Al-Sultan attack](/w/index.php?title=Tel_Al-Sultan_attack&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tel Al-Sultan attack (page does not exist)")
, in which 45–50 Palestinian civilians were killed in an area designated a "safe zone" for civilians in the [Gaza Strip](/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")
.[\[11\]](#cite_note-:5-11)
 UNRWA said 6,000 Palestinian refugees were sheltering in the school at the time of the attack.[\[12\]](#cite_note-Reuters2-12)
 Since the start of the war, more than 180 UN agency buildings have been hit and more than 450 displaced people have been killed in those facilities.[\[13\]](#cite_note-13)

Attack
------

On 6 June 2024, at approximately 2 am,[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)
[\[15\]](#cite_note-Sbair-15)
 Israeli forces targeted the classrooms on the highest floor of the Al-Sardi school in the Nuseirat refugee camp with two missiles in an airstrike.[\[2\]](#cite_note-bbc4-2)
 The strike was carried after the army declared new ground assaults and airstrikes on several refugee camps in central Gaza.[\[16\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera1-16)
 The munition used in the attack was of the same variety employed in the Tel al-Sultan attack, namely a [GBU-39](/wiki/GBU-39_Small_Diameter_Bomb "GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb")
.[\[14\]](#cite_note-EstrinBaba-14)

Casualties
----------

UNRWA said 35 people had been killed, based on testimony of its employees at the school.[\[3\]](#cite_note-bbc_us-3)

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The claim presents an image and identifies the individuals as Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were allegedly killed by Israel. The claim also provides the date and location of the incident. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information to verify the claim.

I need additional information to verify the claim, such as news reports, official statements, or other sources that confirm the identities of the individuals, the circumstances of their deaths, and the involvement of Israel.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that an Israeli attack occurred on a UN school in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp, resulting in casualties. Al Jazeera reports at least 16 deaths. Le Monde also reports on an Israeli airstrike on an UNRWA school in central Gaza. However, the evidence does not explicitly mention Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida or confirm their deaths in this specific incident.

To verify the claim, I need to find a source that directly links Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida to the attack on the UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024.
