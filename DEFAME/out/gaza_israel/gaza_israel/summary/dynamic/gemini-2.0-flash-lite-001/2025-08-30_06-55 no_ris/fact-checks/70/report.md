On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, codenamed Operation True Promise II, involving approximately 200 ballistic missiles (<image:i>, <image:k>, ![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The Israeli military reported intercepting a large number of the projectiles, with the US military coordinating to shoot them down as well. Iran claimed 90% of its missiles hit their targets, a claim disputed by Israel. The attack resulted in minor damage and two fatalities.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, involving approximately 200 ballistic missiles. The Israeli military, along with the US military, intercepted a large number of these projectiles. However, the evidence does not specify the exact percentage of missiles intercepted by the Iron Dome.

The claim states that the Iron Dome intercepted 90% of the missiles. The provided sources do not confirm this specific interception rate.

To verify the claim, I need information on the Iron Dome's interception rate during the October 1, 2024, attack.
