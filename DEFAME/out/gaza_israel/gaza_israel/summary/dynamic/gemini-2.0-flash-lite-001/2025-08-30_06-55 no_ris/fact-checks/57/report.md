## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.avapress.com/en/article/326644/the-voice-will-not-be-silenced): 
Content: The search result from Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) - International Service, published on August 27, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis that killed 4 journalists and cameramen. The article also mentions a list of 50 Palestinian journalists who were martyred during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025, including Ibrahim Muhareb. ![image 32](media/57.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence mentions an Israeli airstrike and a list of martyred journalists, including Ibrahim Muhareb. The image is included in the article. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the baby in the image is Sham Imad Muhareb, nor does it confirm the details of the injury.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm the baby's identity and the circumstances of her injuries.

The image is included in the article. ![image 32](media/57.jpg)

Quds News Network ([https://t.me/s/QudsNen?before=158681](https://t.me/s/QudsNen?before=158681)) reports that Sham Imad Muhareb sustained critical injuries in an Israeli bombing, resulting in the amputation of her right hand. ![image 10450](media/2025-08-30_07-13-1756538033-690073.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates conflicting information. One source states that Sham Imad Muhareb sustained critical injuries in an Israeli bombing, resulting in the amputation of her right hand. However, the image provided does not show a missing arm. The claim is therefore not entirely accurate.


## Final Judgement
The evidence reveals conflicting information. While one source states that Sham Imad Muhareb lost her right hand in an Israeli bombing, the image provided does not depict this injury. The image is included in articles about the conflict, but the claim's specific details about the baby's injuries are not fully supported by the available evidence.

The claim is partially inaccurate because the image does not show the baby having lost her arm, as the claim states. The evidence provides conflicting information about the baby's injuries. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While the image is associated with Sham Imad Muhareb and the Gaza conflict, the evidence, including a report from Quds News Network, indicates that she lost her right hand in an Israeli bombing, which is not visible in the image.
