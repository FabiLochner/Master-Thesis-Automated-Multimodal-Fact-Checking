Content: Myth Detector fact-checked a fabricated quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson, which included an image of him with the Israeli flag. <image:10779>

The claim '<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.' is false.
Justification: The image of Dwayne Johnson holding the Israeli flag is a fabricated image, as confirmed by a fact-check from Myth Detector ([https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/)). While Johnson has expressed support for Israel, the specific image is not authentic.

So, the overall veracity is: false
