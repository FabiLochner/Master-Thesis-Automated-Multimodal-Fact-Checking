## Actions
```
web_search("DNA testing legality Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard Kennedy School of Government published an article, "Genetic citizenship: DNA testing and the Israeli Law of Return," which examines the use of genetic tests to determine Jewish identity for immigration purposes in Israel (<image:k> [Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)). Another article from Harvard University discusses the use of genetic tests to determine if potential immigrants are Jewish, published in 2015 (<image:k> [Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)). Nature.com discusses a bill proposing stringent restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel, passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee (<image:k> [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)).


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Instead, it is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewish identity for immigration.
2.  The evidence mentions a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information, implying that the use of genetic information is regulated, not prohibited.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. Instead, it is used in specific contexts, such as determining Jewish identity for immigration, and there are regulations on the use of genetic information.

The claim is demonstrably false as the evidence from multiple sources indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government ([Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)) and other sources indicates that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for determining Jewish identity for immigration, and that there are regulations on the use of genetic information, not a prohibition on testing.
