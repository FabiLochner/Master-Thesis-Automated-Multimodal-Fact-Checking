Content: ABC News published an image of an Israeli helicopter. <image:7860>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/counter-drone-helicopters-israel-ukraine-air-defenses-2024-11): 
Content: Business Insider published an article in November 2024 about counter-drone helicopters, including an image of an Israeli helicopter <image:7861>.

The claim '<image:6> This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. Reverse image search did not yield any results for the image. While there have been clashes between Hezbollah and Israel, and incidents involving helicopters, there is no evidence to support the specific claim that the image depicts an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah on November 23, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
