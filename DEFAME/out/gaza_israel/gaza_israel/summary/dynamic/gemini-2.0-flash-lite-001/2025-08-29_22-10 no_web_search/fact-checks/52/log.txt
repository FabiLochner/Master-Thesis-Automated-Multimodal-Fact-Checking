The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675), indicate significant displacement of over one million people from Gaza since October 7, 2023, suggesting a population decrease, not an increase. While a [Statista graph](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1422981/gaza-total-population/) shows overall population growth over time, it lacks the specific data needed to verify the claim's percentage increase.

So, the overall veracity is: false
