The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The evidence suggests that DNA testing is performed in Israel and is used in the context of immigration, as indicated by sources like [this one](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/). However, the provided information does not explicitly state whether it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
