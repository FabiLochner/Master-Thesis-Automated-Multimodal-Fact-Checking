* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

Content: The Economist published an article on July 19, 2024, stating that the World Court says Israel's occupation is illegal. <image:7878>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the International Court of Justice (World Court) stated that Israel's occupation is illegal. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israel has been declared an illegal state.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The evidence confirms the ICJ's ruling on the illegality of the occupation, but it does not confirm the declaration of Israel as an illegal state.

The claim is not fully verified.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Express-Times Photo | TIM WYNKOOPThe New Jersey State Fire Marshal's office this morning is investigating the cause of Tuesday night's fire and explosion at the Linde North America plant in Alpha.

A massive explosion that rocked an Alpha gas and chemical facility Tuesday night was caused by a fire in an outdoor area used to store various sizes of chemical and gas containers, officials said.

The cause of the fire, which started about 10:30 p.m. at a plant owned and operated by Linde North America, is unknown and is still being investigated this morning.

No injuries were reported in the blaze, said Pohatcong Township-based Huntington Volunteer Fire Co. Chief Pete Pursell. He said the fire took crews about an hour and a half to quell.

The fire [prompted warnings to residents in a mile radius to shut their windows and stay inside](http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/2011/04/alpha_haz-mat_fire_prompts_war.html)
. Warren County emergency officials performed air tests and said [there were no health issues associated with the fire](http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/phillipsburg/index.ssf/2011/04/no_injuries_no_health_risk_aft.html)
.

Pohatcong Township Police Chief Paul Hager said evacuations were not necessary for any of the surrounding homes or businesses.

Kristina Schurr, spokeswoman for Linde North America, said employees noticed smoke, called the fire department and activated the company's emergency response plan. The 23 people working Tuesday night were immediately ushered from the plant.

Express-Times Photo | TIM WYNKOOPAn explosion Tuesday night at Linde Electronics and Specialty Gas in Alpha fire sends a fireball into the sky.

Pursell said crews were initially called for a report of a building fire, but arrived to find a giant fireball erupting from the company grounds.

Pursell said his crews quickly directed giant streams of water toward the flames to knock them down. As the heat and flames subsided, the firefighters advanced and shot foam at nearby chemical tanks to cool them, Pursell said.

Schurr said one explosion was from a container that held a citrus-based solvent, but the company and the New Jersey fire marshal's office are searching for the cause of the initial fire. The solvent inside the container is not flammable.

Pursell said it appeared that a chemical reaction heated up some tractor-trailer tires, which exploded and were consumed in the fire. He did not know the cause of the fire.

The plant sustained limited damage because the fire was outdoors, Schurr said, adding that the plant is still fully operational.

The company makes fine chemicals, high-purity gases and gas-handling equipment for industrial use.

Pursell said his department has responded to about four gas-related incidents at the plant in the past 10 years.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes images of attacks in Baghdad, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results show a burning car and a damaged facility, but not the explosion depicted in the claim. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the details of the event it depicts.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of attacks in Baghdad, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results show a burning car and a damaged facility, but not the explosion depicted in the claim. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the image's origin and the details of the event it depicts.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that the image in the claim does not match any of the images found in the search results. The search results include images of attacks in Baghdad, but none of them match the explosion depicted in the claim.

Since the image cannot be verified with the provided evidence, the claim is not supported. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `not enough information`.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image search confirms that there are images related to Palestine in Montreal. The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine, with a smaller probability of being in Canada. The evidence does not provide information about the traffic sign's message or the authorization by Montreal's Mayor.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza."

## Actions
```
image_search("Keir Starmer Israel boycott Gaza October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on October 7, 2024, about Keir Starmer's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict (<image:7931>). Novara Media published an article on July 3, 2024, about Keir Starmer and Palestine (<image:7932>).

The Times of Israel published an image of Keir Starmer (<image:7933>).


## Elaboration
The evidence shows that Keir Starmer's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict was discussed in an article published by The Guardian on October 7, 2024. However, the evidence does not provide any information about whether Starmer said the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

image_search("IHRA working definition antisemitism")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The World Jewish Congress has a page about the "Working Definition of Antisemitism" (<image:7948>). The search results also contain an image of the definition of antisemitism (<image:7949>). The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopted a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism on May 26, 2016 (<image:7950>).

### Evidence from `image_search`

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that he postponed a visit, and an NPR article from November 5, 2024, also features an image of him. The claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024, is therefore false.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
image_search("Yoav Gallant October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on October 8, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant postponed a visit to Washington (<image:7972>). Al Jazeera published an article about Benjamin Netanyahu firing Yoav Gallant, including an image of Netanyahu and Gallant (<image:7973>).

An NPR article, published on November 5, 2024, features an image of Yoav Gallant (<image:7974>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024. Reuters reported on October 8, 2024, that he postponed a visit, and an NPR article from November 5, 2024, also features an image of him. The claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024, is therefore false.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence shows that Yoav Gallant was alive after October 1, 2024, as he was mentioned in news articles published on October 8 and November 5, 2024. This contradicts the claim that he was killed on October 1, 2024.

From [Source](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/): Found exact image on website with title: US takes out al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
Content: "Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed while standing on the balcony of his safe house in Afghanistan when a CIA drone sent two Hellfire missiles to pulverize the terror leader and plotter of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The precision strike took place in the heart of downtown Kabul during the early hours Saturday, ending a 21-year manhunt for Osama bin Laden’s successor and marking the most significant US counterterror operation since the 2019 slaying of ISIS commander Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The terror leader had stepped onto his balcony in the Shirpur neighborhood of Kabul when the US drone fired two specially designed RX9 Hellfire missiles dubbed “sword bombs” due to the blades that allow the weapon to tear through metal and walls without destroying entire structures.

President Biden confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death during an evening address in which he declared, “Justice has been delivered and this terrorist leader is no more.”

“Now we make it clear again tonight, that no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide: If you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out,” Biden said.

Biden said of al-Zawahiri, “For decades, he was the mastermind behind the attacks against Americans, including the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 American sailors and wounded dozens more.”

“He played a key role, a key role in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 and wounding over 4,500 others. He carved a trail of murder and violence against American citizens, American service members, American diplomats and American interests.”

 [!Map of drone strike <image:7049> 7](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/kabul-strike-new.jpg "Open a slideshow of all 7 article images.")

The drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death near Kabul.

None of al-Zawahiri’s family members were hurt and there were no civilian casualties, the president said, calling the mission to eliminate the terrorist leader a “total success.”

The president also warned: “To those around the world who have continued to seek to harm the United States, hear me now: We will always remain vigilant and we will act and we will always do what is necessary to ensure the safety and security of Americans at home and around the globe.”

Biden’s remarks from the Blue Room balcony of the White House were reminiscent of President Barack Obama’s late-night announcement of the death of bin Laden in Pakistan more than 11 years ago.

“After relentlessly seeking Zawahiri for years under Presidents \[George W.\] Bush, Obama and \[Donald\] Trump, our intelligence community located Zawahiri earlier this year,” Biden said.

“He had moved to downtown Kabul to reunite with members of his immediate family. After carefully considering the clear and convincing evidence of his location, I authorized a precision strike to remove him from the battlefield once and for all.

“This mission was carefully planned and rigorously to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians. And one week ago, after being advised the conditions were optimal, I gave the final approval to go get him.”

Biden added: “We will never again, never again allow Afghanistan to become a terrorist safe haven because he is gone. And we’re going to make sure that nothing else happens.”

“You know, it can’t be a launching pad against the United States. We’re gonna see to it that won’t happen,” he said.

“This operation is a clear demonstration that we will, we can and will always make good on that solid, solid pledge.

Fox News, citing two intelligence sources, first reported on the death of the Egyptian-born surgeon who took over the terrorist group behind the Sept. 11 attacks after bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in 2011.

Al-Zawahiri had a $25 million bounty on his head over his indictment in the 1998 embassy bombings.

He’s also believed to have helped coordinate the atrocities that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Shanksville, Pa., 21 years ago, which were masterminded by bin Laden and planned by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, pending trial by a military tribunal.

Current and former officials began hearing Sunday afternoon that he’d been killed in a drone strike, sources told the Associated Press, but the administration delayed releasing the information until his death could be confirmed.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid [confirmed in a statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1554187982407696387)
 Monday that a drone strike on a home in Kabul had taken place the day before.

The house was owned by a top aide to senior Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, a senior intelligence official told AP, raising questions about whether al-Zawahiri had received sanctuary from the Islamist group following the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.

The official added that a CIA ground team and aerial reconnaissance conducted after the drone strike confirmed al-Zawahiri’s death.

A senior Biden administration official noted: “Haqqani Taliban members took actions after the strike to conceal Zawahiri’s former presence at the location.”

“We have identified a concerted effort to restrict access to the safe house in the surrounding area for hours after the strike,” the official said.

“The safe house used by Zawahiri is now empty.”

The Taliban spokesman said, “The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan strongly condemns this attack on any pretext and calls it a clear violation of international principles and the Doha Agreement.

“Such actions are a repetition of the failed experiences of the past 20 years and are against the interests of the United States of America, Afghanistan and the region,” Zabihullah wrote.

“Repeating such actions will damage the available opportunities.”

Al-Zawahiri ascended in al Qaeda after bin Laden was killed in 2011. AP

Al-Zawahiri and bin Laden are believed to have met in the late 1980s, when al-Zawahiri reportedly treated the Saudi millionaire in the caves of Afghanistan as Soviet bombardments shook the mountains around them.

Al-Zawahiri merged his group of Egyptian militants with bin Laden’s al Qaeda in the 1990s, and photos from that period often showed the two men sitting side by side.

Bin Laden provided al Qaeda with charisma and money, but al-Zawahiri brought tactics and organizational skills needed to forge militants into a network of cells in countries around the world.

“The strong contingent of Egyptians \[in al Qaeda\] applied organizational know-how, financial expertise, and military experience to wage a violent jihad against leaders whom the fighters considered to be un-Islamic and their patrons, especially the United States,” Steven A. Cook wrote for the Council on Foreign Relations last year.

There have been rumors of al-Zawahiri’s death for several years, but a video that surfaced in April showed him praising an Indian Muslim woman who had defied a ban on wearing a hijab, or headscarf.

That footage was the first proof in months that he was still alive.

As with bin Laden, al-Zawahiri’s whereabouts had been unknown before the operation that led to his death, though the most common rumors placed him either in Afghanistan or in Pakistan’s near-lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border.

The US planned to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri over a period of several months. On July 31, 2022, two Hellfire missiles fired using a US drone ended the life of the al-Qaeda chief while he was sitting outside in his balcony, mincing him into shreds but without any damage to other individuals.

The CIA officials who were involved in the mission, according to _the Associated Press_, constructed “a pattern of life" and knew that Ayman al-Zawahiri liked sitting on the balcony of his building, which is located in Kabul’s Sherpur area.

Once his daily routine was established by the officials, they presented it to US president Joe Biden in the White House’s Situation Room weeks before the attack.

The officials were also aware that the Haqqani Taliban network provided the housing to Ayman al-Zawahiri and his family in Kabul. The AP reported that Zawahiri’s family along with him started living in the house once the Taliban took over Kabul in August 2021.

! <image:7069>

People familiar with the developments told _CNNNews18_ that the building is close to Iranian and Turkish embassies.

After the US officials confirmed these details, they took more months to formulate an action plan. Several independent teams of analysts were brought on board to ensure that nearby civilians and infrastructure should not be targeted.

! <image:7070>

Another official familiar with the developments said that the now deceased al-Qaeda leader’s identity was verified on multiple occasions and for sustained periods of time before getting approval for the attack.

The plans were first formed in early April when two senior national security officials were first briefed on the intelligence. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan was then apprised of the developments. Over the next two months, a small group of officials of the US government vetted the intel and devised options for US president Biden.

Biden, when apprised of the developments in July, shortly after he returned from his Europe trip, bombarded CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and National Counterterrorism Centre director Christy Abizaid regarding the accuracy of the data presented to him.

Biden made it clear that the attack should not lead to results like the 2021 drone attack that ended up killing civilians in Kabul. He also said that Afghans who helped the US should not be in jeopardy.

Biden gave the go-ahead after July 25, while he was recovering from Covid .

The success of the attack was confirmed when the Haqqani Taliban network restricted access to the safe house and relocated Zawahiri’s family.

“I authorized the precision strike that would remove him from the battlefield once and for all. This measure was carefully planned, rigorously, to minimize the risk of harm to other civilians," Biden said in his address where he confirmed that the al-Qaeda leader, who headed the terrorist group for more than a decade, was eliminated.

The house where Al-Qaeda emir Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed, 31 July 2022

Ayman al-Zawahiri, the 71-year-old emir of Al-Qaeda, was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, on 31 July 2022—one year ago today. Al-Zawahiri’s long life involved in Islamic militancy is interesting in itself, and can tell us a lot about where the jihadist movement is and where it is trending, notably his intellectual evolution towards a more “localist” program and the clash with the Islamic State, and perhaps even more immediately—in terms of his successor as Al-Qaeda’s leader—the relationships Al-Zawahiri fostered with various States, specifically Pakistan and Iran.

**JIHAD AT HOME**


-------------------

Al-Zawahiri was born in Cairo, Egypt, on 19 June 1951 to a [prominent elite family](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
: one of his great-uncles, Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, was the first general-secretary of the Arab League between 1945 and 1952, and his grandfather, Rabia al-Zawahiri, had been the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, once the most prestigious institution in the Sunni world before it became a drab adjunct of the military regime. Al-Zawahiri got involved with Islamic militancy early in his life, [joining](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism)
 the Muslim Brotherhood in 1965 while he was at school, aged 14. Al-Zawahiri’s ideological devotion cannot be doubted: this was at the nadir for Egypt’s Islamists—albeit this turned out, as he had no way of knowing, to be the darkness before the dawn.

The Brotherhood and like-minded groups had welcomed the military coup in July 1952 that liquidated the gentle Western-aligned monarchy, hoping that it would lead to Islamic government. It swiftly became apparent they had miscalculated: pan-Arabism would be the creed of the new order. In 1954, the Soviet-aligned ruler, Gamal Abdel Nasser, initiated a severe crackdown on the Brotherhood that [they call](https://eeradicalization.com/the-history-and-ideology-of-the-muslim-brotherhood-an-interview-with-joas-wagemakers/)
 the _mihna_ (inquisition). The Brotherhood’s leading ideologue, Sayyid Qutb, was arrested at this time, accused (probably correctly) of trying to assassinate Nasser. Qutb was released in May 1964, but [arrested again](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
 in August 1965, accused of trying to overthrow the government. 17,000 Islamists were [swept up](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in the 1965-66 crackdown. In August 1966, Qutb was sent to the gallows.

The Islamists, however, were on the eve of an event that would hand them victory in the struggle with the pan-Arabists. Perhaps the central organising principle of pan-Arabism was the intention to uproot the Zionist project. The Arab States tried, after the restoration of Israel in 1948, to, in the infamous phrase of the era, “[throw the Jews into the sea](https://aijac.org.au/australia-israel-review/scribblings-a-sea-change/)
”. They failed, but the war continued by other means, with efforts to economically suffocate the Jewish State, a cross-border terrorist campaign,[1](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-1-135614300)
 and political warfare, notably via the [Palestine Liberation Organisation](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-palestinians-and-the-plo/)
 (PLO) after 1964, an instrument that would in due course [pass to the Soviets](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/why-putins-regime-says-jews-are-the)
. In June 1967, Nasser—in collaboration with Syria and Jordan—[made a play](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/nasser-s-speech-to-the-egyptian-national-assembly-may-1967)
 to “deal with the entire Palestine Question”. Nasser’s failure was no less calamitous than 1948-49. The Israelis pre-empted the attack and pan-Arabism was shattered alongside the armies of the two radical republics, Egypt and Syria.

If Islamism was not quite born on the seventh day of the Six-Day War, it was then that it began to [move into the mainstream](https://www.commentary.org/articles/bernard-lewis/the-return-of-islam/)
. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, a course had been set for reform and various ideas imported from Europe—Nazism, Communism, nationalism—were tried towards that end. All had only made things worse. The Islamist narrative that it was this ethos of foreign-inspired change that was at fault, that the answer was to return to the indigenous faith, always had its plausibility and appeal—and spoke in a language most could understand, rather than in the alien terms of imported Western ideologies. Now it appeared a verdict had been rendered from heaven.

History was breaking the Islamists’ way. In September 1970, Nasser, their great tormentor, died, and his successor, Anwar al-Sadat, had bigger problems. Egypt was being colonised from within by the Soviet Union. In 1972, Al-Sadat [ordered](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/why-sadat-packed-off-the-russians-egypt.html)
 the Soviet intelligence “advisers” and troops out. In the shadow of the 1968 [Soviet invasion of its dissident Czechoslovak colony](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/socialism-could-never-have-a-human)
, there was no guarantee the Soviets would leave. The Soviets decided to comply, but initiated an active measures campaign to destabilise Al-Sadat’s regime, including a subversion offensive through Egypt’s internal Communist activists and agents.[2](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-2-135614300)
 To counter the Left, Al-Sadat tilted towards the Islamists: he would style himself “the Believing President”,[3](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-3-135614300)
 and, after the Brotherhood [formally renounced](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-115hhrg31367/html/CHRG-115hhrg31367.htm)
 violence, it began various forms of cooperation with the State. Many Islamists were released from prison, including, in October 1971, [Muhammad Qutb](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/publication/kiyo/pdf/2015/bulletin_e2015_6.pdf)
, who built on his brother’s ideas to [develop concepts later taken on](https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/06/13/sectarianism-of-islamic-state-ideological-roots-and-political-context/j1iy)
 by the jihadi-Salafists.

This caused some splintering among the Islamists, as more radical factions broke away from the Brotherhood to form clearly anti-State organisations—some of which [also received Soviet support](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/)
. Probably the most powerful of these groups at the time was the **Islamic Group (**_**Jamaat al-Islamiyya**_**)**. Another, which Al-Zawahiri joined in 1973, was **Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ)**. The Jamaat and EIJ were rivals to an extent, though they often collaborated. Umar Abd al-Rahman, “the Blind Shaykh”, would become firmly associated with the Jamaat a decade later, but in the mid-1970s the nature of these networks made his [allegiances rather more fluid](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 and, even after the 1980s, EIJ set great store by Abd al-Rahman as a spiritual guide.

Al-Zawahiri, who had earned his medical degree in 1974 from Cairo University, was involved in the [Military Technical College revolt](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/11/2002115486/-1/-1/0/21AYMANALZAWAHIRI.PDF)
 in 1975. In 1978, Al-Zawahiri [gained](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13789286)
 a surgical master’s degree.

The **Islamic Revolution in Iran** reached its crescendo in late 1978, right as Al-Sadat was signing the peace accords that made Egypt the first Arab State to recognise Israel. Unwilling to shed blood to save his throne, the [Shah left his country](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/01/17/the-fall-of-the-shah-and-the-rise-of-islamism/)
 in January 1979 and in March 1980—after a grisly international journey—settled in Egypt; four months later he was dead. If the Six-Day War lit the touchpaper, the Shah’s fall kindled Islamism into a blaze: the seemingly most powerful ruler in the region—the one most unapologetically aligned to the West and Israel—had been brought down and replaced with an Islamist regime. The dream was possible.

The Islamists in Iran had been [assisted by Soviet-run Communists](https://www.meforum.org/62821/whither-iran-tehrans-russian-connection)
 during the Revolution and afterwards. For a time, [some even thought](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-shahs-view-of-the-revolution)
 the Red would triumph over the Black. By 1983, Ayatollah Khomeini ruled supreme, having destroyed his main Islamist rival, the [even-more radical](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/central-intelligence-agency-august-1981-iran-the-mujahedin-a.k.a.-mujahideen-e-khalq-or-mek.pdf)
 Mojahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), and the various organised Leftist factions. The Marxist inflection in Khomeini’s Revolution remained, however, visible in the way it cast itself as a movement on behalf of the _mostazafin_ (oppressed). The other key part of this was its non-sectarianism: Khomeini was Supreme Leader of the _Islamic_ Republic; in time, it was hoped, the Sunnis would see their error. Pending that, the Shi’a clergy would work with Sunni militants to export their Revolution.[4](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-4-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri became a “[poster boy](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-mullahs-manhattan-project/)
” for Iran’s revolutionary clergy. The relationship Al-Zawahiri forged with Tehran four decades ago lasted throughout his lifetime. Sometimes the mutual admiration [was even public](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/3506544/Iran-receives-al-Qaeda-praise-for-role-in-terrorist-attacks.html)
.

In October 1981, the Islamists that Al-Sadat had given space to struck him down. “I have killed Pharaoh”, [announced Al-Sadat’s murderer](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1984/05/31/the-egyptian-murder-case/)
, Khaled al-Islambuli. “I am not afraid to die.” And die he would, shot by a firing squad in April 1982. The Iranian regime named a street in its capital after Al-Islambuli, celebrating him as a “martyr”.[5](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-5-135614300)
 Al-Islambuli was a [member of EIJ](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ310/html/PLAW-115publ310.htm)
 and had been assisted in getting to Al-Sadat by a colonel in his retinue, Abud al-Zumar, the first leader of EIJ. Al-Zawahiri was arrested in the dragnet that followed Al-Sadat’s assassination, which rounded up hundreds of Islamists. Al-Zawahiri was not charged with conspiring in the murder itself; he was [convicted of weapons charges](https://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/zawahiri/profile.html)
. When Al-Zawahiri was [released in 1984](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-islamist-militancy/in-free-egypt-jihad-leader-says-time-for-gun-is-over-idUSTRE72H62820110318)
, in his early 30s, he left Egypt and would never return.

**JIHAD ON THE ROAD**


-----------------------

In December 1979, the Soviet Union conquered Afghanistan and installed a puppet Communist regime. **Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency** used the Mujahideen groups it had created from Afghan Islamists a half-decade earlier to run an insurgency against the Soviet occupation.[6](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-6-135614300)
 By 1982, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia began sponsoring the Afghan anti-Soviet resistance,[7](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-7-135614300)
 but this was channelled through Pakistan’s ISI, which empowered its own assets, above all Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most radical of the Islamists, whose ideology later fed into the global jihad movement.[8](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-8-135614300)

In 1984, a Palestinian shaykh, **Abdullah Azzam**, issued a _fatwa_ calling on all Muslims to fight the Soviets, and it provoked the first major foreign fighter flow, mostly of Arabs, to Afghanistan. Azzam created the Services Bureau (_al-Maktab al-Khidamat_), funded most significantly by Usama bin Laden, to facilitate this movement of foreigners. The “Arab-Afghans” did not receive direct State support for the simple reason that they were not an important military force in fighting the Soviet occupation: about 2,000 Arabs total (400 at any one time) were in Afghanistan amidst a Mujahideen force of perhaps a quarter-million.[9](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-9-135614300)
 Al-Zawahiri in his memoir is furious at the idea that the U.S. gave “one penny” to the Arab-Afghans.[10](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-10-135614300)
 The three battles in the late 1980s where the Arab-Afghans had a noteworthy contribution were military failures, but politically raised the profile of the Arab-Afghans,[11](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-11-135614300)
 and the politics among the Arab-Afghans was to have global significance.

In October 1986, Bin Laden created a military camp, the Lion’s Den of Supporters (_al-Masada al-Ansar_), which many simply called “the military base” (_al-Qaeda al-Askariyya_). It was out of the bureaucratic structures for the Masada camp that Al-Qaeda emerges around the spring of 1987: initially, “Al-Qaeda” referred to the camp and quickly evolved into a synonym for the _people_ associated with the camp, a group of Arab fighters operating as something like a special forces unit.[12](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-12-135614300)
 While Masada was to a degree established deliberately in isolation, physically and culturally, from the broader Mujahideen insurgency,[13](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-13-135614300)
 it had deep ties to some Mujahideen factions—[above all the Haqqanis](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
—that were very close to Pakistan’s ISI.[14](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-14-135614300)

In this period, the Arab-Afghans were diverging. Al-Zawahiri believed in the legitimacy of _takfir_ (excommunicating Muslims), especially against Arab rulers, in contrast to Azzam’s pan-Islamism that opposed _all_ Muslim-on-Muslim violence. The degree to which Al-Zawahiri was influencing Bin Laden in the late 1980s might be overstated,[15](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-15-135614300)
 but Azzam was certainly losing influence.[16](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-16-135614300)
 As the [Soviets wound down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/04/15/agreement-on-afghanistan-signed-in-geneva/c7288c64-6764-4e73-9bc5-7eeb48f7827d/)
 in Afghanistan in 1988, Azzam wanted to redirect the energy from the Afghan jihad to Palestine, for a war to eliminate Israel, an alien occupying power in his conception. Al-Zawahiri had a different script in mind: he wanted to separate the Arab-Afghans from even indirect allegiance with Muslim governments and have them war against the regime in Cairo, believing jihad should lead to the founding of a caliphate, starting in Egypt, “the heart of the Islamic world”.[17](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-17-135614300)
 The contest between Al-Zawahiri and Azzam ended as decisively as it dramatically in November 1989, when Azzam was killed in a highly public, highly mysterious bombing in Peshawar. The perpetrator remains unknown, but [Al-Zawahiri is on the suspects list](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/a-jihadi-murder-mystery-who-killed)
.

1991 was an important year in the development of Al-Qaeda. At the beginning of the year, the U.S.-led coalition—for once without Soviet opposition—reversed the annexation of Kuwait by Saddam Husayn’s Iraq. The Saudi government rejected Bin Laden’s call to “fight \[Saddam\] with faith” (his motley force of Arab-Afghans),[18](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-18-135614300)
 and in April 1991 Bin Laden left Saudi Arabia for the last time, moving to Pakistan.[19](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-19-135614300)
 The same year, Al-Zawahiri [took over EIJ](https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/mappingmilitants/profiles/egyptian-islamic-jihad)
, which was now less a group than a dispersed network of Egyptian militants abroad. And at the end of the year, the Soviet Union collapsed. For the jihadists, this was their victory, and the Soviet demise was the destruction of the more dangerous of the two infidel superpowers; dealing with America, made soft by self-indulgence and decadence of all kinds, would be comparatively easy. “Hit them and they will run”, [Bin Laden repeatedly said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/09/10/targeted-by-a-history-of-hatred/13108985-1814-4aee-b74c-6767f131f03e/)
, citing the U.S. abandoning South Vietnam and Beirut after the Iran/Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in October 1983. Somalia would be added to the list after the U.S. withdrew from there in 1993.

Bin Laden [arrived in Sudan in December 1991](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/al_qaeda_sahel.pdf)
,[20](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-20-135614300)
 travelling from Afghanistan. Bin Laden had first been invited to Sudan by Hassan al-Turabi, the Muslim Brotherhood cleric who was the power behind the throne, soon after the military coup by Islamist officers in June 1989.[21](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-21-135614300)
 Bin Laden had not immediately taken the offer but had cultivated relations with Al-Turabi and begun setting up Sudan as a node in Al-Qaeda’s network. In 1990, “agents of Bin Laden began to buy property in Sudan”.[22](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-22-135614300)
 When Al-Turabi [went to Jordan](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-mother-of-all-connections)
 in October 1990 to show support for Saddam, two months after Saddam had occupied and annexed Kuwait, Al-Turabi’s entourage included Bin Laden emissaries who [established contact](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 with Saddam’s regime. In 1991, [Saddam returned the favour](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, reaching out to Al-Qaeda through Sudan. Once Bin Laden was in Sudan, Al-Qaeda became fully intertwined with the Islamist regime, providing resources for its civil war against the Christians in the south, in exchange for Al-Qaeda receiving safe haven and the amenities of a State, like passports.

Al-Zawahiri was not “formally” a member of Al-Qaeda at this time, and was still, as emir of EIJ, a leading proponent of the “near enemy” school of jihad: direct war with the Muslim regimes to establish Islamist emirates that could link up into a caliphate. Bin Laden was moving towards the “far enemy” strategy, the idea that a global war against the American-led West was needed first, to push it out of the Middle East, because only then could Islamic revolutions locally succeed. The distinction between the “near enemy” and “far enemy” camps was never as sharp as all that, though, demonstrated by Al-Zawahiri acting as Bin Laden’s roving ambassador in the first half of the 1990s and the training Al-Qaeda gave to “near enemy”-focused jihadists in the Afghan camps later in the decade.[23](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-23-135614300)

Al-Zawahiri, had made a [trip to Tehran in April 1991](https://ctc.usma.edu/marriage-of-convenience-the-evolution-of-iran-and-al-qaidas-tactical-cooperation)
 to gain financial support and training for an Islamic revolution in Egypt. Probably in early 1992, via Al-Zawahiri, Bin Laden [met with](https://kyleorton.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/united-states-v-ali-mohamed-plea-hearing-20-october-2000.pdf)
 Imad Mughniya, the officer of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in military control of Hizballah in Lebanon, to arrange for Al-Qaeda jihadists to receiving training. **This Al-Zawahiri-facilitated meeting was the start of an ever-deepening [relationship between Al-Qaeda and Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
** that lasts to this day. Also in 1992, [Al-Zawahiri met with Saddam’s foreign intelligence chief](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
, Faruq Hijazi, in Khartoum, beginning a “highly secretive relationship with Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and later with Al-Qaeda”. Contact was [maintained](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 between EIJ/Al-Qaeda and Saddam’s Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) through Hijazi in Sudan up to 1995, with additional meetings in Pakistan, and occasional visits by Al-Qaeda and affiliated jihadists to Baghdad, including Al-Zawahiri, who [went to the Iraqi capital](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/03/25/the-great-terror)
 in 1992 to meet Saddam himself.

The fact that Sudan in the 1990s acted as a nexus for Al-Qaeda and its jihadist allies with two notorious State-sponsors of anti-American terrorism, Saddam’s Iraq and Clerical Iran, was [well-known even in public discourse](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
, though it would later be “forgotten” that everyone knew this when political imperatives shifted.

**Al-Zawahiri arrived in Bosnia as early as September 1992**,[24](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-24-135614300)
 and would cycle in and out of the country over the next three-and-a-half years as part of the foreign jihadist contingent that was heavily inflected with Al-Qaeda operatives. In Bosnia, Al-Zawahiri [worked closely with Iran](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/01/23/from-bosnia-to-guantanamo/)

, Al-Qaeda would fail to incite an Islamic revolution, but laid down infrastructure that served it as a logistics hub. This, too, was assisted by Iran, which had created its own Islamic revolutionary clone in Yemen on the Hizballah model, Ansarallah (a.k.a. the Huthis).[25](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-25-135614300)

 in 1994 to check on Al-Banna’s progress. Al-Banna set about forging relationships with local jihadist leaders and tribes, and [worked closely](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/twenty-years-after-9-11-the-jihadi-threat-in-the-arabian-peninsula/)
 with the IRGC’s Ansarallah, acquiring weapons and other forms of support to smuggle operatives into Saudi Arabia, seeding the networks that Al-Qaeda used to launch a jihadist revolt in the Kingdom from 2003 to 2005.[28](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-28-135614300)
 The beaten Saudi Al-Qaeda operatives would retreat to Yemen and merge with their Yemeni network to form Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the third of Al-Qaeda’s “affiliates”, Al-Banna having helped set up the first in Iraq that we now know as the Islamic State.[29](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-29-135614300)

In May 1996, Bin Laden had been expelled from Sudan, under American pressure, and moved to Afghanistan, where [the ISI had switched to the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/08/17/pakistan-and-the-taliban/)
, after tiring of the Mujahideen, as its favoured instrument for colonising the country. Bin Laden came to a similar arrangement with the Taliban regime as he had in Sudan, only with deeper foundations, practically and [ideologically](https://www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda%E2%80%99s-quasi-caliph-the-recasting-of-mullah-%E2%80%98umar/)
: Bin Laden pledged allegiance (_bay’a_) to Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Umar as Commander of the Faithful (_Emir al-Mumineen_). The U.S. had miscalculated in having Bin Laden forced out of Sudan. It transpired to be more advantageous for Al-Qaeda to be in Afghanistan.

There were two other major jihadi hotspots in the mid-1990s into which Al-Qaeda inserted itself, in [Algeria](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/03/21/algerias-years-of-blood-not-quite-what-they-seem/)
 and Chechnya. **Al-Zawahiri’s trip to Chechnya, in southern Russia, in December 1996, is [one of the strangest episodes](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/08/how-russia-manipulates-islamic-terrorism/)
 in the history of the jihadi-Salafist movement**. Al-Zawahiri was arrested soon after his arrival, alongside [Ahmad Salama Mabruk](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/10/04/al-qaeda-in-syria-and-american-policy/)
 (Abu Faraj al-Masri) and Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi, and imprisoned until May 1997. Al-Zawahiri was then let go and allowed to continue his work among the jihadists in the Caucasus, before rendezvousing with Bin Laden in Afghanistan. The Russian claim that it only later learned Al-Zawahiri’s identity is not credible. Moscow had surely come across Al-Zawahiri in the 1970s, when it was [covertly supporting EIJ](https://jamestown.org/program/a-russian-agent-at-the-right-hand-of-bin-laden-2/#.VEWC9vnF_jU)

**MOVING TO GLOBAL JIHAD**


----------------------------

Al-Qaeda had been [linked to terrorist attacks](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4677978)
 against the West earlier in the 1990s—the hotel bombings in Yemen in December 1992, the first World Trade Centre attack in New York in February 1993, in Somalia during the “Black Hawk down” incident in October 1993, the foiled 9/11 precursor “Bojinka plot” in January 1995, and the bombing against U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia in November 1995—but it was only after Al-Zawahiri’s Russian sojourn that he got on board with the “far enemy” strategy. Bin Laden had issued his [first fatwa](https://ctc.usma.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Declaration-of-Jihad-against-the-Americans-Occupying-the-Land-of-the-Two-Holiest-Sites-Translation.pdf)
 declaring jihad against American in August 1996 and in February 1998 issued a second fatwa—by some accounts “encouraged” by Al-Zawahiri[30](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-30-135614300)
—that [declared all-out war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/saudi-arabia/1998-11-01/license-kill-usama-bin-ladins-declaration-jihad)
 against Americans and Jews globally. The 1998 statement was inter alia [signed by Al-Zawahiri](https://irp.fas.org/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm)
 and [Rifai Taha](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2017/01/20/the-coalition-strikes-down-al-qaedas-leaders-in-syria/)
 (Abu Yasser al-Masri), then-operational head of the Jamaat since “the Blind Shaykh” was in prison.

The bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998, which killed two-hundred people, made Al-Qaeda a household name, at least in Western security circles. Al-Zawahiri was [personally implicated](http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/18/alzawahiri.charges/)
 in the atrocities. The support of the Iranian regime [had been important](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/10/26/examining-irans-long-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 in making the East Africa Embassy bombings possible and now Tehran was sure that Al-Qaeda meant business in its war with America, the relationship only deepened.

By 1998, Iran was not the only actor intensifying its interest in the increasingly lethal Al-Qaeda: Saddam was, too. Whether or not [Bin Laden himself had gone to Iraq](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 in January 1998, in February 1998—three weeks before the fatwa declaring war on America and Jews—Al-Zawahiri had gone to Baghdad again, meeting Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan “to arrange for coordination between Iraq and bin Laden”: there was talk of establishing training camps for Al-Qaeda on Iraqi territory and Al-Zawahiri was given $300,000.[31](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-31-135614300)
 By February 1998, the U.S. and Saddam were several months into a showdown that [seemed likely to end](https://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/17/transcripts/clinton.iraq/)
 with a U.S. invasion to depose Saddam. Saddam was ultimately [rescued by Kofi Annan](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/08/19/the-legacy-of-kofi-annan/)
 of the United Nations, but the danger never completely passed—the [Senate voted unanimously](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4655)
 to make it official U.S. policy to remove Saddam from power in October 1998—and Al-Qaeda was clearly viewed as a handy potential instrument for retaliation. In March 1998, two separate Al-Qaeda envoys went to Saddam’s Iraq,[32](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-32-135614300)
 one of them [spending more than two weeks in Baghdad](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
. At least one of the March 1998 meetings was “apparently arranged through … Zawahiri, who had _ties of his own_ to the Iraqis” \[italics added\], and it seems to have been Al-Zawahiri who arranged for a Saddamist “delegation” to visit Afghanistan in July 1998 to meet, “first with the Taliban and then with Bin Laden”.[33](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-33-135614300)
 ([Saddam and the Taliban](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/29/saddam-and-the-taliban/)
 also had independent relations.) The Saddam-Al-Qaeda relationship became important in late 1998 as Al-Qaeda’s relations with the Taliban faltered.

After the August 1996 fatwa, Taliban emir Mullah Umar, partly under pressure from Saudi Arabia, one of only three States to recognise the Taliban government, had asked Bin Laden to cease public incitement against America and generally keep a low profile.[34](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-34-135614300)
 Bin Laden clearly ignored this, for example giving [an interview to Peter Arnett](https://edition.cnn.com/2001/COMMUNITY/12/05/gen.arnett.cnna/index.html)
 of _CNN_ in March 1997, where Bin Laden infamously threatened America live on television, and after the Embassy bombings in August 1998 Bin Laden did another media blitz claiming responsibility, ensuring that retaliatory strikes fell on Taliban Afghanistan. The IIS station in Iraq’s Pakistan Embassy [became](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 Saddam’s “point of contact with Al-Qaeda” by late 1998. Two IIS officers [went into Afghanistan](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 in December 1998 to meet Bin Laden, Al-Zawahiri, and Mullah Umar. Later in the month, shortly after President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing campaign (Operation DESERT FOX) against [Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) infrastructure](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/22/why-was-there-ever-an-american-occupation-of-iraq/)
, Hijazi, by this point Iraq’s ambassador in Turkey, also journeyed to Afghanistan to meet Bin Laden. Hijazi [returned](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/case-closed-4618)
 for another visit in January 1999. What is most interesting, especially in retrospect, is that these 1998-99 moves in the Saddam-Qaeda relationship were [all reported in real time](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/06/21/saddam-al-qaeda-stephen-hayes-the-connection/)
 in Western newspapers that denied any such relationship existed three years later.

The culmination of Saddam’s interplay with Al-Qaeda was a proposal in early 1999 for Bin Laden and his organisation, including Al-Zawahiri, to move to Iraq. The U.S. was especially trepidatious about Bin Laden taking shelter under Saddam’s roof because it would have made U.S. plans to kill the Al-Qaeda leader—then at their height—impossible. The U.S. was in a catch-22, however, because if it operationalised an assassination mission against Bin Laden, this would be discovered by Pakistan, which would detect the U-2 flights needed to locate Bin Laden before airstrikes were launched, and the ISI would then tip-off Bin Laden, triggering his move to Iraq before any bombing run could take place—putting him out of the U.S.’s reach.[35](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-35-135614300)
 This limbo created by the Pakistanis persisted essentially up to 9/11.

Bin Laden ultimately decided not to take the Iraqi offer and patched things up with the Taliban, agreeing to cease his media appearances: this was partly [under criticism](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/14/al-qaeda-central-in-syria/)
 from senior Arab jihadist figures like **Muhammad al-Bahaya (Abu Khalid al-Suri)** and **Mustafa Setmariam Nasar (Abu Musab al-Suri)**, partly because 9/11 was in the works and he needed less American attention, and partly because the U.S. strikes on Afghanistan after the Embassy bombings had, [unbeknownst to everyone at the time](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1028236160532452080)
, reconciled the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, becoming “a rallying point for defiance of America and shut off Taliban discussion of expelling the militants”. The Taliban had never been opposed to anti-American terrorism; they had told Bin Laden he was quite at liberty to “fight America”, but they had insisted he should “do so without much talk and shouting from our lands”.[36](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-36-135614300)
 Bin Laden finally did as he was told. In October 2000, Al-Qaeda carried out its last major pre-9/11 attack, blowing up an American warship, the U.S.S. _Cole_, in the Aden harbour, killing seventeen servicemen: Bin Laden was nowhere to be seen—and nor was any American response.

Al-Zawahiri was involved in the efforts Al-Qaeda made to construct WMD in Afghanistan in 2000-01, including acting as a link for the recruitment of experts from Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Indonesia, led by Al-Qaeda operative Riduan Isamuddin, born [Encep Nurjaman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/us/politics/guantanamo-bali-bombing.html)
, and universally known as “Hambali”.[37](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-37-135614300)
 (There was an Iraq dimension to this story, too, around Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, which later became [the subject of much controversy](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2019/12/28/the-cia-and-iraq-intelligence-failures-media-successes/)
.)

**AL-ZAWAHIRI AND 9/11**


--------------------------

The architect of the 9/11 plot was Khaled Shaykh Muhammad (KSM), a Pakistani citizen, who had been involved in the Mujahideen war against the Soviets and the Bosnian jihad. KSM had then been involved in various Islamist terrorist plots across the world. KSM was the uncle of the lead conspirator in the World Trade Centre attack in 1993, Ramzi Yusef, with whom he had planned the Bojinka operation,[38](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-38-135614300)
 which also [involved Hambali](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/individual/nurjaman-riduan-isamuddin)
. In January 1996, KSM moved to Afghanistan, establishing contact with Al-Qaeda’s military chief, [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and through Atef attained a meeting with Bin Laden soon after he arrived in Afghanistan months later, where “KSM presented the Al-Qaeda leader with a menu of ideas for terrorist operations”.[39](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-39-135614300)
 At this first meeting, KSM proposed the “Planes Operation” that would become 9/11. Bin Laden listened “without much comment” and asked KSM to join Al-Qaeda and move his family to Afghanistan.[40](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-40-135614300)
 KSM refused to give _bay’a_ to Bin Laden and left his family in Iran, moving them to Pakistan in January 1997.[41](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-41-135614300)
 Contact waned between KSM and Bin Laden through 1997, but, after the East African Embassy bombings, KSM got back in touch with Bin Laden and “sometime in late 1998 or early 1999”, Bin Laden gave the “green light” for the 9/11 operation.[42](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-42-135614300)

The 9/11 plot was an “off-the-books operation” within Al-Qaeda: the executive body, the Consultation Council (_Majlis al-Shura_), was kept in the dark.[43](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-43-135614300)
 **Only three people—Bin Laden, KSM, and Atef—“developed \[the\] initial list of targets”**.[44](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-44-135614300)
 **Al-Zawahiri was the next to be brought into the plot**,[45](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-45-135614300)
 tasked with trying to find “potential sponsors in the Gulf”.[46](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-46-135614300)
 (It had been inter alia a lack of money that had made Bin Laden hesitant about the “Planes Operation” when KSM first proposed it in 1996.)

While KSM never would formally join Al-Qaeda, Al-Zawahiri did, **[merging EIJ](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/16/the-man-behind-bin-laden)
 with Bin Laden’s outfit in June 2001**. There are two notable things about this. First, EIJ’s sense of itself as a “[national-revolutionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413161153/http:/www.jihadica.com/al-qaeda-revives-its-beef-with-the-islamic-state/)
” group remained strong enough that a large section refused to follow Al-Zawahiri and split away. Second, the merger primarily served as an attempt to stack the _Shura_ so Bin Laden could gain its retrospective approval for 9/11. Six of the nine _Shura_ seats were held by EIJ members loyal to Al-Zawahiri when Bin Laden revealed his plan to attack America to it on 27 June 2001, though it never actually came to a vote: the discussion exposed so much dissent, even among the Egyptians, that Bin Laden declared “the matter had already been decided” and ended the meeting.[47](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-47-135614300)

At [8:46](https://timeline.911memorial.org/#Timeline/2)
 on the morning of 11 September 2001, Al-Qaeda smashed a plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre. By just after 10:00, planes had struck the South Tower and the Pentagon, and Flight 93 was brought down by a passenger revolt near Shanksville in Pennsylvania. Half-an-hour later, the Twin Towers were a heap of rubble. 3,000 people were dead and 25,000 had been wounded.

The U.S. demanded the perpetrators, specifically Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri,[48](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-48-135614300)
 be handed over, and the Taliban, [encouraged by Pakistan](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
, decided it would rather give up its regime than surrender Bin Laden to the Americans. On 7 October 2001, the U.S. began the invasion of Afghanistan. Atef was killed in mid-November 2001, the first major scalp of the War on Terror. Shortly afterwards, Al-Zawahiri [“favourite” wife](https://ctc.usma.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
, Azza Ahmed Nuwair, was killed in an airstrike, along with two of his children, a source of personal bitterness against the Americans that Al-Zawahiri has repeatedly made reference to.

Cornered at Tora Bora, Al-Qaeda was [rescued by Pakistan and Iran](https://aljumhuriya.net/en/2018/01/24/states-saved-al-qaeda/)
: the Pakistanis drew away their troops, intended to prevent escape as the Americans closed in, for a confrontation with India, and the Iranians deputised Hekmatyar—who had put himself in the service of the IRGC after the ISI discarded him for the Taliban—to bring Al-Qaeda’s military and religious leadership, and Bin Laden’s family, to safety within Iran.

Bin Laden kept on the move over the next four years, reportedly first basing himself in Kunar province in eastern Afghanistan, where he met Iranian agents in Shegal to enquire about recovering his family from Iran and sometimes slipping over the border to Karachi,[49](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-49-135614300)
 before moving into the north-western tribal areas of Pakistan, cycling through towns like Shangla,[50](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-50-135614300)
 Haripur, and ultimately settling in the compound where he was found in Abbottabad in August 2005.[51](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-51-135614300)
 Pakistan would play dumb about the Qaeda presence in Abbottabad in 2011, but, in 2004, no less a person than then-Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, [wrote in his memoir](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 that he knew of a network of Al-Qaeda safehouses in the town, one of which contained “someone important in Al-Qaeda”. After KSM was [arrested](https://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/)
 in a CIA-led operation in March 2003 in Rawalpindi, near the Pakistani capital, in the home of a senior official of one the ISI-supported political parties, Jamaat-e-Islami, he was replaced as head of external operations by Mustafa al-Uzaybi (Abu Faraj al-Libi). The ISI has [publicly acknowledged](https://www.rferl.org/a/abbottabad_not_a_new_home_for_terror/24093251.html)
 searching a house in Abbottabad looking for Al-Uzaybi as early as 2003 and Al-Uzaybi was eventually captured in Mardan, a town two hours west of Abbottabad, not far from the old Arab-Afghan “capital” of Peshawar.

For much of the last twenty years, Al-Zawahiri’s “[whereabouts \[have\] … been a mystery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/08/01/zawahiri-al-qaeda-killed/)
”. The one reasonably solid lead on Al-Zawahiri’s hideout came after Al-Uzaybi [disclosed in custody](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pakistan-demands-no-airstrike-repeat/)
 that shortly beforehand he had met with Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in the Bajaur area of what was then the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in north-west Pakistan. **One of the first U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan targeted Al-Zawahiri in Damadola in January 2006** during what was believed to be [a meeting with Faqir Muhammad](https://ctc.usma.edu/a-profile-of-tehrik-i-taliban-pakistan/)
, the deputy leader of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or “Pakistani” Taliban after its official announcement in 2007. How close the U.S. got to Al-Zawahiri that day is contested. The main takeaway from the incident was how intimately tied TTP is to Al-Qaeda and by extension the rest of the ISI network that includes the “Afghan” Taliban and the so-called [Haqqani Network](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
.[52](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-52-135614300)
 Making the point in a different way, a lot of [circumstantial evidence over the years](https://medium.com/@asfandyarmir/where-is-ayman-al-zawahiri-fb37e459c6a9)
 points to Al-Zawahiri having been under TTP protection in eastern Afghanistan. There was a claim around 2016 that Al-Zawahiri had “shifted his permanent base to Iran”.[53](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-53-135614300)
 This was evidently untrue: a visit, perhaps even an extended one, is certainly possible—a Taliban leader was [killed in the same period](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/23/death-of-mullah-mansoor-highlights-talibans-links-with-iran)
 returning to Pakistan from Iran—but he clearly did not stay there.

**LEADING AL-QAEDA: REBELLION FROM WITHOUT AND FROM WITHIN**


--------------------------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri was [named](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-11489337)
 as Al-Qaeda’s new emir on 16 June 2011, six weeks after the U.S. Navy SEALs caught up with Bin Laden. The organization Al-Zawahiri took over was an international network very different to the special forces-type outfit Bin Laden founded in 1987. In the first decade of the twentieth century, Al-Qaeda had expanded beyond its military assistance mission for the Arab-Afghans in Afghanistan to provide such services to local insurgencies abroad, recognising some of these as branches or “affiliates” under a [system it called “Al-Qalim”](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/14/the-structure-of-al-qaeda/)

 was **Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia (AQM)**, which had a [complicated relationship](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)

Al-Zawahiri took over amid the “Arab Spring”. Tunisia’s autocrat had been put to flight and in Egypt the crowds had done what Al-Zawahiri had been trying to do for thirty years, bringing down Al-Sadat’s dutiful successor, Hosni Mubarak, who was [once described](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/egypt/1995-09-01/sorrows-egypt)
 as “a civil servant with the rank of president”. Yemen’s long-time ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh had [nearly](https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-57481820110603)
 been shelled out of office and Libya was in full-scale rebellion against Colonel Muamar al-Qaddafi, which NATO had [stepped in to assist](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/10/21/why-nato-was-right-to-intervene-in-libya/)
. Al-Zawahiri’s [first released speech](http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/07/28/al.qaeda.leader.message/index.html)
 as leader, however, in late July 2011, focused Syria, at that time four months into a generally peaceful uprising that had been met with pitiless brutality by Bashar al-Asad’s regime, assisted by Iran. Al-Zawahiri encouraged Syrians to adopt the way of jihad and not to look to the U.S. for support. It was to be events in Syria that more than any other shaped Al-Zawahiri’s tenure as Al-Qaeda’s emir.

Some [took the view](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704436004576299110143040714)
 that “the Arab Spring has simply overwhelmed the world of the jihadists.” Unfortunately, this was not so. The breakdown of States and the outbreak of civil wars allowed Al-Qaeda space and opportunities to expand. Bin Laden had been [musing on renaming](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/24/bin-laden-documents-alqaida-struggle)
 Al-Qaeda before his death, and in the post-Arab Spring phase the group half-heartedly did this, using the name “Ansar al-Shari’a” in many places. In Yemen, AQAP [made three attempts](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/05/10/yemen-and-al-qaedas-long-term-strategy/)
 to create local emirates: shorter-lived efforts in 2011 and 2013, and—after the [coup by the IRGC’s Huthis and their rapid jihad](https://eeradicalization.com/becoming-ansar-allah-islamic-revolution-yemen-oved-lobel/)
 conquered vast swathes of the country—a more successful effort for a year in 2015-16 in Mukalla that ended effectively in withdrawal, rather than defeat. Al-Qaeda embedded in Libya after Qaddafi, notoriously murdering the U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens in Benghazi in September 2012, and was concurrently occupying northern Mali, from which it was removed by French intervention in early 2013. In Somalia, Al-Shabab’s fortunes have waxed and waned, but the group remains powerful in the southern and rural zones, while intermittently challenging the nominal State in its one area of serious control, the capital Mogadishu. These statelet projects in the first half of 2010s built to some extent on what had happened in Iraq a decade earlier, and in some places, notably Mali, repeated some of the same mistakes—failing, as AQIM’s then-emir [Abd al-Malek Drukdel](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2020/06/11/france-kill-drukdel-aqim/)
 (Abu Musab Abd al-Wadud) put it in [a letter to his theatre commander](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/en-jihadi-rivalry-2.pdf)
, to realise that the population was like a “baby … in its first days” that needed “support … until it stands”, not the application of shari’a with “extreme speed”, which will “engender hatred towards the mujahideen”.

Zarqawi’s Islamic State movement had been sponsored by Al-Qaeda since its creation in 1999, significantly driven by **Muhammad Saladin Zaydan (Sayf al-Adel)**, a then-senior Bin Laden deputy and Al-Qaeda’s military chief after Atef’s demise. Sayf’s thinking was conditioned in 1999 by intra-jihadist rivalries in Afghanistan. After 9/11, it was Sayf—by then based in Iran, where he still is—who led the effort to merge Al-Qaeda’s and Zarqawi’s strategic visions. Zarqawi, who received his own [direct assistance from the Iranians](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 ahead of his arrival in Saddam’s Baghdad in May 2002, never overtly broke his arrangement with Al-Qaeda before his death in June 2006. Indeed, Zarqawi finally gave _bay’a_ to Bin Laden in October 2004 and formally took on the Al-Qaeda name.

That said, even Zarqawi had cross-words with Al-Qaeda’s leadership—Al-Zawahiri wrote him a [famously reproving letter](https://ctc.westpoint.edu/harmony-program/zawahiris-letter-to-zarqawi-original-language-2/)
 that was intercepted in 2005—and Zarqawi’s successors almost immediately moved relations into [a state of willed ambiguity](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
, where they remained for eight years, before the contest over jihadist visions for Syria led to a catastrophic rupture in 2014. The [crucial point is](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/zarqawi-profile-to-2004-al-qaeda-jihadism-iraq)
 that analysis goes wrong if it sees the Islamic State as an Al-Qaeda “offshoot”: what happened in 2014 was “not a schism in the sense of two entities emerging from common foundations; it was the inevitable unravelling of an attempt, made in contingent circumstances, to merge two distinct and incompatible strategic visions.”

I wrote [a lengthy report recently on Al-Qaeda’s strategic evolution](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
, which is heavily impacted by its interaction with the Islamic State, so I won’t reiterate all of that here. The only additional point to highlight is that if one has to pin down a fork in the road where the IS-Qaeda collaboration became untenable, it was not 2013-14 in Syria, but 2007-08 in Iraq: “Where Bin Laden had seen IS’s setback \[in the Surge and Awakening\] as evidence their strategy was defective, IS had [come to the reverse conclusion](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/the-islamic-states-strategic-plan)
: there had been tactical errors, especially with the tribes, but the essentials of their theological-strategic vision were correct, and with adjustments they could recover and prevail; \[with the declaration of the ‘caliphate’\] they had their proof. As IS saw it, having been left for dead in 2007-08, they were able to revive by keeping their ideology pure and then do what all other Islamists claim to want to do.” A similar ideological divergence has taken hold in assessing the destruction of the “caliphate” in 2019: Al-Qaeda believes to have tried and failed makes it more difficult to convince people to try again; IS says it shows it is possible.

Under Al-Zawahiri, Al-Qaeda’s separation from the Islamic State movement was made absolute, and there is now no way back. Al-Zawahiri, building off some of the last things Bin Laden was writing, even [leaned-in to some of the accusations](https://eeradicalization.com/al-qaeda-global-terrorism-report-kyle-orton/)
 the Zarqawists levelled at him, particularly about Al-Qaeda’s “populist” turn, its view that jihad cannot succeed without a mass audience. IS, of course, will have no part of holding the implementation of the Holy Law hostage to a plebiscite. The competition between Al-Qaeda and the Zarqawists has shaped the jihadist movement over the last decade, and will surely be important for some time to come, though the question remains of how long Al-Qaeda can remain in the competition.

**AL-ZAWAHIRI’S DOWNFALL AND AL-QAEDA NOW**


---------------------------------------------

Al-Zawahiri’s demise, six decades after he joined the jihad and a quarter-century after he became one of America’s most wanted men, was suitably dramatic—in itself and in its implications.

Just [after 6 AM](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62400923)
 that Sunday morning a year ago, having done his morning prayers, Al-Zawahiri stepped out onto the balcony of a villa in the Sherpur area of Kabul that had been [appropriated from](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/hey-thats-my-house-us-aid-worker-realises-zawahiri-villa-is-his-old-home)
 one of the American aid workers forced to flee Afghanistan when President Biden [gave the country back](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/courage-strength-optimism/bidens-enduring-afghanistan-debacle)
 to Pakistan’s jihadists in August 2021. Al-Zawahiri was being watched by an American drone and moments later the Al-Qaeda leader was shredded by two Hellfire R9Xs, missiles that use rapidly rotating blades instead of explosives to minimise unintentional casualties.[54](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-54-135614300)
 Biden, in his [statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/08/01/remarks-by-president-biden-on-a-successful-counterterrorism-operation-in-afghanistan/)
 announcing Al-Zawahiri’s killing, drew attention to the blood on Al-Zawahiri’s hands and quite rightly added: “justice has been delivered”.

The most immediate question was who would replace Al-Zawahiri and one year later we are still waiting for an answer to _that_ question. **Al-Qaeda has not formally announced Al-Zawahiri’s replacement**, and there are [several possibilities](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)
, though it is widely believed **Sayf al-Adel** has the role.[55](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-55-135614300)
 Sayf would continue the localisation of Al-Qaeda and its aversion to direct terrorism in the West, having never wanted to go down that path in the first place (Sayf was [among the internal opponents](https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/86743/1/Gohel_Deciphering%20Al-Qaeda_2018.pdf)
 of the 9/11 attacks). But Sayf might well try to step up regional terrorism, or at least might well find himself being directed to escalate on that front. When Sayf began his present stay in Iran in 2002, as a guest of the thankfully-late [Qassem Sulaymani](https://eeradicalization.com/the-middle-east-after-qassem-sulaymani/)
, his relationship with the clerical regime and its spy-terrorist commander was already old.[56](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-56-135614300)
 Sayf had, for example, been one the Al-Qaeda jihadists [on the Iranian training program](https://kyleorton1991.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/u-s-district-court-ruling-2011-11-28-iran-hizballah-involvement-in-1998-embassy-attacks.pdf)
 that enabled the East Africa Embassy bombings in 1998, and it was Sayf, while in Iran, who [relayed the orders](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10576100802291568)
—from Al-Zawahiri, notably—to begin the terrorist campaign in Saudi Arabia in the early 2000s. At this stage there is no doubt that Sayf is a creature of the IRGC; there have been chances to leave, [taken by some of Sayf’s comrades](https://twitter.com/KyleWOrton/status/1566036131275227137)
, but he never has. Iran has exerted [considerable influence](https://eeradicalization.com/death-and-consequences-for-al-qaedas-leadership/)
 over Al-Qaeda for decades and Sayf’s ascension would be the culmination of that. Which would be Sayf’s primary problem: Al-Qaeda’s operatives and sympathisers have gotten used to rationalising the relationship with Iran;[57](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-57-135614300)
 having the Iranians so overtly running the show is a different matter.[58](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-58-135614300)
 The operational benefits of having a terrorist regime behind Sayf are obvious, but the political consequences [within the jihadist world](https://anbajassim.com/2022/08/30/%d8%aa%d8%b2%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d8%b5%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%aa-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6%d8%a9-%d9%84%d8%aa%d9%88%d9%84%d9%8a-%d8%b3%d9%8a%d9%81-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%af/)
 are negative, whether it is morale within Al-Qaeda or the group’s ability to compete with the Islamic State for the “undecideds”.

It is an open question how much impact Sayf or anyone else as emir _can_ have on Al-Qaeda’s fortunes, even if he brings further Iranian support to the role. Al-Zawahiri was a notoriously awful, charisma-less speaker, which certainly matters when Al-Qaeda’s leader is significantly involved in setting strategic direction and tone.[59](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-59-135614300)
 Some argue this visible failure has obscured [Al-Zawahiri’s quieter successes](https://www.jihadica.com/zawahiri-is-not-the-loser-people-think-he-is/)
, notably keeping the organisation cohesive after the Islamic State challenge. There is likely something to this,[60](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-60-135614300)
 even if Al-Zawahiri was not the [effective micromanager Bin Laden was](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/books/review/the-rise-and-fall-of-osama-bin-laden-peter-bergen.html)
 right down to the end. While it is not clear whether Sayf would be better at the propaganda side of the work, he does seem to be skilled in bureaucracy and strategy. The problem is, Sayf is inheriting an organisation that is struggling on most metrics and in ways that will not easily be patched up. The decentralisation, for example, has weakened the Centre’s influence, but has not compartmentalised the theatres very well from the contagion of failure: [whatever is going on in Syria](https://eeradicalization.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/EER-Report-Al-Qaeda-and-Global-Terrorism-Kyle-Orton.pdf#page=21)
, the jihadists are restricted to a besieged corner of the country; things are not good in Yemen; the competition with the Islamic State in Africa grinds on. Still, Afghanistan could yet revive the group’s fortunes; paradoxically, Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul is a serious sign of life for Al-Qaeda.

Probably the most important implication of Al-Zawahiri being killed in the Taliban’s capital is that it [eliminates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taliban-ties-with-al-qaeda-endure-as-terrorist-leader-killed-by-u-s-in-afghan-capital-11659482149)
 all the silly arguments about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda being separable. Where one goes, the other follows, because they are not, in fact, meaningfully distinct organisations but a part of a single jihadist network, sharing an ideology, resources, and ultimately a command structure that runs through Aabpara.[61](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-61-135614300)
 To crystalise this point, Al-Zawahiri was in a house [owned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-62393618)
 and [protected](https://twitter.com/FrudBezhan/status/1554432905899909121)
 by Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is the “interior minister” of the Taliban’s emirate and the declared overall deputy of the Taliban. Sirajuddin is also a [senior Al-Qaeda member](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2021/09/07/pakistan-isi-jihad-afghanistan-haqqani-network-taliban-al-qaeda/)
,[62](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-62-135614300)
 and the well-trained unit within the Taliban that Siraj directly oversees, the “Haqqani Network”, is [particularly](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-15026909)
 [close](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/world/asia/mullen-asserts-pakistani-role-in-attack-on-us-embassy.html)
 to [the ISI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pakistan-cia-attack-idUSKCN0XB2VM)
, which means Pakistan’s military-intelligence establishment knew where Al-Qaeda’s leader was and tried to shield him from America—_again_.[63](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-63-135614300)

It is in part to avoid these implications for the Taliban/Pakistan that no admission has been put out under Al-Qaeda’s name that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. Hours after the strike, the [Taliban condemned it](https://jihadology.net/2022/08/01/new-statement-from-the-islamic-emirate-of-afghanistans-dhabi%e1%b8%a5-allah-mujahid-regarding-the-drone-attack-in-kabul-city/)
, hilariously as a violation of the “Doha Agreement”. The Doha “deal” did not have many concrete terms—its main purpose was to cover the U.S. withdrawal—but in so many words it frowned on harbouring Al-Qaeda’s emir. Anyway, [reporting from earlier this year](https://www.thedailybeast.com/al-qaeda-is-planning-to-fake-the-death-of-ayman-al-zawahiri-its-dead-leader)
 indicated that the Taliban wanted to get out of this awkward situation by muzzling Al-Qaeda—the attempt to hold a public funeral was apparently shut down—and then announcing at some point that Al-Zawahiri has died of natural causes, definitely not in Afghanistan. To this hour, the Taliban are [issuing direct denials](https://www.voanews.com/a/7193513.html)
 that Al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul. It is difficult to believe anybody is actually fooled by this, but it is possible the U.S. and others in Europe will go along with this for political reasons, both to save their own face about what they have already done and to pave the way for the “engagement” with the Taliban that some of them think is necessary.

Biden’s supporters and the [usual suspects](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/08/01/al-zawahiri-killing-shows-over-the-horizon-counterterrorism-can-work/)
 tried to make political hay out of Al-Zawahiri’s killing, claiming it as a victory for the “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism “strategy”. Doubtless this narrative had some traction. Cynics might wonder if the timing of this strike—given that Al-Zawahiri was [tracked down](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-02/joe-biden-to-speak-al-qaeda-leader-ayman-al-zawahiri/101290492)
 six [months earlier](https://twitter.com/abdsayedd/status/1554386396516732930)
—was not meant to dampen the criticism on the first anniversary of Biden abandoning Afghanistan. If so, it pretty much worked. The success on the political front, however, does not erase the analytical questions from those of us who regard this [“over-the-rainbow” concept](https://www.axios.com/2021/09/12/afghanistan-counterterrorism-over-horizon-biden)
 askance. The full weight of the American Imperium being able to find and neutralise one long-time nemesis [does not even begin to suggest](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/can-the-west-keep-track-of-the-threat)
 that the U.S. has good visibility into the dynamics within Afghanistan that are fostering emerging threats. All we know for now is that the jihadist movement and Islamists more broadly have been buoyed by the fall of Afghanistan, and that Al-Qaeda is in places Biden said it would not be.[64](https://www.kyleorton.com/p/ayman-al-zawahiri-life-in-jihad#footnote-64-135614300)

Bin Laden had been moved to create the Masada camp after the humiliating fiasco at Zhawar in April 1986, which disclosed how badly organised and incapable the Arab-Afghan fighters were. In April 1987, the Arab-Afghans endured what might most accurately be described as a less-bad defeat at the battle at Jaji: the Mujahideen (just about) held off one of the Soviet “retreating offensive” incursions, but the Arabs got mauled and forced to retreat. Still, it wasn’t quite the decimation of a year earlier, and Bin Laden—who personally fought at Jaji—ascribed the improvement, naturally, to the training at Masada. In casting the Arabs at Jaji as partaking in glorious victory, Bin Laden was helped by the daily dispatches of Jamal Khashoggi, and Bin Laden’s star was born in the Arab world. It was this moment in the spring of 1987 that Mustafa Hamid identifies as “the main cause of Al-Qaeda’s emergence as a separate organisation, and its rapid growth.” Hamid adds that Bin Laden’s money also played a significant role, since most other factions were broke by this point. See: Mustafa Hamid and Leah Farrall (2015), _The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, p. 111.

The Egyptians closest to Bin Laden seem to have been: [Ali Amin al-Rashidi](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/al-qaedas-first-military-emir/)
 (Abu Ubayda al-Panjshiri), [Muhammad Atef](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2018/02/05/profile-of-a-9-11-planner-muhammad-atef/)
 (Abu Hafs al-Masri), and Sayyed Imam al-Sharif (Dr. Fadl)—rather than Al-Zawahiri. Al-Sharif was close to Al-Zawahiri, though neither of them were major figures in the Arab-Afghan population. The narrative that “evil Egyptians” led Bin Laden astray in the late 1980s might have partly originated in a post-9/11 effort by Azzam’s partisans and/or the Saudi government to rewrite the history to make themselves look better. The main aspect, however, seems to be some Western authors and journalists having “overdramatized the intrigues in Peshawar”, where there really was “bad blood between Abdallah Azzam and some of the Egyptians”. _The Caravan_, pp. 359-61.

Azzam, though not a member of Al-Qaeda, was “not a very active opponent”: he largely did not understand what it was and where it was going, but his tendency to avoid intra-Muslim conflict meant Azzam generally did not oppose developments within the Arab-Afghan population, and was not displeased at the special forces-like capacity Al-Qaeda was providing to the Arab-Afghans \[_The Caravan_, p. 361\]. Minutes from a meeting in August 1988 are sometimes held up as the founding of Al-Qaeda. What those minutes actually show is Al-Qaeda as a pre-existing organisation, and an effort to poach from Azzam’s cadre—albeit subtly, since one of Azzam’s key lieutenants, Tamim al-Adnani, was present \[_The Arabs at War in Afghanistan_, pp. 108-12\]. In other words, Bin Laden was competing with Azzam, even if Azzam was not aware of it.

The exact timeline of Bin Laden’s arrival in Sudan is somewhat contested. The 9/11 Commission Report simply says: “Bin Ladin moved to Sudan in 1991”. Other sources than the link cited above give the arrival date as December 1991, for example, _A History of Modern Sudan_ (2008), by Robert Collins (p. 196), which describes Bin Laden being received “enthusiastically” by Al-Turabi. There are claims for other dates, both later (January 1992 seems to be quite a common one) and earlier—Dwight Hamilton and Kostas Rimsa claim (p. 94) in, _Terror Threat: International and Homegrown Terrorists and Their Threat to Canada_ (2007), that Bin Laden was “fully established” in Sudan by mid-September 1991—but the sourcing for these is less credible.

 under Ali Abdullah Saleh when it came to fighting the jihadists. Al-Banna was arrested in August 2010 in Yemen—it is from [the transcripts](https://www.aberfoylesecurity.com/?p=2038)
 of his interrogation that we know how early he established Al-Qaeda’s relations with the Huthis—but he was released _very_ quickly. This kind of catch-and-release, as well as the mysterious jailbreaks, were a feature of the Saleh government’s “War on Terror” policy.

, and a key part of the stitching that bound Al-Qaeda to its Iraqi affiliate before and after [the years of overt loyalty](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/08/30/the-islamic-states-relationship-with-al-qaeda/)
 from 2004 to 2006. Al-Badawi moved to Iraq in 2002, part of the Al-Qaeda cell that set up in Saddam’s Baghdad that spring, and [remained in contact](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 with Al-Banna afterwards: Al-Banna says he pushed for Al-Badawi’s promotion within Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and, interestingly, it [seems](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 Al-Banna was behind the confusion over Al-Badawi’s real identity, convincing Al-Badawi to adopt the _kunya_ “Abu Ayyub al-Masri”. By all accounts, Al-Banna and Al-Badawi were close socially as well as ideologically and organisationally, having [run Al-Qaeda’s operations together](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 for two years, from 1996 to 1998, and Al-Banna’s devotion to Al-Zawahiri appears absolute. Al-Banna (and Al-Badawi) were appointed leaders in Yemen [by Al-Zawahiri](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 in the 1990s, and in 2006 Al-Banna unhesitatingly stepped down as emir from what was not-yet called AQAP to make way for Nasir al-Wuhayshi after he had been freed in one of those Yemeni jailbreaks. Al-Banna [worked in Yemen](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/01/state-department-designates-founding-member-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula.php)
 with Muhammad al-Zawahiri, brother of the departed Al-Qaeda emir, and [Ahmad Mabruk](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2016/10/04/al-qaeda-in-syria-and-american-policy/)
, also an EIJ veteran, who accompanied the good doctor on the 1995 Russia trip and was a major jihadist figure in his own right. [Another of AQAP’s accounts](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/12/an-al-qaeda-commander-comes-out-from-the-shadows.php)
 tells of Al-Banna having been imprisoned in the late 1980s with another EIJ operative, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid (Saeed al-Masri), who had served time earlier in the 1980s, presumably simultaneous with if not alongside Al-Zawahiri, as part of the post-Sadat crackdown. Al-Yazid was Al-Qaeda’s financial emir at the time of 9/11 and rose to be number three in the organisation by about 2007, [appointed](https://www.bbc.com/news/10206180)
 to oversee the war in Afghanistan and as Bin Laden’s chief of staff. Al-Yazid was [killed](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/01/world/asia/01qaeda.html)
 in a drone strike in May 2010 and replaced by a Libyan, Jamal al-Misrati (Atiyya). Al-Yazid had been one of the point-men handling AQC’s relations with the IS movement. Al-Yazid [instructed Samir Hijazi](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2015/09/14/al-qaeda-central-in-syria/)
 (Faruq al-Suri) to go to Baghdad in early 2002, for example. (Hijazi broke with IS and [currently leads](https://kyleorton.substack.com/p/reduced-but-rebuilding-united-nations)

 have been found from after IS supposedly broke with Al-Qaeda in 2006 containing instructions to IS—often to leave Iran alone—and IS’s most famous spokesman, Taha Falaha (Abu Muhammad al-Adnani), [confirmed](https://kyleorton.co.uk/2014/05/13/isiss-spokesman-denounces-al-qaedas-leader-claims-isis-is-the-victim/)

The 9/11 Commission Report (p. 532) notes that KSM claimed Al-Zawahiri was opposed to the 9/11 attacks, imploring Bin Laden to adhere to Taliban emir Mullah Muhammad Umar’s injunction after the Embassy bombings against using Afghanistan as a base to attack the U.S., but “other detainees” said Al-Zawahiri was “squarely behind” Bin Laden, which seems to be the truth. It is possible KSM was trying to exclude other jihadists from “credit” for the “Planes Operation”.

. At the time, those of us watching Syria knew that something was different about the strike—Abu al-Khayr’s car was still intact, except for a section of roof on one side—and then it happened several more times.

: “\[Al-Zawahiri\] used his authority across Al-Qaeda’s global network of regional affiliates and followers to provide strategic direction and continually urging attacks on the United States and reinforcing the prioritization of the United States as Al-Qaeda’s primary enemy. … He built an organizational model that allowed him to lead the global network, even from relative isolation. And he was one of the last remaining figures who carried this kind of \[status\] significance”.

On 29 July 2022, Siraj gave an [interview to an Indian outlet](https://www.news18.com/news/world/exclusive-afghanistan-needs-indias-help-desperately-to-secure-peaceful-environment-taliban-interior-minister-haqqani-5670295.html)
 saying: “Al-Qaeda … has no presence in Afghanistan and is no more of a threat and the world should not feel threatened about the already dead outfit.” It’s obviously amusing enough given Al-Zawahiri being killed in Kabul two days later, and more so once it is understood that Siraj is also a member of Al-Qaeda and was speaking from Afghanistan.

Carlotta Gall’s _The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014_ goes as far as one can on the present evidence in describing Pakistan’s concealment of Bin Laden up to 2011. Whether ever detail transpires to be true on that specific issue, it is an excellent description of the shameful situation the West got into in Afghanistan, paying Pakistan to pretend to help us, as it barely concealed the fact it orchestrated the jihadist mayhem that killed our soldiers and thousands of Afghan civilians. In terms of last year, the White House spokesman was asked whether Pakistan had been warned about the drone heading for Al-Zawahiri, and [pointedly responded](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/08/02/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-august-2-2022/)
, “There were no notifications in advance”. Any such notification to Pakistan would have led to Al-Qaeda’s leader being tipped off.

Biden made a [strange statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/30/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-the-administrations-student-debt-relief-program/)
 (even stranger if you see the video) on 30 June: “Do you remember what I said about Afghanistan? I said Al-Qaeda would not be there. I said it wouldn’t be there. I said we’d get help from the Taliban. What’s happening now? What’s going on? Read your press. I was right.” The “help from the Taliban” line was particularly odd, since Biden had needed to order the strike on Al-Zawahiri precisely because the Taliban were _not_ helping against Al-Qaeda, and were in fact harbouring its leader in their capital. In the year since, the evidence has piled up all in the same direction. The U.N. Monitoring Team report in June painted an alarming picture of what the ISI network is doing in Afghanistan—and makes clear that it is all components of that network: “The link between the Taliban and both Al-Qaida and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) \[the ‘Pakistani Taliban’\] remains strong and symbiotic. A range of terrorist groups have greater freedom of manoeuvre under the Taliban … They are making good use of this, and the threat of terrorism is rising in both Afghanistan and the region”. Etc. Etc. A decent summary of the report is [available here](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/un-warns-of-risk-of-terrorism-from-afghanistan/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim states that the image shows the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. However, the image search results indicate that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran, Iran, on the same date. The geolocation results do not include Iran. Therefore, the image does not depict the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

The claim also describes the nature of the strike. However, there is no information about the nature of the strike in the provided evidence.

Based on the evidence, the claim is false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/brushing-off-trumps-threat-hamas-says-it-will-only-free-hostages-for-a-lasting-truce): 
Content: PBS published an article about Hamas's response to Trump's threat. The article includes an image of a protest related to the hostages <image:8007>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump made a statement regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas on January 7, 2025. The PBS article indicates that Trump made a threat, and the claim provides a specific quote.

To verify the claim, the exact wording of Trump's statement needs to be checked. The CNN, NPR, and Foreign Policy articles are the most likely sources to find the quote.

The evidence indicates that Donald Trump made a statement on January 7, 2025, regarding Israeli hostages held by Hamas. However, the exact wording of the claim, "if Israeli hostages held by Hamas 'are not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East'," has not been verified. The CNN, NPR, and Foreign Policy articles are the most likely sources to find the quote.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel."

## Actions
```
image_search("DNA test Israel law")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include a source with no content ([Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280846000_Genetic_citizenship_DNA_testing_and_the_Israeli_Law_of_Return)). Another source ([Source](https://welcome-israel.com/jewish-genealogy/jewish-dna-test)) contains an image of a DNA test report <image:8031>.

Additionally, a source ([Source](https://en.idi.org.il/articles/26956)) includes an image of a DNA strand <image:8033>.


## Elaboration
The evidence includes images of a DNA test report and a DNA strand, suggesting that DNA testing is performed in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether it is legal or illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

The first source ([Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280846000_Genetic_citizenship_DNA_testing_and_the_Israeli_Law_of_Return)) might contain information about the legality of DNA testing in Israel, but the content is not available.

From [Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/): 
Content: The search result includes an image of a DNA strand and a test tube <image:8046>.


## Elaboration
The evidence includes an image from a source ([Source](https://lawoffice.org.il/en/aliyah-to-israel-by-dna-test/)) that discusses using DNA tests for Aliyah to Israel. This suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, as it is used in the context of immigration. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether DNA tests are legal or illegal.

More information is needed to verify the claim.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include two sources. One source from Human Rights Watch ([Source](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution)) contains an image with text about Israeli policies <image:8070>. The other source ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05649-9)) includes an image of a graph related to population genetics <image:8073>. Neither source provides information about the legality of DNA testing in Israel.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population of Gaza. The OCHA map indicates a current population of 2.1 million as of November 16, 2024, while an anera.org graph shows the population in 2023 as 2.2 million. The BBC article states that over one million people were displaced within ten days of October 7, 2023. The OCHA map also shows that the population in October 2023 was 750K, and in November 2024, it is 340-375K.

Based on the provided data, it is impossible to verify the claim that the population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023. The evidence suggests a decrease in population, not an increase.

To verify the claim, the exact population figures for October 7, 2023, and the present day are needed.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population of Gaza. The OCHA map indicates a current population of 2.1 million as of November 16, 2024, while an anera.org graph shows the population in 2023 as 2.2 million. The BBC article states that over one million people were displaced within ten days of October 7, 2023. The OCHA map also shows that the population in October 2023 was 750K, and in November 2024, it is 340-375K.

Based on the provided data, it is impossible to verify the claim that the population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023. The evidence suggests a decrease in population, not an increase.

To verify the claim, the exact population figures for October 7, 2023, and the present day are needed.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence contains conflicting information about the population of Gaza, with some sources indicating a decrease and others suggesting different figures. The claim of a 2.02% increase cannot be verified due to the lack of precise population data for the specified dates.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023."

## Actions
```
image_search("Gaza population increase October 7 2023")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
OCHA's map of the Gaza Strip, dated November 16, 2024, indicates a current population of 2.1 million. The population in October 2023 was 750K, and in November 2024, it is 340-375K. The BBC published an article showing that within 10 days of October 7, more than one million of Gaza's 2.2 million people had been forced to leave their homes. As of January 14, 2025, an estimated 1.9 million people are internally displaced. An anera.org graph shows the population in 2023 as 2.2 M.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the population of Gaza. The OCHA map indicates a current population of 2.1 million as of November 16, 2024, while an anera.org graph shows the population in 2023 as 2.2 million. The BBC article states that over one million people were displaced within ten days of October 7, 2023. The OCHA map also shows that the population in October 2023 was 750K, and in November 2024, it is 340-375K.

Based on the provided data, it is impossible to verify the claim that the population increased by 2.02% since October 7, 2023. The evidence suggests a decrease in population, not an increase.

To verify the claim, the exact population figures for October 7, 2023, and the present day are needed.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence continues to present conflicting information. The BBC article states that the population of Gaza was 2.2 million before October 7, 2023, and that over one million people were displaced within ten days of that date. The Statista graph shows a population increase over the years, but it does not provide specific figures for October 7, 2023, or the present day.

Based on the available information, it is still impossible to verify the claim. The evidence suggests a decrease in population due to displacement, but the exact figures needed to calculate the percentage change are missing.

To verify the claim, the exact population figures for October 7, 2023, and the present day are needed.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. Multiple sources, including a [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20415675), indicate significant displacement of over one million people from Gaza since October 7, 2023, suggesting a population decrease, not an increase. While a [Statista graph](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1422981/gaza-total-population/) shows overall population growth over time, it lacks the specific data needed to verify the claim's percentage increase.

The attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 17 and 18, in Lebanon with exploding walkie-talkies and [pagers](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)
 apparently targeted members of [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
. The Iran-backed political party and militant group holds Israel responsible for the [strikes that killed at least 29 persons and injured around 2,800 people](/en/lebanon-explosions-stoke-fear-of-hezbollah-retaliation/a-70261978)
.

In the aftermath of the explosions a lot of fake images, videos and claims have been spreading online claiming to show the incidents.

DW's [fact checking team](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 checked three viral claims.

Are iPhones exploding in Lebanon as well?
-----------------------------------------

**Claim:** "An iPhone was also blown up in Lebanon", [a social media user wrote on X](https://archive.ph/yYA3i "External link — a social media user wrote on X")
 (formerly Twitter) sharing an image of a destroyed iPhone with more than 800.000 views.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a destroyed iphone is not related to the current attacks in LebanonImage: X

A reverse image search reveals that this image is old and has nothing to do with the current incidents in Lebanon. The image of the exploded iPhone dates back [to March 2021](https://www.cairo24.com/1166674 "External link — to March 2021")
 when Egyptian news outlet Cairo24 reported an iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo. The incident caused a fire and injured a child.

Did exploding solar panels hurt more than 500 individuals?
----------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** Other social media users insinuated that Israel had caused solar panels to burst into flames. "Lebanon: Sabotaged solar panels have started significant electrical fires. Over 500 individuals have been reported injured so far", [this user wrote](https://archive.ph/rkYv2 "External link — this user wrote")
 featuring an Israeli flag. Attached was an image of burning solar panels and a house on fire.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This claim about burning solar panels in Lebanon is false as wellImage: X

There are no documented cases of exploding solar panels in the current attacks in Lebanon. The image is a collage of two old pictures.

[Via a reverse image search](https://archive.ph/kp26N "External link — Via a reverse image search")
we find both images: [The image on the left](https://perma.cc/6TAZ-EPZ9 "External link — The image on the left")
, showing burning solar panels, dating back to[an X-post](https://x.com/FSRI_org/status/1215631166226817024 "External link — an X-post")
 from February 2020. In the post, the US-American Fire Safety Research Institute shared an article about the safety of photovoltaic systems along with the image.

The second photo shows a burning house [dates back to December 2020](https://www.saobserver.net/news/update-westside-home-fire-a-total-loss-not-suspicious-3723448 "External link — dates back to December 2020")
. The fire incident took place in Canada and not in Lebanon.

Did this laptop explode on September 19 in Lebanon?
---------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "19-09-2024 – Explosion in Laptops”, a social media user wrote on X [posting a photo of a charred laptop](https://archive.ph/5axnH "External link — posting a photo of a charred laptop")
.

**DW Fact check:** False.

This image of a charred laptop does not have anything to do with the current explosions in LebanonImage: X

The user added "Mossad is unstoppable” blaming the Israeli secret service for the explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and now laptops as well. So far, there is no evidence that Israel or Mossad is responsible for the attacks. Pagers and walkie-talkies indeed exploded killing and injuring people. But no reliable reports exist that laptops did, as well.

The shared image gives no evidence for something alike either. [A reverse image search](https://archive.ph/5H4Cy "External link — A reverse image search")
 shows that the image dates back to [at least 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/lcljyb/just_got_my_hands_on_an_engineering_sample_3090/?rdt=64930 "External link — at least 2021")
 when it was posted on Reddit.

So far, only pagers and walkie-talkies exploded in Lebanon according to both regional and international news. While Hezbollah and Iran both hold Israel accountable for the explosions it's not confirmed who is responsible for the attacks.

If you want to know more about how the explosions in Lebanon happened technically, DW Science explains it [in this article](/en/exploding-hezbollah-pagers-how-did-it-happen/a-70250960)

[!Not just pagers: iPhones, laptops, electronic locks and other devices exploded in Lebanon today <image:343>](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/photo_2024-09-18_18-09-13.jpg)

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_7420.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_7420.mp4)

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video\_2024-09-18\_17-50-16.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/video_2024-09-18_17-50-16.mp4)

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

[https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG\_8469.mp4](https://itc.ua/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_8469.mp4)

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

Israel’s Pager Attack Has Cooked More Than Just iPhone Sales in China
=====================================================================

![cs_opinion_img](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2020'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

The pager attack in Lebanon has triggered a trust crisis among Chinese consumers of Western-made electronic products, such as iPhone. In the view of Chinese strategist, Prof. Wang Xiangsui, this once again proves that Western-led economic globalization is only a stage in history, not the final destination.

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)The pager explosions have taken about 12 lives and injured around 3000 people on September 17  

Last week, the pager attack in Lebanon captured global attention. This form of attack not only triggered panic among the Lebanese people but also shook global confidence in economic globalization. This is because Israel has opened Pandora’s box of using civilian product supply chains for military objectives.

The remote-controlled explosions in Lebanon came in two waves. In the first wave, the devices targeted were primarily pagers used by Hezbollah members. According to The Washington Post and other Western media, the explosives were pre-installed in the batteries. But in the second wave, the explosions extended to everyday civilian items like mobile phones, laptops, cars, and even electric razors used in barbershops. Chinese media outlet Guancha reported that this is done by mixing batteries with remote-controlled detonators into ordinary batteries in the Lebanon market, which were then randomly installed into these devices during repairs.

This is almost akin to randomly poisoning a city’s water supply, resulting in widespread, uncontrollable collateral damage. At least 32 people, including two children, were killed and thousands more injured. In fact, it aligns closely with the United Nations General Assembly’s definition of terrorism, reaffirmed since 1994: “criminal acts intended to cause public fear.”

In the realm of global economics, this type of terrorism is causing an alarming effect on a conceptual level.

For example, on Twitter(X), a photo of an iPhone detonated in Lebanon has sparked widespread attention. And on Chinese social media Weibo, Phoenix News created a vote, asking related to trending news, do you believe iPhones’ batteries have security issues? — with 45.6% of 8121 respondents voting “yes.”

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

This incident has triggered a direct trust crisis among Chinese consumers toward Western electronic products. Three days after the pager attack, the iPhone 16 was launched in mainland China. Normally, consumers would have to queue at stores to get the latest iPhone, often paying scalpers extra. But this year, the iPhone was already being sold at a discount on e-commerce platforms.

On the other hand, Huawei saw a surge in support. This is because, in the Lebanese explosions, manufacturers from Taiwan island and Japan were unaware that their products had been converted into bombs, claiming that external agents or suppliers had tampered with them. Chinese consumers, recalling that U.S. sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction have prevented Huawei from sourcing parts from Western manufacturers, noted that Huawei has increased the localization of its supply chain. Many Chinese commentators argue that U.S. sanctions have, ironically, “de-risked” Huawei phones.

The term “de-risking” was originally popularized by Western media during Trump’s trade war with China. But as Israel’s actions escalate, it seems Western media have lost control of their narrative. After all, when the West imposed long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese smartphones, electric vehicles, and 5G suppliers, it claimed that its safety standards were high and its detection methods sophisticated. These claims only hold water if consumers believe in them, making such jurisdiction legitimate in democratic societies. Now, however, Israel’s covert actions have undermined that legitimacy. If Western countries and Taiwan authorities cannot prove that they can protect their supply chain from the Mossad, they will lose their authority to define “safety standards” in China and around the world.

This, in turn, offers a significant advantage to Chinese companies. Going forward, Huawei and other manufacturers will no longer need to promote compliance with EU or U.S. standards to endorse product quality. Instead, labels like “Produced according to Chinese standards” or “Entirely non-Western suppliers” could become new selling points. This signals a potential shift in consumer value judgments from a unipolar world dominated by Western standards to a multipolar world where “Chinese standards” compete in parallel. This could reshape the direction of economic globalization, introducing new dimensions and market entry rules.

In the past, China made extensive adjustments to its economic policies and production standards to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly in food safety. However, during incidents like the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge and the COVID-19 pandemic, China’s technical standards for inspecting seafood and meat products were notably higher than those of Western countries. With global consumer health in mind, this raises the question: Is China now better positioned to set international food hygiene standards? And in other sectors where China has similarly higher standards, shouldn’t they also be adopted by the WTO?

Clearly, if Western countries are genuinely committed to promoting the cross-border flow of production factors—allowing each country to capitalize on its strengths within the global market—then when it comes to ensuring supply chain security and setting safety standards for certain products, China evidently has a comparative advantage, to lead a higher quality economic globalization.

If the global market is truly free, then perhaps it’s time to move beyond a globalization dominated by Western-developed countries and shift toward a multipolar globalization that better reflects the comparative advantages of all nations.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there were explosions involving Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024. However, the provided image search results do not show any images of exploded iPhones. The India Today article ([https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hezbollah-devices-explode-lebanon-pager-blasts-beirut-israel-2602266-2024-09-18](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/hezbollah-devices-explode-lebanon-pager-blasts-beirut-israel-2602266-2024-09-18)) shows images of exploded pagers, not iPhones.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-device-explosions-mainly-hurt-group-psychologically-analysts-say/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-device-explosions-mainly-hurt-group-psychologically-analysts-say/)) and NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pager-new-device-explosions-lebanon-hezbollah-rcna171637](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pager-new-device-explosions-lebanon-hezbollah-rcna171637)) report on explosions in Lebanon involving Hezbollah devices in September 2024. <image:8108> <image:8110>


## Elaboration
The new evidence from the image search confirms the occurrence of explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, as reported by The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-device-explosions-mainly-hurt-group-psychologically-analysts-say/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-device-explosions-mainly-hurt-group-psychologically-analysts-say/)) and NBC News ([https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pager-new-device-explosions-lebanon-hezbollah-rcna171637](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pager-new-device-explosions-lebanon-hezbollah-rcna171637)). However, these sources do not mention or show any images of exploded iPhones.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows an iPhone that exploded during the pager attacks remains unsupported by the evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles and images related to Palestinians and Israeli tanks. One source, [Source](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_tank_fired_shell_kills_palestinian_girl_in_gaza_hospital), contains an image of a Palestinian girl in a hospital <image:8118>.

Another source, [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-palestinian-woman-had-twins-after-trying-for-10-years-an-israeli-strike-killed-them-both), discusses a Palestinian woman in Gaza <image:8119>. Al Jazeera published an article about Israeli tanks <image:8120> [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/24/israeli-tanks-roll-jenin-palestinians-prepare-lengthy-invasion).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide context about Israeli tanks and Palestinians in Gaza. The geolocate results suggest the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. More information is needed to verify the claim.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Al Jazeera published an article about Israeli tanks <image:8120> [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/24/israeli-tanks-roll-jenin-palestinians-prepare-lengthy-invasion).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The image search results provide context about Israeli tanks and Palestinians in Gaza. The geolocate results suggest the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. More information is needed to verify the claim.

The image search results provide context about Israeli tanks and Palestinians in Gaza. The geolocate results suggest the image was most likely taken in Palestine. However, the evidence does not confirm the claim that the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

Content: Al Jazeera published an article about flooding in Gaza, which includes an image of a woman near a tent <image:8127>.


## Elaboration
The image search results show images of Palestinians in Gaza, including a woman near a tent. However, none of the search results confirm the claim that the image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.

The evidence is insufficient to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC published an article about an Israeli tank (<image:8128>). NBC News published an article about Israeli tanks entering central Rafah (<image:8129>). The Guardian published an article about Israeli tanks on the Gaza border (<image:8130>). None of the articles mention a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. The image searches provide context about Israeli tanks and Palestinians in Gaza, but they do not show a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes. The claim is therefore unverified.

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל: לפני זמן קצר נורה טיל לעבר בית פרטי ביישוב אביבים שבמועצה האזורית מרום הגליל. נגרם נזק לבית, לא היו נפגעים.

ראש המועצה האזורית מרום הגליל עמית סופר: "עוד בית שניזוק באביבים. היישוב חטף עד כה עשרות טילים מסוגים שונים והנזקים לרכוש הם בהיקפים גדולים ומשמעותיים כך גם יישובים סמוכים. כל מתקפה כזו משפיעה על כל היישובים שלא פונו. אני מקווה שמינוי הפרויקטור ייבשר את הזרמת התקציבים והמענים הכה דחופים בצפון"

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

الصحفي محمد العويد

##### الصحفي محمد العويد ابن محافظة درعا، يتحدث لدرعا 24 عن تحديات وآفاق الإعلام السوري: نحو بناء إعلام حر ومستقل في مرحلة ما بعد النظام

**يشهد الإعلام السوري اليوم مرحلة مفصلية بعد سقوط النظام الذي أحكم قبضته على الصحافة ومؤسساتها لعقود طويلة**، ولا سيما خلال السنوات الثلاث عشرة الأخيرة. ومع هذا التحوّل، انفتح الباب أمام أفقٍ جديدٍ يطمح إليه الصحفيون والمؤسسات الإعلامية في سوريا، لتمكين العمل الإعلامي الحر والمستقل. ومع ذلك، فإن الطريق نحو تنظيم هذا القطاع وضمان حرية التعبير لا يزال مليئاً بالتحديات.

في هذا السياق **أجرت شبكة درعا 24 مقابلةً خاصّة مع الصحفي [محمد العويد](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100002329474787)
 من أبناء محافظة درعا**، للحديث عن هذا المشهد والكثير من الأمور المتعلقة به وتحديات وأولويات العمل الإعلامي في هذه المرحلة. يتناول الحوار قضايا مثل واقع الاتحادات التي أُنشئت مؤخرًا، وظروف الناشطين والصحفيين في البلاد، وأداء الحكومة في الجانب الإعلامي، والدور الذي يجب أن تضطلع به المؤسسات الصحفية لدعم التحول الإعلامي في سوريا.

**ينحدر الصحفي محمد العويد، من بلدة معربة في الريف الشرقي من محافظة درعا.** وهو خريج جامعة دمشق قسم الصحافة. عمل مديراً لفرع وكالة سانا في درعا، وفي صحف سورية أخرى قبل اندلاع الثورة في 2011. وعمل بعدها في تلفزيون “سوريا الشعب” الذي أُنشئ في عمّان في الأردن، حيث كان يقيم هناك. بعدها في تلفزيون “18 آذار” للمعارضة السورية. وفي عام 2014، هاجر إلى فرنسا. عمل من هناك مع تلفزيون “أورينت” كمراسل، وكذلك في موقع “زمان الوصل”. كما تعاون مع “تلفزيون سوريا”. وحالياً، ينشر مقالاته في عدد من المواقع الإلكترونية بصفة مستقلة، وليست دائمة.

كيف تُقيّم المشهد الإعلامي في سوريا اليوم بعد سقوط النظام الذي كان يُحكم قبضته بشكل كبير على الإعلام الرسمي وكل وسائل الإعلام في مناطق سيطرته؟ وما هي الآفاق التي تتطلع إليها من الإعلام السوري في المستقبل؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المشهد الإعلامي يعني – مرحليّاً – خلال هذه المرحلة لا يمكن تقييمه بالأدوات الطبيعية المعتادة؛ لأن الكل يشعرون أن هذه المرحلة هي مرحلة انتقالية، مرحلة تأتي بعد انهيار نظام الأسد وهروبه، وحل أكبر مؤسسات الدولة الأمنية والعسكرية. وبالتالي، **حالة الحرية – إذا جاز التعبير – في أوجها، في ذروتها، بدون أي ضوابط، بدون أي قواعد، في حالة من عدم المسؤولية الإعلامية.** لأن هناك سعة أفقية في انتشار الشائعات والمصادر غير المسؤولة، وعدم التأكد من الأخبار في حالة متناقضة بالقدر الذي نرى فيه الوجه الإعلامي الإيجابي من الحريات التي سادت في سوريا بعد فترة كبت طالت أكثر من عقود، نرى أيضاً غياب أدوات الدولة أو مؤسساتها التي يفترض أن تكون هي المصدر الرئيسي لفهم هذه التحولات، أو المصدر الرئيسي للأخبار التي تخاطب الناس أو تكون مصدراً للمعلومات منها.

كيف يمكن بناء إعلام يتمتع بالحرية في سوريا؟ وما هي التحديات التي تعيق تحقيق ذلك في المرحلة القادمة؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بتقديري، أولاً، يفترض أن يتحمل الجميع المسؤولية كشارع، كصحفيين، كنخب سياسية، وأن تكون على قدر المسؤولية. لأن المرحلة لها خصوصيتها، وثانياً، الشكل الطبيعي أن تبادر الناس، أن تبادر هذه القوى المجتمعية في الإعلام والسياسة إلى إعادة ترتيب أوراقها، إعادة ترتيب أولوياتها. وأن تكون إذا لم تكن الشراكة متاحة الآن مع أدوات الدولة أو سلطة الدولة، فلتكن في الجهة المقابلة. لكن تقديري أنها تحتاج بعض الوقت، لأنه الأسباب الموضوعية لغياب هذه الكتل التي يفترض أن تكون صلب أو مقومات الحريات الإعلامية، إن واقع المعارضة بعد العام 2011 لم يكن خاضعاً بالمعنى الحقيقي لبنية المؤسسات. وإذا شاءت ووجدت مؤسسة، فهي تحكم جمهورها السوري المنتشر في أصقاع العالم، في كل دول العالم. **فالآليات التي كانت سائدة خلال فترة المعارضة وإعلامها هي أقرب لمرحلة الفوضى وليس التنظيم**، لأنه أنت لا تحكم في جغرافية محددة، أنت توجّه خطاباً، وردّ هذا الخطاب من الجمهور لا تخضع لأي قواعد.

الآن الفرصة الاستثنائية هي أنه **أصبح للسوريين وطن وجغرافيا يمكن الالتزام بقواعدها وآلياتها،** كما هو في بقية البلدان، بدءًا من الجوار السوري في الأردن أو الشمال التركي، وصولًا إلى دول العالم الآخر. فبتقديري أنه **يجب أن نكون صريحين مع أنفسنا وتتحمل هذه القوى الجديدة مسؤولياتها وأولوياتها وواجباتها ووظيفتها**، من خلال أولاً تنظيم صفوفها، ومن خلال أن تكون هي الرافع الحقيقي للحريات. ولا نعول وننتظر حتى تمنحنا السلطة الحريات على طبق من ذهب.

ما هي الأولويات العاجلة التي يجب على المؤسسات الإعلامية والجهات الفاعلة تحقيقها لضمان حرية الصحافة في سوريا الجديدة؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن ترتيب هذه الأولويات سيكون مرهوناً بوجه السلطة القادمة. على الأقل خلال شهر آذار، سيتم إعلان تشكيل الحكومة، ومن المفترض أن يصدر عن هذا التشكيل لاحقاً – بالتوازي مع المؤتمر الوطني – البيان الدستوري. كما يُفترض أن يصدر معه بعض التعاميم أو القرارات التي تُحدد وتشرح وتؤطر مجموعة القوانين الناظمة للحياة السياسية والإعلامية. لأنه بدون هذا الجانب السياسي أولاً، لا يمكن للقوى السياسية أن تعمل.

بمعنى آخر، في الجانب الإعلامي، ما هي الأطر التي أعمل كصحفي بموجبها؟ هذه الأمور غير واضحة حالياً، لأنه ليس لدي أُطر ولا قوانين، والأمور متروكة الآن. لكن ا**لعاجل، بتقديري، هو أن تتولى القوى السياسية، ومن ضمنها القوى المدنية في الجانب الإعلامي، المسؤولية وأن تتهيأ لهذا الدور**. يجب أن تكون هذه القوى جاهزة، وأن تكون قادرة على ضم كوادرها والاستعداد للمرحلة القادمة. إذا لم تكن المؤسسات الإعلامية متاحة حالياً، فعلى الأقل في المرحلة القادمة، **يجب أن تكون هذه المؤسسات جاهزة إلى جانب المعارضة، وأن يكون لديها خطابها وبنودها التي ستطلبها من السلطة وتتناقش معها حولها،** سواء ما يتعلق بالإعلام أو بحريات الصحافة أو بالقانون الإلكتروني. كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن تبادر الجهات المدنية والصحفيين والنخبة الثقافية إلى تهيئة أوراقها، حتى تكون جاهزة في المرحلة القادمة.

**أعتقد أن أبرز تحدي حالياً هو تأخر السلطة السياسية في إعلان موقفها، على الأقل إعلامياً**. ما هي الأجواء التي ينبغي على الصحافة أن تعمل بموجبها. هل تترك بهذا الشكل غير المنضبط، ولكن في حدود معقولة؟ أم نعود إلى حالة من التنظيم؟ لأن أهم ما في الإعلام – إذا جاز التعبير بين هلالين – هو “لعبة المُشاكسة” مع الحكومة، وكل مُشاكسة تستوجب أن يكون هناك قواعد ضبط بين الطرفين. **للأسف، حتى الآن، غير واضح تماماً ما هي القواعد بين الطرفين. هل هو دستور 2012؟ هل هو قانون المطبوعات السوري؟** يبدو أن الأمور تُركت بهذا الشكل.

**لذلك، أعتقد أن أول الأولويات التي يجب أن تكون حاضرة وهو أن تتهيأ الأطراف المدنية لتلعب هذا الدور، وأن تكون على الأقل جاهزة فيما إذا ذهبت السلطة السياسية إلى اعتماد قانون ما. يجب أن يكون لديها النموذج المقنع والحضور الجماهيري.**

كيف يمكن للإعلام أن يساهم في بناء مستقبل سوريا الجديد؟ وما هو الدور الذي يجب أن تلعبه الحكومة لدعم هذا التوجه؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

جزء من وظيفة الإعلام دوماً أن يلعب دوراً محورياً في أي مجتمع، سواء في سوريا أو غيرها. وبالتأكيد، في الحالة السورية، هذا الدور مُضاعف بسبب الظروف الاستثنائية التي تمر بها البلاد. **في المجتمعات المستقرة، عادةً ما يلعب الإعلام دوراً ضمن قواعد السوق، حيث يكون الدافع هو السبق الصحفي، الشهرة، التسريبات، والعناوين المغرية** التي تجذب الجمهور وتزيد من انتشار المؤسسات الصحفية. هذه الممارسات تعتبر جزءاً من لعبة “العرض والطلب” في السوق الإعلامي.

لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً. **أحد التحديات الرئيسية هو أن الإعلام يجب أن يضع القيمة الأخلاقية في أولوية عمله – أي خبر قد يخلق بلبلة كبيرة في المجتمع السوري -، خاصةً أن بنية الدولة ما زالت هشة وغير مستقرة.** لذلك، أعتقد أن سلم الأولويات في الحالة السورية يجب أن يختلف قليلاً، وأن يُراعى في الحالة السورية **أن تكون الأولوية للبناء وليس فقط للممارسات الإعلامية التي نراها في المجتمعات المستقرة**، والتي لديها باع طويل في تحمّل أعراف الصحافة الجديدة وحقها في السوق. في الحالة السورية، الوضع يحتاج من الإعلامي أن يرتب أولوياته بشكل مختلف، مع **التركيز بشكل خاص على الأولويات الأخلاقية للمهنة.** يجب أن يكون المقياس الأخلاقي والحالة الوطنية، أي: هل تتحمل الناس هذه الأنشطة الصحفية؟ التي عادةً ما تكون حق للصحفي.

بالتالي، لا بأس بتقديري من تعزيز هذه التوصيفات والبنية الأخلاقية في الصحافة، على الأقل مرحلياً، حتى يستقيم بنيان المجتمع السوري وتعود الصحافة إلى دورها الطبيعي.

ما تقييمك للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة الجديدة فيما يتعلق بالإعلام؟ وكيف يمكن للإعلام أن يلعب دوراً رقابياً على أداء الحكومة في هذه المرحلة؟ وهل تتقبل الحكومة هذا الدور؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

بالنسبة للخطوات التي اتخذتها الحكومة، **حتى الآن لم تتخذ خطوات حقيقية**. ما نراه هو الطبيعي. بعد تحرير دمشق، حيث أن دمشق بأهميتها، التي تعتبر مأساة القرن، نحن أمام مشهد بالغ الأهمية من الطبيعي أن يستقطب كل الإعلام العالمي والمؤسسات الإعلامية. **أعتقد أن الإدارة المؤقتة ربما سهلت – إذا جاز التعبير – أو تعاطت مع الأمر بإيجابية، لأنها تريد إيصال رسالة مفادها أن هذه المرحلة تختلف عن مرحلة الأسد، التي كانت تتطلب الموافقات الأمنية وزيارات الفروع الأمنية،** وكانت هناك محدودية في قدرة الصحف والمؤسسات على العمل بحرية.

**الإدارة الجديدة قدمت رسالة سياسية أكثر من كونها إعلامية**، لأن الناس في الإعلام تنتظر بنية إعلامية وقانونية واضحة حتى تستطيع أن تستمر، وحتى تعرف ما هي الأرضية الصلبة التي تقف عليها. هذا الأمر ضروري حتى تستطيع أن تلعب دورها الرقابي على الإعلام، وهذا هو المطلوب. لكن موقف الحكومة حتى الآن – وهذا نعزوه للظرف الذي تمر به الإدارة الجديدة، وهي مرحلة انتقالية أو حتى ما قبل الانتقالية – لأنها استلمت بلداً ينوء من الخراب في كل هياكله، بما فيها الهياكل الإعلامية.

**سواء قبلت الحكومة الدور الرقابي للإعلام أم لم تقبله، فاعتقد أنه إذا استطاعت القوى الإعلامية والمنظمات الصحفية وكتلة الصحفيين والمثقفين أن تكون جاهزة ومنظمة لهذا الدور**، فسيقوم الإعلام بأداء دوره الرقابي بشكل طبيعي، ولكن ضمن الأطر والشروط التي سيتم الاتفاق عليها في المرحلة القادمة.

ما هي أبرز الأولويات التي يجب على الإعلاميين السوريين التركيز عليها خلال الفترة الانتقالية؟
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بالأولويات، أعتقد أنه من الصعب أن أكون جزءاً من الحالة الصحفية وفي نفس الوقت أطالب بإنهاء حالة الفردية وتعزيز القيم الأخلاقية لمهنة الصحافة. أفهم أن الأمر ليس سهلاً، لأن الصحفي يعيش كما الشاعر ليقول فيها للناس: “ها أنا هنا كصحفي، لدي سبق، لدي تحقيق، لدي… إلخ”. لكن الحالة السورية، بما أنها حالة وطنية استثنائية، تستوجب سلم من الأولويات مختلفة قليلاً.

بدلاً من أن تكون الأولوية لدي كصحفي أو كمؤسسة إعلامية هي السبق الصحفي، يجب أن تكون الأولوية للقيمة الأخلاقية والمسؤولية الوطنية (كما أسلفت). هذا لا يعني إنهاء دوري كصحفي، بل يعني الانتقال من الحالة الفردية إلى حالة من المشاورة والتعاون مع زملائي في العمل ومع المؤسسة الإعلامية التي أنتمي إليها، ومؤسستي لديها تشبيك مع مؤسسات أخرى، وبالتالي نعيد ترتيب الأولويات بما يتناسب مع خصوصية الحالة السورية.

وهذا يعزز الدور المؤسساتي للإعلام ويعطي صورة أفضل من الصورة السابقة. قبل 13 سنة، **كنا نعيش حالة فردية، بل وحتى حالة فصائلية في الإعلام. الآن، نحن أمام حالة وطنية تستوجب الدقة والتعاون مع الآخرين أكثر من أي وقت مضى**. هذه الحالة تستوجب التركيز على القيم العليا، وأولها القيمة الوطنية وقيمة المواطنة والحريات. كل هذا يتطلب تخفيف حالة التفرد والذاتية التي نمارسها عادةً كصحفيين.

ما هو رأيك بالأفكار التي تدعو لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام – أسوةً بكثير من دول العالم – كخطوة لدعم حرية الصحافة؟ وهل تعتقد أن هناك بدائل أفضل لتنظيم القطاع الإعلامي؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

في قضية **الدعوة لإلغاء وزارة الإعلام، أعتقد أن هذا الطرح مبكرٌ جداً، خصوصاً في الحالة السورية**. صعوبة الأسئلة المطروحة اليوم، سواء كانت إعلامية أو سياسية أو دينية، وكل البرامج المقدمة، لا تراعي بشكل كافٍ الحالة الاستثنائية التي تمر بها سوريا. إذا نظرنا إلى دولة مستقرة مثل المملكة الأردنية، يمكن أن يثار نقاش حول إلغاء وزارة الإعلام، لأن هناك بنى مدنية ومؤسساتية قائمة منذ أكثر من خمسين سنة. لكن في الحالة السورية، الوضع مختلف تماماً.

**يجب أن نفهم خصوصية الحالة السورية البالغة الحساسية. القوى القادمة من المعارضة، والتي ستُدير البلد بشكل أو بآخر، لم تكن منضبطة خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية**. كانت هذه القوى مشتتة. لكن لأول مرة الجغرافيا السورية ستتعامل معها ضمن أطر قانونية. أنا في فرنسا، ملتزم بقانون الإعلام الفرنسي، لكني لست ملتزماً بالقانون التركي. الآن، في سوريا، أصبحت ملتزماً بالحالة السورية ككل. لأول مرة، تتاح فرصة لأن يكون المرسل والمستقبل في جغرافية واحدة تحكمها القواعد نفسها. هذا يحتاج إلى تأطير وإنهاء المرحلة السابقة التي كانت قائمة على الفوضى وعدم الانضباط.

ليس هناك قانون يحكم العلاقة بين تلفزيون سوريا في تركيا (الذي يعمل في المنطقة الحرة ولا يخضع للقوانين التركية) وبين جمهوره في أمريكا أو لبنان أو الأردن أو حتى داخل سوريا. الآن، لأول مرة، يفترض أن تتاح لعبة إعلامية مهمة جداً، حيث **يلتزم كل من المرسل والمستقبل بقواعد تندرج تحت قانون الإعلام السوري والقانون العام السوري بضوابطه وقواعده وتعريفاته**. هذا يحتاج إلى جهد كبير حتى نعتاد عليه.

في المراحل القادمة، بعد استقرار الدولة، **إذا رأى أهل التشريع أن البلد لم تعد بحاجة إلى وزارة الإعلام، فليكن ذلك. أنا مع دعاة توسيع مجال الحرية بلا حدود أمام المؤسسات الإعلامية، لكن في الحالة السورية، أقف وأشعر بالخوف. هذه الحالة هي أكثر الحالات التي تستوجب الضبط والقوننة، وليس العكس.**

كيف ترى الخطوات التي تُتخذ اليوم التي تهدف لتوحيد الإعلاميين والصحفيين في عدة مناطق في سوريا وتأسيس اتحادات؟ هل ترى أن هذا يساهم في توحيد الخطاب الإعلامي وتنظيم العمل، أم أنها قد تؤدي إلى تهديد حرية التعبير وطمس التنوع الإعلامي؟
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

مسألة توحيد الإعلاميين وتأسيس اتحادات، الأصل في ذلك أنه مباح والضروري والمهم، **لكنني شخصياً متخوف من جملة المشهد الإعلامي ومعطيات المشهد السياسي**. عادةً، في بلاد الشتات، اعتدنا أن أي مجموعة تعمل اتحاداً، وهذا الاتحاد يشابه – للأسف – الحالة السياسية أو أي حالة أخرى من التجمعات السورية. السبب في ذلك هو إنّه لم يكن لدينا “بيت” بالمعنى الحقيقي، فكنا نلجأ إلى وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والتعميمات المفتوحة، مع غياب القواعد الحقيقية.

**الخوف الآن هو من الاستسهال في المشهد السوري. بمعنى أنه غداً أو بعده، سنرى اتحادات صحفية في كل محافظة، وفي العاصمة دمشق، ستظهر اتحادات بأسماء متعددة**. المشكلة أن هذه الاتحادات، للأسف، هي استمرار للحالة السابقة، واستمرار للحالة التي كانت قائمة في الشتات. 

وهنا لا أريد أن يفهم كلامي كهجوم على أحد من زملائنا، **لكني أرى أن الإشكالية الحقيقية هي أننا نحاول صناعة “نمور من ورق” مجدداً، في حين أن الفرصة اليوم متاحة في دمشق لصناعة “نمور حقيقية”**.

بمعنى أن الراغبين في العمل السياسي والإعلامي، إصبح لدينا الآن وطن وبيت يمكننا اللقاء فيه، ولم نعد بحاجة إلى الأساليب القديمة التي تركت آثاراً سلبية. هذه فرصة حقيقية لبناء اتحادات قائمة على قواعد واضحة وفهم مشترك للآليات والدوافع.

النقطة الأهم هي أننا الآن أمام بيت، لكن الواجبات كثيرة. يجب أن نبدأ بتأثيث هذا البيت، تجميله، وتقديمه للجمهور. هل كل من في هذا البيت متوافق معك على الرؤية والقواعد والشروط والأولويات؟ من فهمي، أرى أن إشكالية الاتحادات التي تعلن عن نفسها بشكل متسارع تشبه إلى حد كبير القوى السياسية. ربما هذا بسبب خصوصية المرحلة، أو الظروف الراهنة، أو الرغبة في المشاركة، وهذا كله صحيح. لكن شخصياً، **أميل إلى أن قواعد وآليات تأسيس الاتحادات والروابط يجب أن تكون مختلفة عما يجري على أرض الواقع. لأنه لأول مرة سنكون أمام بُنى ستعتمد على ذاتها، وليس على دعم أو رعاية من هنا أو من هناك**. هذا البيت يجب أن يعتمد على اشتراكات الأعضاء. **هل الأعضاء في الحالة السورية جاهزون لهذا؟** أتمنى ذلك. هل الأعضاء سيكونون في حالة من الانضباط المؤسسي؟ أتمنى ذلك أيضاً.

بمعنى أن الاتحاد بهيكليته سيكون صاحب الموقف، وليس كل عضو بمفرده. الاتحاد سيكون ممثلاً للأعضاء، وهذه الجزئية لم نعتد عليها خلال السنوات الـ13 الماضية، حيث كانت الاتحادات التي نشأت عبارة عن صفحات تواصل اجتماعي، وبالتالي كانت أدوات ضبط الأعضاء غير ممكنة، فكيف تضبط أنا في فرنسا والآخر في تركيا والثالث في أمريكا والرابع في سوريا. الفرصة الآن هي أن أصبح هناك بيت يجمع الجميع، وهي فرصة تاريخية. لكن يجب أن نبادر كصحفيين إلى استثمار أقصى طاقاتنا في هذا الجانب.

ما أبرز التحديات التي تواجه الصحفيين في درعا في المرحلة الحالية، وكيف يمكن للإعلام المحلي أن يساهم في إيصال صوت المجتمعات المحلية للحكومة وللعالم؟ وما هو مستقبل العمل الصحفي في درعا وسوريا؟
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

فيما يتعلق بوضع درعا، هي جزء من الكل السوري. إذا استطاعت درعا أن تواكب الحالة الإعلامية السورية العامة، فهذا أمر جيد ويُحسب لها. بالتأكيد، أ**ي إعلام محلي يساهم في وصول صوت جمهوره أو المجتمع المحلي الذي يحاول أن يكون صوته.**

التحديات في درعا تشبه التحديات في المشهد الإعلامي السوري ككل. مرة أخرى، نحن أمام لحظة فارقة: أصبح لديك بيت بعد أن كان أعضاء هذا البيت، من الأب إلى الأبناء، مشتتين في كل أنحاء العالم. ولأول مرة، يستوجب بناء هذا البيت حضور الجميع ومشاركة الجميع. لكن يبدو أن ثمة ظروفاً أو معيقات ستكون عائقاً أمام اكتمال هذه العائلة. هذه المشكلة تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في درعا، كما تنطبق على الحالة الصحفية في عموم سوريا.

بمعنى، ماذا عن الزملاء الآخرين؟ هل سيعودون؟ هذا غير واضح. وماذا عن المؤسسات القائمة وكوادرها؟ ما هي الخيارات ؟ هذا أيضاً غير واضح. وماذا عن النشطاء الذين هم جزء كبير من المشهد الإعلامي السوري اليوم؟ حملوا أرواحهم على أيديهم وضحوا، ولدينا تضحيات جسيمة، نقف أمامها بإجلال. لكنه سؤال مرّ يحتاج إلى وضوح وإجابة: **ماذا تفعل أمام كتلة لا يستهان بها من الشباب من النشطاء الإعلاميين؟ ما هي الخيارات؟ هل تقول لهم “كفيتم ووفيتم”؟ بالتأكيد، هذا لا يستقيم. يجب أن نستفيد من تجربتهم، أولاً هذا حقهم أن يكونوا جزءاً من المشهد القادم، لكن ضمن أي شروط؟ ضمن أي معطيات؟**

كل هذه الأسئلة تشكل تحديات كبيرة تحتاج إلى إجابات. وأنا بتقديري أن الأهم هو أن تكون هذه المجموعة أو هؤلاء الصحفيين هم من يثيروا هذه الأسئلة، وهم من يعبر عن أدواتهم، ويعرفوا عن هويتهم. كل هذه الأسئلة يفترض أن يصوغوها هم، بمساعدة الآخرين، بمساعدة زملائهم السابقين، وبالتشبيك بين بعضهم. لكن عليهم هم أن يثيروا هذه الأسئلة.

ما هي رسالة محمد العويد للصحفيين في درعا؟ وكيف يمكنهم أن يكونوا أكثر فاعلية في المشهد؟
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

أعتقد أن المهم جداً هو أن يعمل كل ناشط، كل مواطن صحفي، وكل مهتم بالشأن الإعلامي في المحافظة، ويبادر بالتشبيك مع الآخرين من زملائه. **المهم الآن هو أن يفهم الجميع أن الأصوات الفردية لن يكون لها جدوى في المرحلة القادمة**، حتى لو كان مشهور أو ذو باع طويل لن يحقق شيئاً، لأن الأصوات الفردية لن تكون ذات جدوى أمام هذا المشهد بالغ التطور والمتسارع، والذي يعاد بناؤه في سوريا.

المشروع بهذا الحجم، على مستوى الوطن السوري، يحتاج بالمقابل إلى أن يكون هناك روافد أو أجنحة، وليس حالات فردية. **أنا من دعاة الحالة الجماعية في هذا المعنى. للصحفيين في درعا، وللمهتمين بالشأن الإعلامي**، أن تكون الدعوة دائمة إلى لقاءات دائمة على مدار الشهر أو الأسبوع، يتم فيها طرح هذه الأسئلة، تبدأ من الهوية: من نحن؟ ماذا ينتظرنا؟ ما هي حقوقنا؟ كيف نعمل؟ ما هي مصلحتنا؟ أن نشبك مع بعضنا البعض؟ هل نعمل كأفراد؟ كل هذه الأسئلة واستحقاقاتها مهمة، وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك محاولات للحصول على أجوبة لها، وليس أن تبقى مجرد أسئلة في الفضاء المفتوح. لأن التحديات كبيرة، والحقوق كثيرة. بدلاً من الحالة الفردية، التي من مشاكلها أنها تقبل أحياناً باللا شيء (مثلاً، أن تكون مراسلاً في درعا لمؤسسة في دمشق وأن يُقبل)، لكن بالحالة الجمعية أن يسأل ويكون خلفه مؤسسة أو مجموعة تسأل ما هي حقوقه.

يجب أن نعي أن المرحلة القادمة، حتى في حالة المواطن الصحفي، لم يعد من المقبول التطوع. العمل الإعلامي يجب أن ينتهي بهذه الطريقة. **العمل الإعلامي هو عمل يومي، مضني، إشكالي، بجوانبه المتعددة قانوني، وأحياناً يضعك في مواجهة السلطة أو الشارع.** كل هذه الأشياء يجب أن يكون ما يحميها، بدءاً من الجانب التعويض المالي وصولاً إلى الحقوق داخل المؤسسة التي تعمل بها.

لذلك، أنا أميل إلى ضرورة الحالة الجمعية بين الناس والتكاتف فيما بينها، وإثارة كل هذه الأسئلة. في المشهد السابق، **هناك متطوعون، وشهدنا مئات وعشرات الشهداء الذين لا نعرف الآن من هي المؤسسات أو الجهات التي ستعنى بهم أو بعوائلهم أو بأبنائهم**. مرحلة الاستقرار في سوريا اليوم تختلف. إذا كنت مواطناً صحفياً، يجب أن تسأل أولاً: ما هي حقوقي لدى المؤسسة التي أتعامل معها أو التي أتطوع لأجلها؟ هذا أبسط الأسئلة. لم يعد المشهد كما في السابق، حيث كنا نعتمد على العفوية أو النخوة. الآن، انتقلنا إلى مرحلة المأسسة. المأسسة تختلف، لأنك تتعامل مع مؤسسة، وأولى الأشياء التي يجب أن تُطرح هي: ما هي حقوقي؟ ما هي واجباتي؟ ماذا عليّ؟ وماذا لكم؟ هذه الأسئلة تريح الطرفين وتساعد على بناء علاقة مستقرة وطويلة الأمد.

**من وجهة نظري، يفترض أن يتعاون الجميع في هذه المرحلة. هذه واحدة من التحديات، وربما أهمها.**

قصف إسرائيلي على أهداف سورية - صورة أرشيقية من موقع المرصد السوري

أعلنت وزارة الدفاع السورية تفاصيل العدوان الجوي الذي شنته قوات الاحتلال، اليوم السبت، على العاصمة دمشق.

وقالت وزارة الدفاع السورية، في ما نشرته على لسان مصدر عسكري عبر صفحتها الرسمية على موقع فيسبوك، أنه في «حوالي الساعة 1:35 من فجر اليوم السبت، نفذ العدو الإسرائيلي عدوانا جويا من اتجاه الجولان السوري المحتل مستهدفا بعض النقاط في محيط مدينة دمشق».

وأضاف المصدر: «تصدت وسائط دفاعنا الجوي لصواريخ العدوان وأسقطت معظمها، واقتصرت الخسائر على الماديات».

بيان وزارة الدفاع السورية

وفي وقت سابق، اليوم السبت، ذكرت وسائل الإعلام الرسمية السورية أن إسرائيل شنت هجوما جويا على محيط العاصمة السورية دمشق.

كما أفادت وسائل الإعلام السورية بسماع دوي انفجارات متتالية في دمشق.

وذكر موقع روسيا اليوم أن الدفاعات الجوية السورية نجحت في التصدى لأهداف معادية في أجواء محيط العاصمة دمشق، موضحا أن الانفجارات القوية بدأت في الساعة 01:35 بتوقيت دمشق، مشيرا إلى أنها استمرت دقائق عدة.

#### **غزة تواجه الإبادة**

ولليوم الـ57، يواصل الاحتلال عدوانه على قطاع غزة الذي بدأ في السابع من أكتوبر/ تشرين الأول، بعد قيام المقاومة الفلسطينية بتنفيذ عملية طوفان الأقصى، بمنطقة غلاف غزة، وبعد انتهاء الهدنة الإنسانية المؤقتة في القطاع، صباح يوم الجمعة، وهو اليوم الـ56 للعدوان.

وتتواصل الغارات التي تشنها مقاتلات الاحتلال، مما أدى إلى ارتقاء آلاف الشهداء والجرحى.

وأعلن المكتب الإعلامي الحكومي في غزة، أمس الجمعة، ارتفاع عدد الشهداء إلى 15 ألفا و110 فلسطينيين، بينهم 6150 طفلا و4000 سيدة.

وذكر المكتب الحكومي، في بيان، أن عدد شهداء الكوادر الطبية بلغ نحو 207 أطباء وممرضين ومسعفين، كما استشهد 73 صحفيا.

وزاد إجمالي عدد الإصابات عن 37 ألف حالة، أكثر من 75% منهم من الأطفال والنساء.

وأوضح أن إجمالي عدد البلاغات عن المفقودين تحت الأنقاض بلغ 6500 بلاغ، فيما بلغ إجمالي عدد الوحدات السكنية التي تضررت كليا أو جزئيا 300 ألف وحدة، إلى جانب استهداف 266 مدرسة، وخروج 26 مستشفى من الخدمة فضلا عن تدمير 56 سيارة إسعاف.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the Iron Dome system was active during the October 1, 2024, attack on Israel. Images from Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) and Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) show the system in action. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the interception rate of the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. The percentage of intercepted missiles is not mentioned in any of the provided sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) has an image of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles over Israel <image:8157>. Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) published an article on October 2, 2024, about the Iron Dome, including an image of the system in action <image:8158>.

The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3)) provides an image of Israeli air defenses, including the Iron Dome, which is designed to intercept short-range missiles <image:8159>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Iron Dome system was active during the October 1, 2024, attack on Israel. Images from Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) and Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) show the system in action. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the interception rate of the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. The percentage of intercepted missiles is not mentioned in any of the provided sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence, similar to the previous one, shows the Iron Dome in action during the Iranian attack. However, it still does not provide any information about the interception rate.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of data on the Iron Dome's success rate during the specified event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) has an image of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles over Israel <image:8157>. Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) published an article on October 2, 2024, about the Iron Dome, including an image of the system in action <image:8158>.

The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3)) provides an image of Israeli air defenses, including the Iron Dome, which is designed to intercept short-range missiles <image:8159>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the Iron Dome system was active during the October 1, 2024, attack on Israel. Images from Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/pictures/latest-photos-missiles-rain-down-israel-2024-10-01/AIRIZRLERFN2FMZKBADVKDEC24/)) and Euronews ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/10/02/the-iron-dome-how-does-israels-missile-defence-system-work)) show the system in action. However, the provided evidence does not contain any information about the interception rate of the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available evidence. The percentage of intercepted missiles is not mentioned in any of the provided sources.

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.

    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, but it does not confirm the claim that it is a result of Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search results show that there were Israeli airstrikes that caused fires. However, there is no information to verify the claim's specific details.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The articles can be found at: [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/27/first-thing-deadly-israeli-airstrike-on-refugee-tents-in-rafa-leaves-aid-groups-horrified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/27/first-thing-deadly-israeli-airstrike-on-refugee-tents-in-rafa-leaves-aid-groups-horrified), [https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/israeli-strike-hospital-tent-00183579](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/israeli-strike-hospital-tent-00183579), and [https://www.npr.org/2025/06/15/nx-s1-5434172/israel-iran-strikes](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/15/nx-s1-5434172/israel-iran-strikes).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts a fire, but it does not confirm the claim that it is a result of Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The image search results show that there were Israeli airstrikes that caused fires. However, there is no information to verify the claim's specific details.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. It was taken in 2019 and featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The image is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster.

The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" by Robert Lindsay. An article in _Times of Israel_ from October 21, 2024, discusses a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, but does not include the image.


### Evidence from `image_search`
Haaretz published an article about the detailed plans of Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence (<image:8222>). Siasat.com discusses a report about a Hezbollah drone filming Netanyahu's residence (<image:8223>). The Aviationist reports on an alleged drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house (<image:8224>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image (<image:53>) is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, Israel, and was taken in 2019. The claim states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. This is inconsistent with the evidence, which indicates the image's origin predates the claimed event.

The evidence also mentions a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in October 2024, but this event is not directly linked to the image in question. Additionally, the image search results show other images related to Netanyahu's residences, including one that may have been taken by a drone.

Therefore, the claim is false because the image was taken in 2019, not in August 2024.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp. Al Jazeera reports that Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp. Al Jazeera reports that Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Le Monde reports on the assassination of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh (<image:7377>). The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp (<image:7378>). An NBC News article discusses the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh (<image:7379>).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The PBS article ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/killing-of-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-by-alleged-israeli-strike-threatens-escalation)) and the CNN article ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) both contain images of Ismail Haniyeh (<image:7382>, <image:7383>).

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-iran-what-to-know-whats-next)) reports that Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran (<image:7384>).


## Elaboration
The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp. Al Jazeera reports that Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. While there is evidence of Israeli military dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim appears to be digitally altered. The reverse image search did not yield any results, and the image search found other images of similar events, but not the exact one in the claim.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
