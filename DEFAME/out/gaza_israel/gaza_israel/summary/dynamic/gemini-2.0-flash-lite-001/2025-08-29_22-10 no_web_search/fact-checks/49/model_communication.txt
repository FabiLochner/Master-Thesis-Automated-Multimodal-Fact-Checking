# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met, as indicated by the image of them shaking hands and multiple news articles about their meeting on July 22, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not include any direct quotes from Kamala Harris. Therefore, I cannot verify whether she made the specific statement about supporting Israel.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a reliable source that quotes Kamala Harris saying, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Israel declares ‘state of war’ after Hamas militants launch surprise attack from Gaza (videos)

Palestinian Islamist group, Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel  on Saturday morning, October 7 in a surprise assault as several gunmen crossed into different Israeli towns while a heavy barrage of rockets are fired from the Gaza Strip.

As at press time, warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem.

At least 40 people have been killed since Hamas launched the surprise attack on Israel, the country’s emergency service said.

Another 779 people have been wounded, according to the Israeli Health Ministry.

  
Israel’s military said it was on a war footing and the defense minister said the Iran-backed Hamas had made a “grave mistake” by declaring war on Israel, in retaliation, Israeli military launched air strikes into Gaza.

  
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said Hamas had “launched a war against the State of Israel”. Israeli “troops are fighting against the enemy at every location”, he said.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313160-1696661234669-gettyimages-1711150149-20090101231007-911-002189_1696674381.jpeg)

  
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.

> “A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.

The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades.

Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel’s police chief said there were “21 active scenes” in southern Israel.

  
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of war ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.

  
Hamas military commander, Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.

![Israel declares ](https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/107313161-1696664544161-gettyimages-1711245488-AFP_33XP63Y_1696674371.jpeg)

  
“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.

Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from a Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said militants had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.

>   
> “They just came in again, please send help,” she said. “There are a lot of homes harmed … My husband is holding the door closed … They are firing rounds of bullets.”

Palestinian media reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.

  
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in  a speech this morning said the country was in war. His office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours.

  
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.

  
“We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,” said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.

  
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

After massive rocket fire in Southern Israel, Armed Palestinians were reportedly seen on the streets of Israel<br><br>  <br>Source: _MuhammadSafZal_  <br>  <br><br>> Palestinian fighters have infiltrated areas of southern Israel as a barrage of rockets launched from the Gaza Strip killed at least one woman and injured 15 others, according to Israeli medical workers.  <br>>   <br>> The rocket fire began from multiple locations in Gaza starting at 06:30 am local time (03:30 GMT) on Saturday and continued for nearly half an hour, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported.  <br>>   <br>> Mohammad Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, announced the start of a military operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.  <br>>   <br>> Deif said the rockets fired marked the start of “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm”, according to reports. “We’ve decided to say enough is enough,” Deif said as he urged all Palestinians to confront Israel.  <br>>   <br>> “This is the day of the greatest battle \[to\] end the last occupation,” he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.  <br>>   <br>> Israel’s military told Israelis living around the Gaza Strip to stay in their homes and warned that Hamas “will pay heavy price for its actions”.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli media reported that armed fighters had opened fire on passersby in the town of Sderot, in southern Israel, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show clashes in city streets.  <br>>   <br>> Videos posted on social media showed what appeared to be uniformed Palestinian fighters inside the Israeli border town of Sderot. Another video appeared to a crowd of Palestinian men dancing around and on top of a burning Israeli tank. The authenticity of the videos could not immediately be verified.  <br>>   <br>> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was to meet with his top security officials on Saturday morning.  <br>>   <br>> Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the “element of surprise” in the early morning attack which appeared to involve Palestinian fighters in trucks inside Israel and on paragliders, in addition to the rocket fire, will leave Israelis “shocked and stunned”.<br><br>  <br>[SOURCE](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports)<br><br>**10 Likes** **3 Shares**<br><br>([Share⤴](#)<br>)<br><br>*   ![](/static/copypost.svg/3)Copy Post<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/whatsapp.svg/3)WhatsApp<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/telegram.svg/3)Telegram<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/twitter.svg/3)Twitter<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   ![](/static/facebook.svg/3)Facebook<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740638_img20231007063148_jpeg0756aad4954d77978ecd178fbbf6930c)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740639_screenmaster20231007063416_jpeg8a2723256f4e323049af97dfa8770b6f)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740640_img20231007064058_jpeg7dcde991e6026c7a8397b6e3a5f2cf93)<br><br>![](https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/17740641_img20231007064203_jpeg6ab49057eb636386ec9a67b195b39b00) |

| I want to believe no terrorist will moan when the mighty hand of Israel hit them hard. I've always said it, these religious lot are nothing but a bunch of barbarians. Give 'em an inch and they'll sink your country like the Titanic. Just look at what's been going on up north in Nigeria. The whole point of their religion seems to be causing trouble and chaos, so it's no surprise that their followers are just as bad.  <br>  <br>They're a bunch of hypocrites, aren't they? They blow things up, run and hide, then come out crying when the Israelis strike back. They use civilians as human shields, the bloody cowards! It's like they have no shame. All they know how to do is make trouble, then play the victim when things go south. They're a bunch of chancers, the lot of them. Bloody cowards!  <br>  <br>I 'ope these ruddy terrorists know that the Israelis don't muck about when it comes to lookin' out for their own. If any of their Yank cousins got caught up in it, it'd be a right proper problem for them. I think they've forgotten about what happened in Munich, and the consequences after that. This could be right nasty, if you get my drift.

    **আল-কাসসামের সফল অপারেশন: খান ইউনিসে ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের দুটি ট্যাংক ধ্বংস**
    
    ! <image:4221>
    
      
      
      
      
    ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা ও অত্যাচারের বিরুদ্ধে ফিলিস্তিনি মুজাহিদদের সংগ্রাম অব্যাহত রয়েছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস তাদের সর্বশেষ অপারেশনে ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক ধ্বংস করেছে। খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় সংঘটিত এই অপারেশনে ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও সাইড আইইডি ব্যবহার করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীদের উপর কঠোর প্রতিশোধ নেওয়া হয়েছে।  
      
    আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডস ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবার এক বিবৃতিতে জানিয়েছে যে তাদের যোদ্ধারা কেন্দ্রীয় খান ইউনিসের আবু হামিদ এলাকায় ইহুদিবাদী দখলদার বাহিনীর দুটি মেরকাভা ট্যাংক লক্ষ্য করে দুটি ইয়াসিন-১০৫ শেল ও একটি সাইড আইইডি’র বিস্ফোরণ ঘটিয়ে সেগুলো সফলভাবে ধ্বংস করেছে। এই অপারেশনটি গাজা উপত্যকায় ইসরায়েলের অব্যাহত গণহত্যা, ধ্বংসযজ্ঞ ও মানবতাবিরোধী অপরাধের জবাব হিসেবে পরিচালিত হয়েছে।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনী ২০২৩ সাল থেকে গাজায় নৃশংস হামলা চালাচ্ছে। আন্তর্জাতিক আদালতের রায় উপেক্ষা করে ইহুদিবাদী সন্ত্রাসীরা গাজায় অবরোধ দিয়ে, খাদ্য ও ওষুধের সংকট সৃষ্টি করে মানবিক বিপর্যয় ডেকে এনেছে। এমনকি বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা (WHO) ও জাতিসংঘ বারবার সতর্ক করেও ইসরায়েলের নৃশংসতা বন্ধ করতে পারেনি।  
      
    এই পরিস্থিতিতে আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের মতো ফিলিস্তিনি প্রতিরোধ গ্রুপগুলোর অপারেশন ইহুদিবাদী দখলদারদের জন্য ক্রমাগত চ্যালেঞ্জ হয়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে। গত জুলাই মাসেও আল-কাসসাম ও আল-কুদস ব্রিগেডস যৌথভাবে ইসরায়েলি সেনাদের ওপর মর্টার হামলা চালিয়ে যানবাহন ধ্বংস করেছিল।  
      
    ইসরায়েলি দখলদার বাহিনীর নৃশংসতা যতই বাড়ছে, ফিলিস্তিনি জনগণের প্রতিরোধের চেতনা ততই শাণিত হচ্ছে। আল-কাসসাম ব্রিগেডসের ১৪ আগস্ট, বৃহস্পতিবারের সফল অপারেশন প্রমাণ করে যে, অন্যায়ের বিরুদ্ধে সংগ্রাম কখনই থামানো যায় না। ইসরায়েলের অভ্যন্তরে বেড়ে চলেছে হতাশা নেতৃত্বহীনতার অভিযোগ। যুদ্ধের সময় যত গড়াচ্ছে, ততই স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে—যারা একদিন দখল নিতে এসেছিল, তারা আজ নিজেরাই দিশেহারা।

    **কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে যুগান্তকারী বাণিজ্য সহযোগিতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া**
    
    ! <image:4223>
    
      
      
    দ্বিপক্ষীয় অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করতে কিরগিজস্তানের সাথে একটি ব্যাপক অর্থনৈতিক পদক্ষেপ হাতে নিয়েছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তান। এই উদ্দেশ্যে একটি বিস্তারিত রোডম্যাপ প্রণয়ন ও সমঝোতা চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর করেছে উভয় পক্ষ। সম্প্রতি ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শিল্প ও বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রী নূরুদ্দিন আজিজি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ’র কিরগিজস্তান সফরকালে এই চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এই সময় বাণিজ্য সম্পর্ক সম্প্রসারণ ও ব্যবসায় বাধা অপসারণ করতে কিরগিজ প্রতিনিধিদের সাথে ব্যাপক আলোচনা উপস্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এছাড়া যৌথ বাণিজ্য কাউন্সিল গঠন, নিয়মিত বৈঠক আয়োজন এবং অগ্রগতি পর্যবেক্ষণের জন্য একটি যৌথ ওয়ার্কিং গ্রুপ গঠনের বিষয়ে উক্ত সভায় আলোচনা হয়েছে।  
      
    ট্রেড হাউস ও বাণিজ্যিক কেন্দ্র চালু করা, অর্থনৈতিক ফোরাম, প্রদর্শনী এবং আফগানিস্তানে যৌথ বিনিয়োগ সম্প্রসারণের পরিকল্পনা উত্থাপিত হয়েছে।  
      
    দ্বিপাক্ষিক ট্রানজিট করিডোর, বাণিজ্য ও ট্রানজিট উন্নয়ন চুক্তি স্বাক্ষর এবং উজবেকিস্তান ও তাজিকিস্তানকে জড়িত করে ত্রিপক্ষীয় সহযোগিতায় কাজ করতে উভয়ে সম্মত হয়েছে।  
      
    নতুন এই চুক্তিতে কিরগিজ প্রশাসনের পক্ষ থেকে আফগান ব্যবসায়ীদের বাণিজ্যিক ভিসা, ব্যাংকিং সংযোগ ও পরিবহন রুট সহজতর করার প্রতিশ্রুতি রয়েছে।  
      
    আফগানিস্তান দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, মধ্য এশিয়া এবং মধ্য প্রাচ্যকে সংযোগকারী ট্রানজিট হাব হয়ে উঠার প্রবল সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তাই কৌশলগত অবস্থানকে কাজে লাগিয়ে মধ্য এশিয়ার রাষ্ট্রগুলোতে বাণিজ্য সম্প্রসারণ করছে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া।  
      
    উক্ত সমঝোতা স্মারক দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কের ক্ষেত্রে একটি উল্লেখযোগ্য মাইলফলক হিসেবে অভিহিত করেছেন উভয় পক্ষ। এর মাধ্যমে উভয় দেশের মধ্যে ব্যবসা বৃদ্ধি ও অর্থনৈতিক সংহতির পথ প্রশস্ত হবে বলে প্রত্যাশা করা হচ্ছে।

    **আমেরিকার প্রচারিত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে রাজনৈতিক সুর বিদ্যমান: জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ**
    
    ! <image:4228>
    
      
      
    ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া আফগানিস্তানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সরাসরি উপস্থিতি নেই, তারা আফগানিস্তান সম্পর্কে প্রত্যক্ষ জ্ঞানও রাখে না, তা সত্ত্বেও মানবাধিকার ইস্যুতে নিজেদের ইচ্ছে মতো মূল্যায়ন প্রকাশ করে যাচ্ছে ওয়াশিংটন। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্র দপ্তরের মানবাধিকার বিষয়ক বার্ষিক প্রতিবেদনের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় এসব মন্তব্য করেন ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার মুখপাত্র জাবিহুল্লাহ মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ।  
      
    উক্ত মানবাধিকার প্রতিবেদনে দাবি করা হয়, তালিবান সরকারের অধীনে আফগানিস্তানে মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষা উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে হ্রাস পেয়েছে। নারী অধিকার ও মত প্রকাশের স্বাধীনতা লঙ্ঘিত হয়েছে।  
      
    জবাবে মুজাহিদ হাফিযাহুল্লাহ বলেন, আফগানিস্তানে কোনও মার্কিন দূতাবাস নেই। তাই তাদের পক্ষে আফগানিস্তানের বাস্তবতা, অগ্রগতি বা মানবাধিকারের বিষয়গুলো পর্যবেক্ষণ করা চলে না। এই প্রতিবেদনগুলোর সাথে রাজনৈতিক উদ্দেশ্য জড়িত, অধিকাংশ প্রতিবেদন ষড়যন্ত্রের হাতিয়ার হিসেবে প্রকাশ করা হয়ে থাকে।  
      
    তিনি জোর দিয়ে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচিত মার্কিন দখলদারিত্বের সময়ের সাথে আফগানিস্তানের বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি তুলনা করা, মানবাধিকার সুরক্ষার ক্ষেত্রে কোন সময়কালটি অধিক উত্তম সেটা তারা অনুধাবন করুক।  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, আফগান ইস্যু নিয়ে আমেরিকার উদ্বিগ্ন হওয়া উচিত নয়, কেননা নাগরিকদের অধিকার সম্পর্কে বর্তমান সরকার অবগত আছে। আফগানিস্তানের একটি একটি ধর্মীয় ও আইনি দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি রয়েছে, নাগরিকদের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করতে এখানে ধর্মীয় বাধ্যবাধকতা রয়েছে।

    **ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার চার বছরের অর্জন: সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক দু’ক্ষেত্রেই বিজয়**
    
    ! <image:4231>
    
      
      
      
    আফগানিস্তানে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার শাসন পুনঃপ্রতিষ্ঠার চার বছর পূর্ণ হতে চলেছে। এ উপলক্ষে ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার কর্মকর্তারা সামরিক ও রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রে নিজেদের অর্জনের ওপর আলোকপাত করেছেন।  
      
    গত ১৩ আগস্ট কাতারে অবস্থিত ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার দূতাবাসের ভারপ্রাপ্ত প্রধান সুহাইল শাহিন হাফিযাহুল্লাহ জানান, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার বিজয় অর্জনের ফলে শত্রুদের রাজনৈতিক ও কৌশলগত পরিকল্পনা ব্যর্থ হয়েছে এবং দেশের প্রশাসনিক কাঠামো আরও মজবুত হয়েছে।  
      
    তিনি বলেন, ‘এই বিজয়ের গুরুত্বপূর্ণ দিক হলো ইমারতে ইসলামিয়া শুধু সামরিক নয়, রাজনৈতিক ক্ষেত্রেও সফলতা অর্জন করেছে। এই উদ্যোগ আফগানিস্তানে ইসলামি শাসন প্রতিষ্ঠার পথকে সুগম করেছে।’  
      
    তিনি আরও বলেন, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার সদস্যদের প্রচেষ্টা ও আফগান জনগণের ত্যাগের কারণে বিশ্ব শক্তি ও তাদের মিত্ররা পরাজিত হয়েছে।  
      
    এর আগে, ইমারতে ইসলামিয়ার জ্যেষ্ঠ নেতা আনাস হাক্কানি হাফিযাহুল্লাহ দোহা চুক্তিকে আফগানিস্তানে আমেরিকার পরাজয়ের লিখিত স্বীকৃতি হিসেবে বর্ণনা করেন। তিনি বলেন, চুক্তির মাধ্যমে আমেরিকা ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তর করতে বাধ্য হয়েছিল, যদিও শুরুতে তারা আলোচনা এড়িয়ে গিয়েছিল। হাক্কানি জানান, তালিবান পারস্পরিক সমঝোতার মাধ্যমে ক্ষমতায় আসতে চাইলেও সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আশরাফ ঘানির হঠাৎ পলায়ন সেই পরিকল্পনায় পরিবর্তন আনে।

* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

### Evidence from `image_search`
Reuters published an article on October 18, 2024, about Israel sending more troops into northern Gaza, including an image of the destruction in Gaza (<image:7683>). Le Monde published an article on October 27, 2024, about the Jabalia refugee camp, including an image of the camp (<image:7684>). The Los Angeles Times published an article on October 31, 2023, about an Israeli strike on a Gaza refugee camp (<image:7685>).

The articles can be found at the following URLs: [https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sends-more-troops-into-north-gaza-deepens-raid-2024-10-18/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sends-more-troops-into-north-gaza-deepens-raid-2024-10-18/), [https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/27/in-gaza-survivors-flee-from-jabalia-refugee-camp_6730618_4.html](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/10/27/in-gaza-survivors-flee-from-jabalia-refugee-camp_6730618_4.html), and [https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-31/israel-says-strike-on-gaza-refugee-camp-kills-hamas-commander-but-civilians-die-as-well](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-31/israel-says-strike-on-gaza-refugee-camp-kills-hamas-commander-but-civilians-die-as-well).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there was fighting in Gaza in October 2024, and that Jabalia camp was a location of conflict. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the details of the claim, such as the destruction of the tank by Hamas fighters. The image search results do not provide any information about the image in the claim.

More information is needed to verify the claim.

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published a report on October 16, 2024, discussing emerging trends in chemical weapons usage in the Middle East. The report, authored by Natasha Hall, analyzes the growing willingness of states to develop and deploy chemical weapons. The report includes an image of a girl holding an oxygen mask over the face of an infant following a reported gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus, Syria, on January 22, 2018. <image:5763> The report also includes an image of three men wearing gas masks. <image:5761> The report's findings suggest that the taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013.

Content: "Tillerson: Russia 'ultimately bears responsibility' for chemical attacks in Syria
=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

U.S. ambassador to the [United Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
 [Nikki Haley](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/nikki-haley.htm)
 joined Tillerson in his condemnation of Russia, releasing a paper statement that said, "This attack in Syria should weigh heavily" on Russia's "conscience."

The U.S. "will pursue all available avenues for accountability," according to Haley's office, including through the U.N. Security Council, the [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/chemical-weapons-convention.htm)
 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
