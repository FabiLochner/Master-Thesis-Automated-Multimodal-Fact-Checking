The claim '<image:7> This is an authentic image of Benjamin Netanyahu being hospitalized in Tel Aviv in November 2024 due to a serious health issue.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is likely fake, as indicated by a Forbes article ([Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/11/08/viral-photo-of-benjamin-netanyahu-hospitalized-is-actually-fake/)). The claim also mentions a hospitalization in November 2024, which does not align with the available information about Netanyahu's hospitalizations, including reports of a hospitalization in July 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
