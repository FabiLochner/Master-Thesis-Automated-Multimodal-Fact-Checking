## Final Judgement

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The available evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu had a phone call and that both Trump and Kamala Harris were involved in the 2024 election, but it does not provide any information about the content of the call. Therefore, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal to hurt Harris's campaign cannot be verified.
