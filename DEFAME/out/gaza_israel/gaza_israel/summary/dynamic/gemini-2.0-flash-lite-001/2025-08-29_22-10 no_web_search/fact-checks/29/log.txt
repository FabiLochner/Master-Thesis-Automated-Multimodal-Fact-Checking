The claim 'The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the World Jewish Congress amended the IHRA working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include "Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel" is not supported by the provided evidence. While the WJC is involved with the IHRA definition, and the definition itself exists, no evidence was found to support the specific amendment mentioned in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
