The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image search and reverse image search did not yield any results to support the claim of a US facility attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. The evidence includes images of attacks in Baghdad, but none match the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
