## Final Judgement
The image shows a man in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE
