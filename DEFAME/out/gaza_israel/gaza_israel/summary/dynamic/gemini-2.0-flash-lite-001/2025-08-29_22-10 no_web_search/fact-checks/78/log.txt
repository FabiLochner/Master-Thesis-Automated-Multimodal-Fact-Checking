The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While evidence confirms an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu's presence in Israel during that time, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he left Israel and fled to Poland.

So, the overall veracity is: false
