## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Politico.eu published an article about a Hezbollah rocket attack, including an image of the aftermath. [https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/) (![image 8201](media/2025-08-29_22-24-1756506279-324201.jpg)) Axios reports that Hezbollah launched medium-range rockets into Israel in September 2024. [https://www.axios.com/2024/09/21/hezbollah-launches-medium-range-rockets-israel](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/21/hezbollah-launches-medium-range-rockets-israel) (![image 8202](media/2025-08-29_22-24-1756506280-200790.jpg)) The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats published a map showing attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024, indicating a three-wave rocket attack by Lebanese Hezbollah targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. [https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-22-2024) (![image 8203](media/2025-08-29_22-24-1756506281-352957.jpg))


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched a rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024. However, the provided images of the aftermath of the attack do not match the image in the claim. The image in the claim shows a burning aircraft, while the other images show damage to buildings and vehicles.

The claim is therefore not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Hezbollah launched a rocket attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024. However, the image provided in the claim does not match the images of the aftermath of the attack. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there was a Hezbollah rocket attack on an IDF airbase near Haifa on September 22, 2024, the image provided in the claim does not depict the aftermath of that attack. The evidence includes reports of the attack and images of the damage, which do not match the image in the claim.
