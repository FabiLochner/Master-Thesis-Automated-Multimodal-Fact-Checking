The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified because the search results confirm Israeli airstrikes in Gaza City, including the Shejaeya neighborhood, in April 2025, but do not mention Sham Imad Muhareb or provide details about a baby injured in an airstrike.

So, the overall veracity is: false
