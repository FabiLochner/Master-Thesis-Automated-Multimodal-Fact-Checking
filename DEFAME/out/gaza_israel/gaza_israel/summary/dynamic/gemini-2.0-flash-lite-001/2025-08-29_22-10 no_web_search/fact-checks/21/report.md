Reuters also has an image of Trump signing an executive order (![image 7483](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504485-624774.jpg)). The New York Times published an article with an image of Trump holding an executive order (![image 7484](media/2025-08-29_21-54-1756504486-080411.jpg)).

The articles can be found at [https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2025/feb/06/us-to-pull-from-top-un-rights-council/](https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2025/feb/06/us-to-pull-from-top-un-rights-council/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-orders-iran-withdrawing-us-un-human-rights-council-unrwa-2025-02-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-signs-orders-iran-withdrawing-us-un-human-rights-council-unrwa-2025-02-04/), and [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/trump-united-nations-unrwa.html).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Trump signed executive orders. The search results include articles from nwaonline.com, Reuters, and The New York Times. The Reuters and The New York Times articles mention Trump signing orders related to Iran, withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, and UNRWA. The nwaonline.com article also shows Trump holding an executive order.

The provided URLs indicate that the articles were published in February 2025. However, the claim states that the executive order was signed on January 20, 2025.

Based on the evidence, it is impossible to verify the exact date of the executive order. More information is needed to confirm the date.
