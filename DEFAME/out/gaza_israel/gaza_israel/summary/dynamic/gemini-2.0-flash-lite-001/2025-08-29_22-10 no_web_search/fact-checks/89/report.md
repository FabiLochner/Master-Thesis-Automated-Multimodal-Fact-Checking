### Evidence from `image_search`
The PBS article ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/killing-of-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-by-alleged-israeli-strike-threatens-escalation)) and the CNN article ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) both contain images of Ismail Haniyeh (![image 7382](media/2025-08-29_21-24-1756502650-488654.jpg), ![image 7383](media/2025-08-29_21-24-1756502650-879892.jpg)).

Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/hamas-chief-ismail-haniyeh-killed-in-iran-what-to-know-whats-next)) reports that Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran (![image 7384](media/2025-08-29_21-24-1756502651-341158.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The Tehran Times reports that Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp. Al Jazeera reports that Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence used WhatsApp to track Haniyeh.
