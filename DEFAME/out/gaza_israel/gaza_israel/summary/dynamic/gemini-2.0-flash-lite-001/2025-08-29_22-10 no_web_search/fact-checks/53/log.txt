The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump and he was active on Truth Social, there is no evidence of a post on July 25, 2024, containing the specific quote. The search results show Trump was at a conference and involved in events related to Israel around that time, but no post with the mentioned quote was found.

So, the overall veracity is: false
