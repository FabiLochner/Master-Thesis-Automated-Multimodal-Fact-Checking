The claim 'Netanyahu’s son Yair was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024 that targeted the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea, Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in a drone attack on October 19, 2024, cannot be verified. While multiple sources, including the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/19/world/middleeast/drone-netanyahu-israel-caesarea.html) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/19/drone-hits-netanyahus-home-as-hezbollah-rockets-target-northern-israel), reported a drone attack on that date in Caesarea targeting Netanyahu's home, none of the evidence mentions Yair Netanyahu's death.

So, the overall veracity is: false
