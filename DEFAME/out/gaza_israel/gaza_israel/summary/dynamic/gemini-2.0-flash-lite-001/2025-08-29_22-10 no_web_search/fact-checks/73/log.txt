Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/8/israel-seizes-buffer-zone-in-syrias-golan-heights-after-al-assad-falls): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights. The article includes an image of an Israeli tank. <image:8178>

The claim '<image:45> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is likely false. While the image of Israeli tanks appears in articles related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and near Damascus, a search result from NDTV.com ([https://www.ndtv.com/](https://www.ndtv.com/)) explicitly labels a similar image as "FALSE" and dates it to December 10, 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
