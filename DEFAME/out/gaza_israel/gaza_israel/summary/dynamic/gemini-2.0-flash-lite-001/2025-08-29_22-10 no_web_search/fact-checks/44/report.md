## Claim
Claim: "![image 28](media/44.jpg) This image authentically shows U.S. President Joe Boden in late November 2024 exiting a Nantucket bookstore holding a copy of writer Rashid Khalidi's book, 'The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917â€“2017.'"

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 28](media/44.jpg))
image_search("Joe Biden Nantucket Bookworks")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The National Herald published an image of Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks. (![image 7998](media/2025-08-29_22-17-1756505836-350384.jpg)) Forbes published an image of Joe Biden at Nantucket Bookworks. (![image 7999](media/2025-08-29_22-17-1756505837-033346.jpg)) The Forbes article was published on November 22, 2023.

The American Israelite did not provide any content.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Joe Biden visited Nantucket Bookworks. The Forbes article, published on November 22, 2023, places the visit in late November 2023. The claim states the visit occurred in late November 2024, which is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not mention the book Biden was holding.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The image search confirms that Joe Biden visited Nantucket Bookworks in late November 2023, not 2024 as the claim states. The evidence does not mention the book Biden was holding.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Joe Biden did visit Nantucket Bookworks, the visit occurred in late November 2023, according to a Forbes article, not in late November 2024 as the claim states. The evidence does not mention the book Biden was holding.
