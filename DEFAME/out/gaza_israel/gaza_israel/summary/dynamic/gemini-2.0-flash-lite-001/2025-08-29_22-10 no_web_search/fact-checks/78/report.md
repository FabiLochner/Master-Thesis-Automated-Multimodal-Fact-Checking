## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially in Poland or planning to go to Poland around January 2025, as indicated by the Los Angeles Times and Reuters articles. These articles discuss the Polish president's interest in Netanyahu's attendance at an Auschwitz anniversary event. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an article with an image of Netanyahu ![image 8198](media/2025-08-29_22-24-1756506269-407650.jpg) regarding an Iranian missile attack. CNN published an article on October 23, 2024, about Netanyahu ![image 8200](media/2025-08-29_22-24-1756506270-431346.jpg).

## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms that an Iranian missile attack on Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, as the Institute for the Study of War, The Guardian, and The Times of Israel reported. The Times of Israel also published an article with an image of Netanyahu regarding the attack. However, the evidence does not state that Netanyahu left Israel or fled to Poland.

Therefore, the claim is still not verified. While the evidence confirms the missile attack and Netanyahu's presence in Israel, it does not support the claim that he fled to Poland.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Netanyahu was present in Israel during that time. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While evidence confirms an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu's presence in Israel during that time, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he left Israel and fled to Poland.
