Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/shortly-after-strike-pms-office-releases-photo-of-netanyahu-at-military-hq/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office. <image:7796>

The claim '<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is an altered version of a photo taken in 2009, as reported by [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/altered-this-photo-of-a-drone-surveilling-pm-netanyahu-is-fabricated-396f43e817da). The original photo shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father, and the claim misrepresents the context of the image.

So, the overall veracity is: false
