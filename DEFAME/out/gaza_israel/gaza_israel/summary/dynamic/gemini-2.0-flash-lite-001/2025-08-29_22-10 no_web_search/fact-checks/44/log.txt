Useful result: From [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2023/11/22/bidens-thanksgiving-tradition-includes-dinner-at-this-billionaires-nantucket-estate/): 
Content: Forbes published an image of Joe Biden at Nantucket Bookworks. <image:7999> The article was published on November 22, 2023.

The claim '<image:28> This image authentically shows U.S. President Joe Boden in late November 2024 exiting a Nantucket bookstore holding a copy of writer Rashid Khalidi's book, 'The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Joe Biden did visit Nantucket Bookworks, the visit occurred in late November 2023, according to a Forbes article, not in late November 2024 as the claim states. The evidence does not mention the book Biden was holding.

So, the overall veracity is: false
