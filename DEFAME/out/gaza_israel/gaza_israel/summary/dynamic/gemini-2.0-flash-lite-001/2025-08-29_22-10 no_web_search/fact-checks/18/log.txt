Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gal-gadot-receives-star-on-hollywood-walk-of-fame/): 
Content: The Times of Israel shows an image of Gal Gadot at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, sitting next to her star <image:7910>.

The claim '<image:15> This image shows Gal Gadot’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame being destroyed in March 2025 just hours after being placed.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim accurately depicts the vandalized star of Gal Gadot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gal-gadots-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star-smashed-amid-pro-palestinian-protests-photo-is-viral-7966341) and [Fox 11 Los Angeles](https://www.foxla.com/video/1649649). However, the claim's assertion that the vandalism occurred in March 2025, just hours after the star was placed, cannot be verified with the available evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
