Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israelis-flock-to-airport-for-passover-vacations-passenger-numbers-down-as-flights-canceled-after-iran-attack/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article about Israelis flocking to the airport for Passover vacations. The article includes an image of a crowded airport. <image:8267>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ynetnews.com/travel/article/s1lzrclogx): 
Content: The search result from Ynetnews.com shows an image of a crowded airport with people waiting in line. <image:8268>

The claim '<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The provided evidence does not contain any information to support the claim that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While image searches revealed crowded airport scenes in Israel, there is no connection to the specific event described in the claim. Therefore, the claim is unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
