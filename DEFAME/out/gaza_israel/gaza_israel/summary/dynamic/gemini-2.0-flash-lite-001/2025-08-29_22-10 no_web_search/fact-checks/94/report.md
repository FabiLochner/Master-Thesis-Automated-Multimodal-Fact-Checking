```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images of children receiving medical attention in Gaza. One image is from euromedmonitor.org (![image 8249](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506470-134001.jpg)), another is from an Associated Press article (![image 8250](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506472-048363.jpg)), and a photo gallery from Al Jazeera (![image 8254](media/2025-08-29_22-27-1756506472-983050.jpg)) also features children.


## Elaboration
The image search results show children in Gaza receiving medical attention, including oxygen masks. However, none of the images match the original claim's description. The evidence does not verify the claim. More information is needed to verify the claim.
