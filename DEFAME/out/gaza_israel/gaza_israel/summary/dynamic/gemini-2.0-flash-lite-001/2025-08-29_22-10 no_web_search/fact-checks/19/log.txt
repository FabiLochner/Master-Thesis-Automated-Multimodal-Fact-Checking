Content: The search result contains an image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Elon Musk. The image is labeled as "Likely Generated". <image:7901>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/world/middleeast/netanyahu-musk-meeting.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article in 2023 about a meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Elon Musk. <image:7903>

The claim '<image:16> This is an authentic image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu and Elon Musk during Netanyahu's official visit to the U.S. in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image is likely AI-generated, as indicated by the image search results, and therefore not authentic. The search also revealed a meeting between Netanyahu and Musk in 2023, but not with Trump, and the date provided in the claim is incorrect.

So, the overall veracity is: false
