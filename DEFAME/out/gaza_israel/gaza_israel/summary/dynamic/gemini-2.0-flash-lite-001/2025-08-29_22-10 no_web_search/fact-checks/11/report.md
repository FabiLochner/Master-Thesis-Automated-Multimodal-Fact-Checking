## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there have been reports of Hezbollah drone attacks and related events, there is no evidence to support the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a drone attack on October 13, 2024.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check, based on searches from CNN, ABC News, NPR, The Long War Journal, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, BBC News, and The Guardian, found no evidence to support the claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024. While the sources discuss Hezbollah attacks and Herzi Halevi's activities, none confirm the assassination. Therefore, the claim is rated as false.
