The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu had a phone call and that both Trump and Kamala Harris were involved in the 2024 election, but it does not provide any information about the content of the call. Therefore, the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal to hurt Harris's campaign cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
