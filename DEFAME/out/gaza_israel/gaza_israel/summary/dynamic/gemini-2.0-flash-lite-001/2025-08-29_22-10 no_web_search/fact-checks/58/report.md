## Claim
Claim: "![image 33](media/58.jpg) This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
geolocate(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
image_search("destroyed buildings Gaza")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an article on January 18, 2025, with an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 8115](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506037-844477.jpg)). NPR also published an image of destroyed buildings in Gaza (![image 8116](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506038-438919.jpg)). Al Jazeera published aerial photos showing the scale of destruction in Gaza (![image 8117](media/2025-08-29_22-20-1756506038-939103.jpg)).

The sources are: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/a-visual-guide-to-the-destruction-of-gaza), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map), and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/1/20/aerial-photos-show-scale-of-israeli-destruction-in-gaza).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be from Palestine, as indicated by the geolocate function. The image search confirms that there was destruction in Gaza. However, the exact date and the extent of the destruction in the image cannot be verified with the provided information. The image search results show that there was destruction in Gaza, but the images are from different sources and dates.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the exact location and date of the image.
