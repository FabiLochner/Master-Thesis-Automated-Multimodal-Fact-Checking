## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met, as indicated by the image of them shaking hands and multiple news articles about their meeting on July 22, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not include any direct quotes from Kamala Harris. Therefore, I cannot verify whether she made the specific statement about supporting Israel.

To verify the claim, I would need to find a reliable source that quotes Kamala Harris saying, "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit.

## Elaboration

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met on July 22, 2024. However, the search results do not provide a direct quote from Kamala Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue." Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check confirms that Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu met on July 22, 2024, as evidenced by multiple news sources, including CNN and Al Jazeera. However, the search results do not provide a direct quote from Kamala Harris stating, "Our support for Israel will continue," making it impossible to verify the claim.
