The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While the image shows a fire, the provided evidence does not confirm that it resulted from Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. The search results reveal images of fires related to Israeli strikes, but no evidence directly supports the claim's specific details.

So, the overall veracity is: false
