The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a 7.9-magnitude earthquake did occur in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, the image provided does not depict the ruins from that event. Image searches and geolocation analysis suggest the image was likely taken in China.

So, the overall veracity is: false
