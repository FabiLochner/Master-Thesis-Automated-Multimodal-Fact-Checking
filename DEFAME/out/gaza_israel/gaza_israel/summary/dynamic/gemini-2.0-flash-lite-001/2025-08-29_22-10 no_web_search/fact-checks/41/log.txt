Content: CNN reports on a judge's ruling that allows the U.S. government to deport Mahmoud Khalil, citing his protest activity. <image:8013>

The claim 'In March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested and detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Mahmoud Khalil was arrested by ICE, evidence from OPB and CNN indicates that a judge ruled he could be deported, contradicting the claim that he was a lawful permanent resident.

So, the overall veracity is: false
