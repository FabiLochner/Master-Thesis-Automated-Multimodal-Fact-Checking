Useful result: From [Source](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/hamas-islamic-jihad-claim-responsibility-tel-aviv-explosion-what-we-know): 
Content: Al-Monitor published an article about an explosion in Tel Aviv, with Hamas and Islamic Jihad claiming responsibility. The article includes an image of the aftermath of the explosion. <image:8240>

The claim '<image:58> This image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024. While there were explosions in Tel Aviv during that time, the evidence does not support the claim that it was a Houthi attack. Instead, sources like [Al-Monitor](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/08/hamas-islamic-jihad-claim-responsibility-tel-aviv-explosion-what-we-know) report that Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for an explosion in Tel Aviv.

So, the overall veracity is: false
