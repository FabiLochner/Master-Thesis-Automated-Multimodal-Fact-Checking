The claim 'Israel experienced an earthquake on October 5, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The search results from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/6/israel-kills-26-in-strike-on-gaza-mosque-school-orders-more-evacuations](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/6/israel-kills-26-in-strike-on-gaza-mosque-school-orders-more-evacuations)) and other sources ([https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/israel-and-palestine](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/israel-and-palestine), [https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/one-year-after-hamass-october-7-terrorist-attacks-heres-how-the-region-changed/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/one-year-after-hamass-october-7-terrorist-attacks-heres-how-the-region-changed/)) do not mention an earthquake in Israel on October 5, 2024. Instead, they focus on the conflict in the region, showing images of destroyed buildings.
