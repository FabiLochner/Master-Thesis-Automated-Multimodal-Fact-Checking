## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. According to a Wikipedia article, the attack was carried out by Israel, but it does not mention WhatsApp or Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) A CSIS article discusses the assassination and its implications. ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp))

A CNN article reports that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Amnesty International discusses Israel's attempts to protect NSO Group from accountability in a lawsuit related to WhatsApp, mentioning the use of Pegasus spyware (![image 9894](media/2025-08-30_01-16-1756516615-213091.jpg)). Al Jazeera reports that WhatsApp said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions targeted 90 of its users, including journalists and members of civil society, and that Paragon was sold to a US private equity firm in 2024.

The Guardian discusses the Israeli military's use of AI to analyze intercepted communications, mentioning Unit 8200 and its development of a ChatGPT-like tool, as well as the use of surveillance data (![image 9895](media/2025-08-30_01-17-1756516620-663408.jpg), ![image 9896](media/2025-08-30_01-17-1756516621-202073.jpg)). ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance))


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel has used spyware and AI for surveillance, including the use of Pegasus spyware and a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze intercepted communications. However, the provided sources do not explicitly state that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp for the assassination on July 31, 2024. While the evidence suggests the capability and potential use of such methods, there is no direct confirmation.

The Amnesty International and Al Jazeera articles discuss the use of spyware on WhatsApp users, including journalists and civil society members, but do not mention Haniyeh. The CNN article confirms that Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, but Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm whether Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.
