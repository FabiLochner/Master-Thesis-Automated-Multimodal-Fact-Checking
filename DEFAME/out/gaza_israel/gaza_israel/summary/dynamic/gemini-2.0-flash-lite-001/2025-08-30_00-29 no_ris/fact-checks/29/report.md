The World Jewish Congress (WJC) website provides the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, which was adopted on May 26, 2016. The definition includes examples of antisemitism, but does not mention the assassination of JFK. The IHRA definition has been adopted or endorsed by numerous countries and organizations. The United Kingdom adopted the IHRA definition on December 12, 2016. The search results do not mention the World Jewish Congress or any amendments to the definition in March 2025.

The Canadian government adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism in 2019 as part of its Anti-Racism Strategy.

The IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism was adopted in 2016 and is a "working definition" which "connote[s] the possibility for change." The Nexus Document and the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism were written in response to the IHRA definition. [https://urj.org/blog/five-definitions-antisemitism]
