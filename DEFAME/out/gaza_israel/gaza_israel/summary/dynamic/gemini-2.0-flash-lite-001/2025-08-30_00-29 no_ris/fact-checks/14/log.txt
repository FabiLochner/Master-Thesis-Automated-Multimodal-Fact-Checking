Content: The Sun published an article about a toilet explosion. <image:9258>

The claim '<image:12> This image shows the aftermath of an explosion of a Hezbollah pager in Lebanon in September 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were Hezbollah pager explosions in Lebanon in September 2024, the image provided does not depict the aftermath of those explosions. The image search results show pictures of exploded toilets, but there is no evidence to link the image in the claim to the pager explosions.

So, the overall veracity is: false
