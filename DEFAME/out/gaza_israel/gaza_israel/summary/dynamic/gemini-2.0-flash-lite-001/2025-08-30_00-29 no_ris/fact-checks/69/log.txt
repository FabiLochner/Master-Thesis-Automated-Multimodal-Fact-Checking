Useful result: From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php): 
Content: The Security Council Report discusses Israeli attacks on Syrian territory, including a ground incursion into Daraa in April 2025, with operations in Tasil. The report mentions that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said their incursion was a response to fire from gunmen on Israeli troops operating in Tasil. The report also mentions that the strikes on the T4 airbase in the Homs province followed reports that Türkiye is planning to establish control of the base. The report was posted on April 9, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an Iran Update on June 4, 2025, discussing events in Syria, including rocket attacks from Tasil, Daraa Province, into the Golan Heights on June 3, 2025. <image:9760>, <image:9761>, <image:9762>. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) briefly operated in Tasil in April 2025. The update also mentions that CTP-ISW ended daily maps of Israeli ground operations in February 2025. The update also includes a map of the assessed control of terrain in Hama on June 4, 2025. <image:9761>.

The claim '<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the image's geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel, and web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, the evidence does not provide visual confirmation of the specific event described in the claim, i.e., Israeli forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The Institute for the Study of War ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025)) mentions that they ended daily maps of Israeli ground operations in February 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
