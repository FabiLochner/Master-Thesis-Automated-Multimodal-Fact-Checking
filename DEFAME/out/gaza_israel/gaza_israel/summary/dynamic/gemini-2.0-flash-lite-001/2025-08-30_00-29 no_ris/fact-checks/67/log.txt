Useful result: From [Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf): 
Content: JINSA published a report on April 23, 2025, titled "Erdogan Calls for Israel's Destruction." The report states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan prayed for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." The report also mentions that on January 15, 2025, Erdogan said Israel must end aggressive actions in Syria or "there will be negative consequences." On February 13, 2025, Erdogan asserted that Israel is dragging the Middle East "toward blood and tears again." On April 10, 2025, Foreign Minister Fidan said "we will not sit and watch" Israel’s "expansionist" actions in Syria. The report also mentions Israeli airstrikes in late March and early April targeting Syrian airbases.

Content: The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2025, reports that Turkey has severed economic and trade ties with Israel and closed its airspace to Israeli aircraft due to the war in Gaza.

Content: The Haaretz article from July 3, 2025, discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in the relationship between Syria and Israel. It mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The article does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim. While there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in early 2025, including statements by Erdogan, there is no record of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results show Erdogan made statements regarding Israel's actions in Syria in January and February 2025, and on March 30, 2025, he prayed for Israel's destruction, but not that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
