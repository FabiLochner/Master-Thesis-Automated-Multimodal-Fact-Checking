From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

[Columbia University](/wiki/Columbia_University "Columbia University")
 in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City")
, [New York](/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)")
, has seen numerous instances of student protests, particularly beginning in the late 20th century.

1811 Riotous Commencement
-------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: 1811 Riotous Commencement")\
\]

The 1811 commencement was cancelled midway through its proceedings after graduating senior John B. He went on to lead 80,000 workers in the 1937 [Little Steel Strike](/wiki/Little_Steel_Strike "Little Steel Strike")
.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 As of 2018[\[update\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit)
, the university has not apologized for expelling him.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

Protests of 1968
----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Protests of 1968")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG/250px-Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG)](/wiki/File:Hamilton_statue_at_Columbia_University_IMG_0958.JPG)

[Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
 was occupied by protesting students in 1968

Main article: [Columbia University protests of 1968](/wiki/Columbia_University_protests_of_1968 "Columbia University protests of 1968")

Students initiated a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. Students barricaded themselves inside [Low Library](/wiki/Low_Memorial_Library "Low Memorial Library")
, [Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)

The protests achieved two of their stated goals. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [Princeton University](/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University")
 for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [Jadwin Gymnasium](/wiki/Jadwin_Gymnasium "Jadwin Gymnasium")
 was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)
 At least 30 Columbia students were suspended by the administration as a result of the protests. The protests hurt Columbia financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate money to the school.

Protests against racism and apartheid
-------------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Student_activism_at_Columbia_University&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Protests against racism and apartheid")\
\]

Further student protests, including hunger strike and more barricades of [Hamilton Hall](/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University) "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)")
 and the Business School during the late 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the [apartheid](/wiki/History_of_South_Africa_in_the_apartheid_era "History of South Africa in the apartheid era")
 regime in South Africa.[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)
 A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa."

_“The Dismissal of Bob Burke. This became our major point of difference.”

Burke said he warned Dean Hawkes that his [expulsion would have a chilling effect on student speech](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 at Columbia: “I told the Dean that if I were expelled it would appear to the student body that this action was an attempt to frighten the ASU out of any action of significance and to frighten politically conscious students so that they would not take part in ASU affairs.”

Soon after Robert Burke led an anti-Nazi protest at Columbia in 1936, he was expelled. In 2025, history repeats itself over and over.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Robert Burke was a junior at Columbia University who dared to protest the administration’s ties to Nazi Germany in 1936. Butler never spoke with them](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 again.

So, Columbia students made their divestment demands known through a nonviolent protest at his home.

Robert Burke Leads Anti-Nazi Protest at Columbia President’s House
------------------------------------------------------------------

Before Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University, he was the president-elect of his junior class and a leading member of the America Student Union at the university. Heidelberg Comes to Columbia” is a 20-page document from the ACLU and other organizations that details the events at Columbia University that led up to Burke’s expulsion and its aftermath in 1936. While Oxford, Cambridge and others [rejected the invitation](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 and hoped their absence would serve as a “condemnation of Nazi attacks upon academic freedom,” Columbia University agreed to attend, setting the stage for anti-fascist protests on its campus.

Columbia Accepts Invitation to Heidelberg University
----------------------------------------------------

Columbia Assistant Secretary Philip Hayden announced on February 28, 1936 that the administration would send a representative to Heidelberg because “it is the custom of Columbia University to be represented, whenever conveniently possible, at all celebrations of educational institutions here and abroad.”

_Writer’s note: Made in collaboration with the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Student Union chapter at Columbia and the Burke Defense Committee, a 20-page document called “_[_The Dismissal of Bob Burke. Student journalists [argued that the university’s presence](https://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/?a=d&d=cs19360302-01.2.12&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------)
 “will in effect be bestowing a benediction upon the spoliation of education and culture by the Hitler regime.”

They continued: “\[Columbia\] will be giving its approval to those who have suppressed academic freedom, perverted the content and teaching of all branches of learning, fostered a fraudulent ‘race science,’ dismissed and persecuted scholars on religious, political and racial grounds.”

Soon after Hayden’s announcement, the American Student Union (ASU) chapter voted to oppose the university’s participation and organized demonstrations against it. The article reads: “Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and other Nazi functionaries will be among the most prominent hosts to scholars and scientists who have been invited to represent the universities of the world.”

In other words, it had become clear to students that this engagement with Heidelberg University was not simply an academic courtesy, but rather a tacit endorsement of the Nazi takeover of universities and colleges.

Nearly 45 days after President Butler promised to meet with students and reconsider the invitation, [Philip Hayden told the student committee](https://archive.org/details/TheDismissalOfBobBurke.HeidelbergComesToColumbia/mode/2up)
 that “Dr. Butler has nothing to see the committee about.”

In response to the administration’s stonewalling, Robert Burke led a group of 300 students onto South Field on the evening of May 12, 1936."

In 1933, soon after Hitler came to power, the Nazis began expelling Jewish students and dismissing Jewish professors from their universities. On campuses across Germany, Nazis and their sympathizers publicly burned books written by Jews and other perceived enemies (including books by Columbia anthropologist Franz Boas).

Just months after the first book burnings, Columbia president Nicholas Murray Butler welcomed Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States, to Morningside Heights, insisting that he be accorded “the greatest courtesy and respect.” In Cambridge, Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School, accepted an honorary degree from the University of Berlin.

Columbia students stage a mock book burning in 1936 to protest Nicholas Murray Butler's decision to send a delegate to the University of Heidelberg's 550th anniversary celebration. In the aftermath of the expulsion in 1933 of 15 Jews from university faculty positions in Germany, the newspaper called on Butler to hire them as Columbia professors. After a huge Jewish-sponsored anti-Nazi rally was held in Madison Square Garden in March 1933, the _Crimson_ opined that the rally “proved nothing” since Hitler had not been provided with a defense. “It is truly shameful,” writes Norwood, “that the administration, alumni, and student leaders of America’s most prominent university, who were in a position to influence American opinion at a critical time, remained indifferent to Germany’s terrorist campaign against the Jews and instead, on many occasions, assisted the Nazis in their efforts to gain acceptance in the West.”

Norwood, a professor of history at the University of Oklahoma, reveals how widespread this attitude was among administrators, professors, and students at some of America’s elite universities, who not only argued that academic life should be free of political considerations, but actually supported the Nazi regime. Aside from Harvard and Columbia, Norwood deals with several other colleges and universities, including the Seven Sisters, several Catholic universities, and the University of Virginia. In some ways, the student reaction to Columbia’s entanglement with the Third Reich in the 1930s foreshadowed what would happen a generation later when students challenged their university administrations over such issues as the war in Vietnam and civil rights.

Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University in 1936 for leading an anti-Nazi protest, according to multiple sources. One source states the protest was against Columbia's decision to send a representative to Heidelberg University. The protest took place on May 12, 1936, and Burke was expelled on June 16, 1936. Burke was also the president-elect of his junior class and a leading member of the American Student Union.

The sources include an article from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism_at_Columbia_University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism_at_Columbia_University)), and articles from Medium ([https://medium.com/@blurredbylines/when-columbia-university-expelled-robert-burke-for-anti-nazi-protests-in-1936-d9f236c91794](https://medium.com/@blurredbylines/when-columbia-university-expelled-robert-burke-for-anti-nazi-protests-in-1936-d9f236c91794)) and Blurred Bylines ([https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/](https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/)). <image:6154>, <image:6158>

New Footage Confirms ICE Lied and Had No Reason to Detain Mahmoud Khalil
========================================================================

Despite false claims from the Trump administration that Khalil tried to flee, Columbia surveillance footage again confirms he complied. This directly contradicts the Trump administration’s false claims that Mahmoud Khalil attempted to flee when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers illegally arrested him in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. Khalil’s legal team:**

“They want to conflate any speech for the rights of Palestinians with speech that’s supporting terrorism, which is totally wrong,” he said.

“It’s a message that they want to make an example out of me, even if you are a legal resident… that we will find a way to come after you, to punish you, if you speak, against what we want.”

Khalil told the Associated Press that if his claim against the Trump administration is successful, he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in Trump’s “failed” effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech.

Mahmoud Khalil describes conditions at ICE detention facility

01:24

CNN  — 

Detained for more than 100 days without charge, and with the threat of deportation looming over him, Palestinian student activist [Mahmoud Khalil](https://cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 was convinced he would eventually prevail.

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Khalil, who is now back with his young family, describes the months languishing in a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, and the pain of being denied permission to be present at his son’s birth.

“It was a very, very dehumanizing experience, for someone who was not accused of any crime, whatsoever,” said Khalil, a green card holder who had no formal criminal or civil charges brought against him.

His detention sparked outrage across the US.

On Thursday Khalil’s lawyers [filed a claim](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 against the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned, prosecuted and portrayed as antisemitic as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The 30-year-old, who was born in a refugee camp in Syria before going on to graduate from Columbia, had played a prominent role negotiating on behalf of pro-Palestinian protesters at the university.

Once taken, he was moved first to New Jersey, then to Texas, and finally to an ICE detention center in Louisiana – more than 1,000 miles away from his wife, a US citizen, who was then eight months pregnant.

“I was literally moved from one place to another, like an object,” he recalled, referring to his [transfers](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/us/mahmoud-khalil-palestinian-activist-trump)
 to different detention facilities. “I was shackled all the time,” he said.

But, he said, the days in the detention center never broke his spirit.

“From the moment that I was detained, I knew that I would eventually prevail,” he said.

“What I simply did is protesting a genocide.”

Israel has repeatedly pushed back against claims its war in Gaza is a genocide.

Protesters rally in support of detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in March in New York.

Jason DeCrow/AP

The food in the ICE center in Louisiana was nearly “inedible,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security in a statement called Khalil’s claim “absurd.”

His arrest outside his apartment on Columbia University’s campus in New York City in March, as he returned home from a dinner with his wife, felt like a “kidnap,” he told Amanpour.

Plainclothes agents had followed him into the lobby of his building, and threatened his wife with arrest if she didn’t separate from him, he said. His lawyers have vehemently pushed back on that assertion.

After accusing him – without evidence – of being a Hamas sympathizer, the Trump administration, who sought Khalil’s [deportation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/index.html)
, said it was [justified](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-green-card-trump-administration)
 because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident. After being served meat that made him vomit, he switched to vegetarian options, he said.

The center was bitterly cold, but repeated requests for blankets were ignored, he said.

“The moment you enter such ICE facilities, your rights literally stay outside,” he told Amanpour.

CNN has previously reached out to ICE for comment about the conditions at its Louisiana facilities – its policies indicate detention is non-punitive. The GEO Group, the corporation that runs the facility where Khalil was held, has denied allegations of abuse.

The Trump administration has argued that Khalil’s actions pose a threat to its foreign policy goal of combatting antisemitism. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration’s deportation policies.

‘I couldn’t hold him’
---------------------

Amid the inedible food, the cold, and fear he might be deported, one moment stood out as the hardest to bear – immigration officials denying him permission to be present at the birth of his firstborn child.

Attorneys for Khalil in May said officials at the Louisiana center cited a “blanket no-contact visitation policy” and unspecified security concerns as part of their reason to deny the request.

“Missing the birth of my child."

Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?
==========================================================================

20 June 2025

ShareSave

Phil McCauslandBBC News, New York

ShareSave

! On 20 June, a judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released.

Born in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of "un-American activity".

Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. They accused the government of "open repression of student activism and political speech".

Mr Khalil's arrest was the highest-profile in Trump's crackdown on international student protesters, as video of his arrest whipped around social media and the birth of his first child in April, which he was still detained, made international headlines.

Khalil's work for UK in Middle East
-----------------------------------

Born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor.

More recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.

The UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago.

Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.

The case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.

Mr Khalil was held in an immigration facility in Louisiana for three months before a federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump could no longer detain or deport him. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".

The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.

Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.

After Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of "leading activities aligned to Hamas" but did not provide further details.

The White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.

Legal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.

"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration," said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.

Khalil had been briefly suspended from Columbia
-----------------------------------------------

Watch: The BBC speaks to Columbia student after suspension

Amid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.

At the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.

It is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.

"\[They said\] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me)," he said in an interview in early May. From then until mid-June he was held by immigration authorities on two charges.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue Mr Khalil's presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences".

In early June, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz [ruled Rubio's justification for detaining](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd28em88ezo)
 Mr Khalil was likely unconstitutional and said the US government could not detain or deport a legal US resident under that reasoning.

Attorneys for the Trump administration then said Mr Khalil was being held for a different reason, failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024.

But on 20 June, Judge Farbiarz ordered him to be released on bail.

The White House maintains the judge did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release and said they plan to appeal.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was arrested by ICE in March 2025. The Wikipedia article states he was arrested on March 8, 2025, and the ACLU and CNN also report his arrest in March 2025. The BBC article mentions that Khalil was facing deportation. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Khalil was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.

The evidence suggests that Khalil's arrest was related to his activism and protests. The ACLU and Khalil's legal team claim the arrest was in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian rights. The BBC article links the arrest to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators.

To fully verify the claim, information about Khalil's immigration status at the time of his arrest is missing.

# Your Judgement

The provided evidence from multiple sources, including Wikipedia, ACLU, CNN, and BBC, confirms that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, was arrested and detained by ICE in March 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Khalil was a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. at the time of his arrest.

Since the claim's veracity depends on Khalil's immigration status, which is not explicitly confirmed by the provided evidence, the most appropriate decision is `not enough information`.

The destruction of cultural heritage during the [Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip "Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip")
 has included the damage and destruction by Israel of hundreds of culturally or historically significant buildings, libraries, museums, and other repositories of knowledge in [Gaza](/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")
, alongside the destruction of [intangible cultural heritage](/wiki/Intangible_cultural_heritage "Intangible cultural heritage")

[\[3\]](#cite_note-acgwo-3)
 Nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed and 1.9 million people displaced.[\[4\]](#cite_note-UG-4)
[\[5\]](#cite_note-HM-5)

There are hundreds of cultural heritage sites in Gaza, including more than 300 architectural heritage sites. The philosopher [Jeff Malpas](/wiki/Jeff_Malpas "Jeff Malpas")
 highlights the use of destruction to exert authority and control over other groups as a significant issue in Israel–Palestine relations.[\[22\]](#cite_note-22)

Cultural sites are protected under Article 53 of [Protocol I](/wiki/Protocol_I "Protocol I")
 of the [Geneva Conventions](/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions")

Impact
------

### Overview

On 7 October 2023, [Hamas attacked Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
, killing more than a thousand people (including more than 800 civilians) and taking some 251 hostages.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)
 In response Israel began a counterattack on Gaza; its initial focus was on the northern Gaza Strip, and bombing intensified towards the end of 2023 and expanded to the south with ground invasions to the extent that more half of the buildings in the Strip had been damaged or destroyed by January 2024.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)
 [More than 46,600 Palestinians had been killed](/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war "Casualties of the Gaza war")
 by the time of a ceasefire in January 2025, with the majority consisting of women and children, and there was extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Israel's bombing campaign is one of the most destructive in recent history,[\[33\]](#cite_note-33)
 and nearly 80% of the buildings in the Gaza Strip were damaged or destroyed during the conflict by July 2025. In February 2024, they reported that 44 people involved with arts and culture were killed and around 200 historic buildings were damaged or destroyed, along with 12 museums and numerous cultural centres.[\[35\]](#cite_note-moc-35)
 [Intangible cultural heritage](/wiki/Intangible_cultural_heritage "Intangible cultural heritage")
 has also been affected through the loss of centres that provided community activities and supported Gazan culture.[\[36\]](#cite_note-36)
 In January 2025, shortly after the ceasefire, the Ministry of Culture began a process of evaluating the impact on the ground.[\[37\]](#cite_note-37)
 [UNESCO](/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO")
 has an ongoing damage assessment. A recent report by the Palestinian culture ministry into Israeli damage to Palestinian heritage said Israel's bombardment of Gaza had destroyed 207 buildings of cultural or historical significance, including 144 in the old city and 25 religious sites.

A mounting humanitarian crisis
------------------------------

The UN estimates that approximately 92 per cent of all residential buildings in Gaza – around 436,000 homes – have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The resulting debris amounts to nearly 50 million tonnes – an overwhelming quantity of rubble that would take decades to remove under current conditions.

Humanitarian organizations warn that the delay in debris removal and body recovery is not only deepening psychological trauma across Gaza but also threatens to become a public health and environmental catastrophe.

Gaza: Destruction of vital lifting gear halts search for thousands buried under rubble
======================================================================================

22 April 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Families in Gaza were holding on to the slim chance of finding loved ones buried under the ruins of destroyed homes – but that hope is fading fast.

The destruction of key heavy machinery on Tuesday following reported Israeli airstrikes has brought rescue and recovery efforts to a standstill, making it even harder to reach the estimated 11,000 bodies still trapped under the debris.

According to local authorities, the strikes put a halt to all solid waste and debris removal operations, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at a briefing in New York.

Until recently, bulldozers and other excavation equipment had been used in painstaking efforts to recover bodies from the wreckage.

One bulldozer operated by Atif Nasr – who before the war worked building and repairing roads – had become vital in the grim task of extracting the remains of loved ones from the rubble.

He was interviewed by a _UN News_ correspondent in Gaza before the strike but now his grim but vital work has come to a standstill after his vehicle was destroyed.

![Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.](https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production%20Library/22-04-2025-UN-News-Gaza.bmp/image3000x3000.jpg "Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.")

UN News

Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.

Months trapped in rubble
------------------------

The Dahdouh family managed to recover the remains of their son, Omar, from the ruins of their home, almost a year after he was killed in an airstrike which levelled their seven-story building.

Standing at the site, Omar’s brother, Moayad, shared the family’s ordeal.

“His body remained trapped under the rubble for nearly a year. After the war, we tried to retrieve him, but with the building so large and with no heavy machinery available, it was impossible.

“We searched everywhere for a bulldozer to reach the ground floor – where Omar had been – but during the war, Israeli forces destroyed or burned all the bulldozers or excavators that could have helped us.”

A decent burial
---------------

In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, the Dajani family continues to live in what’s left of their destroyed home, where the bodies of three of their children remain buried.

Their father Ali remembers the time they died with a heavy heart.

“We fled to the beach area during the bombings."

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. As of January 2025, Israel had destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries. The article includes an image of a destroyed mosque in the Jabalia area of the Gaza Strip <image:1>. The Old City of Gaza was severely damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could depict a location in Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation results. The web search results confirm that Gaza has suffered extensive damage to its buildings. Specifically, the search results mention that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and 92% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed by April 2025.

The claim states the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. While the evidence supports the extensive damage to buildings in Gaza, it does not explicitly confirm the image's specific location or the extent of the destruction in December 2024.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the exact state of destruction in December 2024 cannot be verified.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Gaza has suffered significant destruction, and the image's geolocation suggests it could be in Palestine. However, the claim specifies the image's context as Gaza being "completely destroyed" in December 2024. While the evidence confirms widespread damage, it doesn't provide enough information to verify the image's specific location or the complete destruction in December 2024.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:33>)
web_search("Gaza destroyed buildings")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.59, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.05, 'Tunisia': 0.02, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Malta': 0.01, 'Russia': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Wikipedia article, nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. As of January 2025, Israel had destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries. The article includes an image of a destroyed mosque in the Jabalia area of the Gaza Strip <image:1>. The Old City of Gaza was severely damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.

A UN News article from April 2025 reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. <image:k> shows a bulldozer removing rubble in Gaza City.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could depict a location in Palestine, as indicated by the geolocation results. The web search results confirm that Gaza has suffered extensive damage to its buildings. Specifically, the search results mention that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and 92% of residential buildings were damaged or destroyed by April 2025.

The claim states the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. While the evidence supports the extensive damage to buildings in Gaza, it does not explicitly confirm the image's specific location or the extent of the destruction in December 2024.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the exact state of destruction in December 2024 cannot be verified.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

The United Nations warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the [besieged Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ji69c500003b6nj5d2idsq)
 in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped.

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing. For comparison, the UN previously [reported](https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm22010.doc.htm)

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said [it has hit more than 3,200 Hezbollah targets](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jjhsxq000o3b6nirr3fxf1)
 since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1, with approximately 300 targets hit in the last 24 hours.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)
 as the United States seeks to move forward with long-stalled negotiations to bring back the hostages and end the war in Gaza in the wake of Yahya Sinwar’s death.

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

At least four people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night.

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)

 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

The last time Israel invaded southern Lebanon and engaged in ground combat with Hezbollah was during the month-long [2006 Lebanon War](/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War")
.[\[93\]](#cite_note-apnews20240930-99)

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[94\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-100)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[95\]](#cite_note-aj-101)
 which quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges impacting areas in or around [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
 of [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
.[\[96\]](#cite_note-102)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[88\]](#cite_note-foreignaffairs20240923-94)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
.[\[97\]](#cite_note-Hezbollah_warns-103)

 From 8 October 2023 to 20 September 2024, Hezbollah has launched 1,900 cross border attacks, and Israel has launched another 8,300.[\[99\]](#cite_note-aljazeera20240925-105)
 The fighting killed 564 in Lebanon (including 133 civilians),[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon,[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[101\]](#cite_note-107)

Israel requested that Hezbollah implement [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701")
 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) specifically mentions airstrikes on that date.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) also supports this, reporting on the ongoing conflict and an Israeli strike near a hospital in Beirut on the same date.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the provided image to the attacks. Therefore, while the claim about the date and location is supported, the image's specific context remains unverified.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The provided evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to the attacks.

Since the claim is about the image and its context, and the evidence does not verify the image's context, the claim is not fully supported. `not enough information`

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) reports on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024, which resulted in casualties. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and resulted in an Israeli victory and a ceasefire agreement.

The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, that hit branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:35>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) specifically mentions airstrikes on that date.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) also supports this, reporting on the ongoing conflict and an Israeli strike near a hospital in Beirut on the same date.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the provided image to the attacks. Therefore, while the claim about the date and location is supported, the image's specific context remains unverified.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide additional context. While the search confirms that explosions over buildings at night in Lebanon occurred, it does not directly confirm that the image in the claim depicts an Israeli attack on October 21, 2024. The evidence includes images of explosions in Lebanon, but none of them are the same as the image in the claim. The Guardian published a video of explosions in Beirut, but it was from June 5, 2025, which is not the date in the claim.

Therefore, the claim's veracity remains unconfirmed because the image's specific context is not verified.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) also supports this, reporting on the ongoing conflict and an Israeli strike near a hospital in Beirut on the same date.

However, the evidence does not explicitly link the provided image to the attacks. Therefore, while the claim about the date and location is supported, the image's specific context remains unverified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an image of an explosion over buildings at night in Lebanon (<image:9608>). The Associated Press also published an image of an explosion over a building at night in Lebanon (<image:9609>). The Guardian published a video on June 5, 2025, showing explosions in Beirut as Israel carried out airstrikes (<image:9610>).


## Elaboration
The image search results provide additional context. While the search confirms that explosions over buildings at night in Lebanon occurred, it does not directly confirm that the image in the claim depicts an Israeli attack on October 21, 2024. The evidence includes images of explosions in Lebanon, but none of them are the same as the image in the claim. The Guardian published a video of explosions in Beirut, but it was from June 5, 2025, which is not the date in the claim.

Therefore, the claim's veracity remains unconfirmed because the image's specific context is not verified.

While the search confirms that explosions over buildings at night in Lebanon occurred, it does not directly confirm that the image in the claim depicts an Israeli attack on October 21, 2024. The evidence includes images of explosions in Lebanon, but none of them are the same as the image in the claim. The Guardian published a video of explosions in Beirut, but it was from June 5, 2025, which is not the date in the claim.

Therefore, the claim's veracity remains unconfirmed because the image's specific context is not verified.


## Actions
```
image_search("GettyImages MAHMOD HAMS explosion building")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
GettyImages published an image of Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip ([https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997)). Amnesty International published an image of an explosion over buildings at night. fox47.com includes an image of an explosion over a building, credited to MAHMOD HAMS. <image:9611> <image:9612> <image:9613>


## Elaboration
The image search reveals that the image in the claim was taken by MAHMOD HAMS and is associated with explosions over buildings. However, the search results also show that the image is related to Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, not Lebanon. Therefore, the claim is likely false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. However, the image search results indicate that the image in the claim is associated with Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, not Lebanon. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While there were indeed Israeli attacks on Lebanon on that date, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan), the image itself, credited to MAHMOD HAMS, is associated with Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, according to image search results.

*   Israeli tanks enter Ebad-Alrahman in Gaza City, shell houses, residents flee
*   Church leaders in Gaza City refuse to evacuate amid conflict
*   Trump to chair meeting on Gaza, aims for resolution by year-end

CAIRO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Israeli tanks pushed into a new area on the edge of Gaza City overnight, destroying houses and prompting residents to flee, witnesses said, ahead of an expected meeting [on the war](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 to be chaired by U.S. [President Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)
 on Wednesday.

Tanks late on Tuesday entered into the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood on the northern edge of Gaza City and shelled houses, wounding several people and forcing many others, who had been taken by surprise, to move deeper into Gaza's largest city, residents said.

"All of a sudden, we heard that the tanks pushed into Ebad-Alrahman, the sounds of explosions became louder, and louder, and we saw people escaping towards our area," said Saad Abed, 60, a former construction worker.

"If no truce is reached, we will see the tanks outside our homes," he told Reuters via a chat app from his house in Jala Street in Gaza City, around one kilometre (0.6 mile) from the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood.

Israel has said it is preparing to launch a [new offensive](/world/middle-east/netanyahu-says-new-gaza-offensive-will-start-soon-2025-08-10/)
 in Gaza City, which it describes as Hamas' last bastion. It was unclear who would be present at the Trump meeting.

TANKS PULL BACK, BOMBARDMENTS CONTINUE
--------------------------------------

Israeli tanks retreated from the edge of Gaza City later on Wednesday to the Jabalia area, where they have been operating for months, although bombardments on three of the city's eastern suburbs - Shejaia, Zeitoun and Sabra - continued.

Gaza health authorities said Israeli fire had killed at least 20 people, including a four-year-old girl, across the enclave.

The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces were operating in Jabalia and the outskirts of Gaza City to "dismantle terror infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists".

It said it had killed a senior Hamas militant, Mahmoud Al-Aswad, who served as the group's head of general security intelligence for the West Gaza area, on August 22. Around half of the enclave's two million people are currently living there and Israel has said they will be told to evacuate.

Thousands have already left, but church leaders in the city said on Wednesday they were staying put, as leaving Gaza City and "trying to flee to the south would be nothing less than a death sentence".

"For this reason, the clergy and nuns have decided to remain and continue to care for all those who will be in the compounds," a joint statement by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said "evacuating Gaza City is inevitable" and Israel had begun facilitating the entry of tents into the enclave.

"Before transitioning to the next phase in the war, I wish to confirm that there are vast empty areas in the southern Strip, just as is the case in the central camps and in Al-Mawasi. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that Trump would [chair a meeting](/world/middle-east/trump-chair-gaza-meeting-washington-top-us-israeli-diplomats-also-meet-2025-08-26/)
 on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel's war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year.

The U.S. Thousands of [Israelis rallied](/world/middle-east/israelis-rally-against-gaza-war-former-hostage-longs-her-friends-be-freed-2025-08-26/)
 across the country on Tuesday demanding an end to the conflict and the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza.

Israel has yet to publicly respond to the latest 60-day U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, which it had previously accepted and which Hamas last week agreed to.

The war was triggered on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages, Israeli tallies show.

Israel's subsequent military campaign against Hamas has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel disputes fatality figures by the health ministry in the Hamas-run strip.

Israeli tanks advance into Gaza's Deir al-Balah city for first time

Residents of Deir al-Balah have been fleeing southern areas of Deir al-Balah in response to Israeli military orders

Israeli tanks have advanced into Deir al-Balah in central Gaza for the first time, triggering a fresh wave of displacement among civilians.

Local journalists said tanks entered southern and eastern areas of the city on Monday amid heavy air and artillery strikes, a day after Israel ordered residents in several areas to leave.

Deir al-Balah is one of the few areas of Gaza where Israel has not conducted a major ground operation during its 21-month war with Hamas.

The UK and 24 other nations meanwhile condemned the killing of hundreds of Palestinians at food aid points. "The suffering of civilians has reached new depths."

The UN said the evacuation order in Deir al-Balah affected tens of thousands of Palestinians and dealt "another devastating blow" to humanitarian efforts.

The neighbourhoods contain dozens of camps for displaced families as well as aid warehouses, health clinics, and critical water infrastructure.

Local journalists told the BBC that Israeli tanks and other military vehicles pushed into eastern Deir al-Balah on Monday from the direction of the Kissufim crossing and under the cover of heavy artillery and air strikes.

Dozens of shells struck the Abu al-Ajin and Hikr al-Jami areas, they said.

Night-time footage shared on social media showed explosions and the sound of gunfire. <image:9677>!A BBC map titled "Israeli evacuation or 'no go' zones across Gaza". The map shows four Israeli military corridors which cut across Gaza, and is shaded to show how almost all of the territory has been under evacuation orders. At least 20 of the 50 hostages still in captivity are believed to be still alive.

Hostages' families have expressed concern that an offensive could endanger them.

"Can anyone \[promise\] to us that this decision will not come at the cost of losing our loved ones?" they said on Sunday.

According to the UN, about 87.8% of Gaza is now covered by Israeli evacuation orders or is within Israeli militarized zones, leaving the 2.1 million population squeezed into about 46 sq km of land where essential services have collapsed.

Meanwhile, the World Food Programme warned Gaza's hunger crisis had "reached new levels of desperation" after more than 100 people were reportedly killed while waiting for food over the weekend.

On Sunday, at least 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of WFP aid lorries near the Zikim crossing point in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Nearly one person in three is not eating for days," the WFP said.

"Only a massive scale-up in food aid distributions can stabilise this spiralling situation."

In their joint statement, the group of 25 nations including European countries, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan condemned what they said was the "drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children".

"It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid."

It condemned Hamas's refusal to release all its hostages, and said a "negotiated ceasefire offers the best hope of bringing them home".

The Israeli foreign ministry said on Sunday that 4,400 lorry loads of humanitarian aid had entered Gaza from Israel since mid-May, when it partially eased a total blockade on deliveries that lasted 11 weeks. Another 700 lorry loads were waiting to be picked up by the UN from the Gaza side of its crossing points, it added.

Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and led to 251 others being taken hostage.

Israeli attacks have since killed at least 58,895 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.

According to local media today, several individuals were killed and others injured during a clash with the Israeli army in western rural Daraa, southern Syria.

The SANA news agency stated that "at least 11 people were killed, and 27 others were injured," adding that Israeli forces withdrew after hours of incursion around the city of Nawa, the town of Al-Jubayliyah, and its dam in rural Daraa, retreating toward the Tel Ahmar base.

In this context, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said: "During the past night, forces from the 474th Golan Brigade operated in the Tasil area in southern Syria, seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure."

He added: "During the operation, several armed individuals opened fire at our forces operating in the area, prompting them to respond and eliminate several armed terrorists through ground and air strikes. The Israel Defense Forces will not allow a military threat inside Syria and will act against it."

The Israeli attack comes after airstrikes carried out by Israeli fighter jets during the night on the Scientific Research Center building in the Masaken Barzeh district of Damascus, as well as targeting Hama Military Airport and the Tiyas (T4) Airbase east of Homs.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Damascus authority stated in a statement that "the Israeli attack resulted in the near-total destruction of Hama Military Airport and the injury of dozens of civilians and military personnel."

For the first time since Assad’s fall seven months ago, Israel was the target on Monday night of a small-scale rocket attack from southwestern Syria. The attack caused no casualties, or damage.

Authorities in the southern province of Daraa said nine civilians were killed and several wounded in Israeli shelling near the city of Nawa.

The provincial government said the bombardment came amid Israel's deepest ground incursion into southern Syria so far.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead were local gunmen who were killed "while attempting to confront Israeli forces, following calls by the mosques in the area for jihad against the Israeli incursion".

According to the Israeli military, its forces were conducting operations in the Tasil area, near Nawa, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure" when "several gunmen fired at our forces".

They "responded by firing at them and eliminated several armed terrorists from the ground and from the air", a spokesperson said. The onslaught on military targets and in the southern province of Daraa killed at least 13 people.

Men check the scene of an Israeli strike in Syria's southern Hama governorate on April 3, 2025. There were no Israeli casualties.

"The IDF (military) will not allow the existence of a military threat in Syria and will act against it," the spokesperson added.

Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/benjamin-netanyahu/)
 demanded in February that southern Syria be completely demilitarised and said his government would not accept the presence of the forces of the new Islamist-led government near Israeli territory.

In December, Netanyahu ordered troops to enter the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces along the 1974 armistice line on the [Golan Heights](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/golan-heights/)
.

'Unjustified escalation'
------------------------

On Wednesday, Israel hit targets across Syria including in the [Damascus](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/damascus/)
 area.

The Syrian foreign ministry said the strikes resulted in the "near-total destruction" of a military airport in the central province of Hama and wounded dozens of civilians and soldiers.

"This unjustified escalation is a deliberate attempt to destabilise Syria and exacerbate the suffering of its people," it said in a statement on Telegram.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz hit back with a warning to Sharaa in which he pointedly referred to the president by the nom de guerre he used as an Islamist rebel commander.

"I warn Syrian leader Jolani: If you allow hostile forces to enter Syria and threaten Israeli security interests, you will pay a heavy price," he said.

"The air force's activity yesterday near the airports in T4, Hama and the Damascus area sends a clear message and serves as a warning for the future," he added.

Read more[Israel strikes military targets in southern Syria over national security concerns](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250317-israel-southern-syria)

The Israeli military said its forces "struck military capabilities that remained at the Syrian bases of Hama and T4, along with additional remaining military infrastructure sites in the area of Damascus".

Israel has said it wants to prevent advanced weapons from falling into the hands of the new authorities, whom it considers jihadists.

Sharaa fought for Al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-led invasion of 2003 and later set up a Syrian branch of the jihadist network before breaking off all ties.

The Syrian ministry said the Israeli strikes came as the country was trying to rebuild after 14 years of war, calling it a strategy to "normalise violence within the country".

During a visit to [Jerusalem](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jerusalem/)
 last month, EU foreign policy chief [Kaja Kallas](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/kaja-kallas/)
 said that Israeli strikes on Syria were "unnecessary" and risked worsening the situation.

Syria accuses Israel of stoking a deadly destabilisation campaign
=================================================================

Middle East

Syria on Thursday condemned deadly Israeli strikes across the country as a "flagrant violation" of its sovereignty, after Israel said it struck "military capabilities". © Abdulaziz Ketaz, AFP

[Syria](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/syria/)
 accused [Israel](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/israel/)
 on Thursday of mounting a deadly destabilisation campaign after a wave of strikes hit military targets, including an airport, and ground incursions left 13 people dead. 

Israel said it responded to fire from gunmen during an operation in southern Syria and warned interim President [Ahmed al-Sharaa](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/abu-mohammed-al-jolani/)
 that he would face severe consequences if its security was threatened.

Israel has carried out an extensive bombing campaign against Syrian military assets since Islamist-led rebels toppled longtime strongman [Bashar al-Assad](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/bashar-al-assad/)
 in November."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:42> This image shows Israel military forces entering the town of Tasil in the countryside of Daraa on foot in February 2025."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:42>)
web_search("Israel military forces Tasil Daraa")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.68, 'Israel': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.03, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties](https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties)) reported on clashes between the Israeli army and armed individuals in Daraa, southern Syria, in April 2025, with operations in the Tasil area. FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) also reported on Israeli military operations in the Tasil area near Nawa, Syria, in April 2025, with the Israeli military stating they were conducting operations in the Tasil area, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure".

Syria Weekly ([https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation](https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation)) discussed Israeli retaliatory artillery strikes in western Daraa, including areas near Tasil, in June 2025. <image:42>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could depict Israeli military forces. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Furthermore, web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot. The web search results mention operations in Tasil, but do not provide any visual confirmation.

The claim's date of February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence, which mentions events in April and June 2025.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's specific context, including the exact date and the nature of the military activity depicted.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Israeli military operations have occurred in the Tasil area, and the image's geolocation data suggests a possible location in Israel or Palestine.

One image is from Syria Direct ([https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/](https://syriadirect.org/israel-in-syria-permanent-fortifications-and-attempts-to-win-over-residents/)) <image:7735> and another from The Long War Journal ([https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php](https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2025/03/israel-strikes-gunmen-in-southern-syria-damascus-says-civilians-killed.php)) <image:7736>.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results confirm the presence of Israeli military forces, they do not directly confirm the claim that the image depicts Israeli forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The search results include images of Israeli soldiers and military vehicles, but none of them match the original image.

The claim remains unverified due to the lack of direct visual confirmation of the specific event described in the claim.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties](https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties)) reported on clashes between the Israeli army and armed individuals in Daraa, southern Syria, in April 2025, with operations in the Tasil area. FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) also reported on Israeli military operations in the Tasil area near Nawa, Syria, in April 2025, with the Israeli military stating they were conducting operations in the Tasil area, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure".

Syria Weekly ([https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation](https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation)) discussed Israeli retaliatory artillery strikes in western Daraa, including areas near Tasil, in June 2025. <image:42>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could depict Israeli military forces. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Furthermore, web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot. The web search results mention operations in Tasil, but do not provide any visual confirmation.

The claim's date of February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence, which mentions events in April and June 2025.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's specific context, including the exact date and the nature of the military activity depicted.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial fact-check revealed that the image could depict Israeli military forces, and there were reports of Israeli operations in the Tasil area. However, the evidence did not confirm the specific context of the image, including the date and the nature of the military activity. The subsequent image search provided additional context, confirming the presence of Israeli military forces, but did not directly confirm the claim.

From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php): 
Content: "Algeria and Somalia requested the meeting after the Permanent Mission of Syria to the UN sent a 7 April letter to the Council (S/2025/216) concerning recent Israeli attacks on Syrian territory. Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix and Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Mohamed Khaled Khiari are expected to brief.

The 7 April letter described Israeli attacks on Syrian territory as a “serious threat” to international peace and security and a violation of international law, the UN Charter, relevant UN resolutions, and the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and Syria. Syria’s letter follows the most recent series of Israeli airstrikes, which took place on 2 and 3 April and [reportedly](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce92g5nk55eo)
 hit Syrian airbases and military sites—including the Hama and Tiyas (T4) airbases—as well as military infrastructure in Damascus. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-says-several-gunmen-eliminated-after-firing-on-troops-in-southern-syria/#:~:text=Tasil%20is%20located%20some%2013,regime%20to%20Islamist%2Dled%20rebels.)
 said that their incursion was a response to fire from gunmen on Israeli troops operating in the southern Syrian town of Tasil overnight while they were “seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure”.

Meanwhile, the strikes on the T4 airbase in the Homs province followed [reports](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-moves-take-control-syrias-strategic-t4-air-base-sources)
 that Türkiye is planning to establish control of the base and deploy air defence systems there, in line with an agreement currently under discussion between the authorities in Damascus and Ankara that would commit Türkiye to supporting Syrian defence and counterterrorism capabilities. Senior Israeli officials have [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 stated that they are not seeking a conflict with Türkiye but do not want the country to establish itself on Israel’s borders and will seek to prevent it from assuming responsibility for Syrian military bases. *   [Monthly  \

Syria: Briefing
===============

Tomorrow morning (10 April), the Security Council will hold an open briefing on [**Syria**](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/syria/)
. (This agreement ended the Yom Kippur War and established in the Golan an area of separation, which is a UN-monitored buffer zone, and an area of limitation, where Israeli and Syrian troops and equipment are restricted.) In the letter, Syria condemned what it called Israeli “aggression” on its territory and accused Israel of aiming to undermine the country’s stability and security, “prolong the suffering of its people”, and establish “a new occupation reality” on Syrian territory. It also called on the Council to “compel” Israel to cease its attacks on Syrian territory, withdraw its forces, and fully comply with the Disengagement of Forces Agreement.

Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military assets and expanded control over the Golan. Syria’s foreign ministry [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce92g5nk55eo)
 that the strikes resulted in the “near-total destruction” of the Hama airbase and injured “dozens” of civilians and military personnel. Israel also shelled the southern province of Daraa—killing nine civilians, [according](https://sana.sy/en/?p=351154)
 to Syrian state media—and launched a ground incursion into the province."

# Your Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

Iran has not yet submitted a formal response to the US proposal, which could reflect internal debates in Iran about how to reject the US zero enrichment demand in the proposal while also ensuring that the negotiations do not collapse.

**Likely Iranian-aligned militants launched a small-scale rocket attack from southwestern Syria into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on June 3.\[9\] This attack marks the first time that militants have attacked Israel from Syrian territory since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.\[10\]** Militants launched two rockets from Tasil, Daraa Province, into the southern Golan Heights.\[11\] The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) briefly operated in Tasil in April 2025.\[12\] Israeli media reported on June 3 that the rockets landed in open areas and did not cause any casualties.\[13\] The IDF launched several retaliatory air and artillery strikes targeting Syrian military sites and towns in southwestern Syria on June 3.\[14\] The targeted military sites included the new Syrian army’s 121st Brigade base near Kanaker, Rif Dimashq Province, and the 175th Brigade base near Izraa, Daraa Province.\[15\]

Two likely Iranian-aligned groups separately claimed responsibility for the June 3 rocket attack.\[16\] Neither group has previously conducted any attacks targeting Israel. <image:9762>

Several unspecified sources told Western media on May 27 that Israeli and Syrian officials are holding direct talks on joint security and “broader political understandings” to calm tensions and prevent further conflict.\[31\] Syrian President Ahmed al Shara also reportedly expressed willingness to normalize relations with Israel during meetings with US officials in April 2025.\[32\] Renewed tension between Israel and Syria could undermine the countries’ recent efforts to prevent military escalation and reach a political and diplomatic understanding.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz posted on X on June 3 that Israel holds Syrian President Ahmed al Shara “directly responsible for every threat” and attack on Israel from Syrian territory.\[24\] The IDF also stated on June 3 that the Syrian transitional government will continue to bear consequences “as long as hostile activity continues from its territory.”\[25\] The Syrian Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement that reaffirmed that Syria “has not and will not” pose a threat to any country in the region.\[26\] The ministry added that some external actors are seeking to destabilize the region to advance their own interests.\[27\] Israel has repeatedly expressed concern regarding threats to Israel from Syria since the fall of the Assad regime in December 2024.\[28\] The IDF has conducted ground and air operations in southern Syria since December 2024 with the aim of eliminating these threats, including Iranian-backed networks in Syria.\[29\] The Syrian transitional government has repeatedly called on Israel to withdraw from Syrian territory to the 1974 deconfliction line.\[30\] Israel and Syria have taken steps in recent weeks to ease tensions. Local media in Deir ez Zor Province reported that some divisions are struggling to pay their forces due to a lack of cash flow from the transitional government and some recruits are switching divisions to be paid.\[64\] Salaries are reportedly dependent on the leadership of each faction.\[65\] Turkey paid the salaries of Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) factions as of late May 2025, but it remains unclear if direct Turkish support to the SNA has persisted.\[66\] Qatar and Saudi Arabia have committed to fund public sector salaries in Syria to help with the transitional government’s budget shortfall, but it is unclear whether this assistance will include military salaries.\[67\]

**Sectarian-motivated attacks have increased across Syria since May 28 in correlation with an increase in Saraya Ansar al Sunnah propaganda.** CTP-ISW has recorded six instances of sectarian-motivated attacks since May 28, compared to a single attack between May 21 and 28.\[68\] Three of these attacks followed a clash between drug smugglers and General Security Service (GSS) forces in Qatana, Rif Dimashq Province, on May 30.\[69\]  Saraya Ansar al Sunnah abducted and executed a Druze man in Qatana on May 31.\[70\] Saraya Ansar al Sunnah propaganda posts more than doubled in the past week. <image:9761>](https://understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Hama%20City%20June%204%2C%202025.png)

**Iraq**

**The US Department of Defense denied any changes or delays to the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in a statement to Iraqi media on June 4.\[79\]** The United States and Iraq agreed in September 2024 that hundreds of US-led international coalition forces would withdraw from Iraq by September 2025 and that remaining forces would withdraw by the end of 2026.\[80\] The US Department of Defense announced in April 2025 that the United States will reduce the number of US forces deployed in Syria to “less than a thousand” in the coming months.\[81\] The US drawdown in Syria leaves a vacuum which Iraqi officials have warned ISIS could exploit to reconstitute and threaten Iraq.\[82\] The Iraqi federal government has reportedly considered postponing the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in recent months due to concerns that ISIS could exploit the fall of the Assad regime in Syria to threaten Iraq.

**Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) 26th Brigade Commander Maitham al Zaidi accused unspecified actors of imprisoning and interrogating PMF members for political purposes on June 4.** The PMF is an Iraqi state security service that includes many Iranian-backed Iraqi militias.\[83\] The PMF 26th Brigade, also known as the “Abbas Combat Division,” is loyal to Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani.\[84\] Zaidi claimed that unspecified actors imprisoned a PMF member for failing to provide his regiment commander with ten voting cards.\[85\] Zaidi also claimed that unspecified actors detained a different PMF member for 40 days because the member’s relatives support a rival candidate in the upcoming parliamentary elections.\[86\] Zaidi added that unspecified actors harshly interrogated a group of PMF recruits at a camp in southern Iraq after a candidate lost an election.\[87\]  The 2016 PMF Commission Law, which formalized the PMF as an independent entity reporting directly to the Iraqi prime minister, prohibits PMF members from associating with any political parties.\[88\] Zaidi called for comprehensive PMF reforms to ensure compliance with the law.\[89\]

**Arabian Peninsula**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Harden the Houthi regime against internal dissent in Houthi-controlled areas
*   Destroy the anti-Houthi opposition in order to control all of Yemen
*   Erode Israeli will to continue the war in the Gaza Strip

**The Houthis conducted a ballistic missile attack targeting Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel on June 3 as part of the Houthi campaign to enforce an economic blockade on Israel.\[90\]**  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted the Houthi missile.\[91\] Some international airlines have suspended flights to Israel through September 2025 due to concerns about Houthi attacks on Ben Gurion Airport.\[92\] 

**The Palestinian Territories and Lebanon**

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.68, 'Israel': 0.27, 'Jordan': 0.03, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Hawar News Agency ([https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties](https://hawarnews.com/en/clashes-with-israeli-army-in-daraa-leave-casualties)) reported on clashes between the Israeli army and armed individuals in Daraa, southern Syria, in April 2025, with operations in the Tasil area. FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) also reported on Israeli military operations in the Tasil area near Nawa, Syria, in April 2025, with the Israeli military stating they were conducting operations in the Tasil area, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure".

Syria Weekly ([https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation](https://www.syriaweekly.com/p/rocket-attack-triggers-israeli-retaliation)) discussed Israeli retaliatory artillery strikes in western Daraa, including areas near Tasil, in June 2025. <image:42>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could depict Israeli military forces. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Furthermore, web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria. However, the provided evidence does not confirm that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot. The web search results mention operations in Tasil, but do not provide any visual confirmation.

The claim's date of February 2025 is not directly supported by the evidence, which mentions events in April and June 2025.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported but not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the image's specific context, including the exact date and the nature of the military activity depicted.

The image search results provide additional context.

The search results include images of Israeli soldiers and military vehicles, but none of them match the original image.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025)) mentions rocket attacks from Tasil in June 2025 and that the IDF briefly operated in Tasil in April 2025. The ISW also notes that they ended daily maps of Israeli ground operations in February 2025. <image:9760>, <image:9761>, <image:9762>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli military operations occurred in Tasil, Daraa. However, the provided sources do not confirm the claim that the image depicts Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The ISW mentions that they ended daily maps of Israeli ground operations in February 2025. The Security Council Report and ISW mention operations in April and June 2025.

The claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The image's geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, but do not provide visual confirmation of the specific event described in the claim. The search results do not confirm the image's context, including the exact date and the nature of the military activity depicted. The claim is therefore not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While the image's geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine or Israel, and web searches confirm Israeli military operations in the Tasil area of Daraa, Syria, the evidence does not provide visual confirmation of the specific event described in the claim, i.e., Israeli forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025. The Institute for the Study of War ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-june-4-2025)) mentions that they ended daily maps of Israeli ground operations in February 2025.

A new study debunks claims that a magnitude 4.5 earthquake in Iran was a covert nuclear weapons test, as widely alleged on social media and some mainstream news outlets in October 2024, a period of heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Led by Johns Hopkins University scientists, the study warns about the potential consequences of mishandling and misinterpreting scientific information, particularly during periods of international conflict. The findings appear in the journal _[Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/article/view/1512)
_.

###### Key Takeaways

*   Seismic data shows a natural fault-driven event, not a covert nuclear test, caused an October 2024 earthquake in Iran.
*   False nuclear test claims hit social media just minutes after the earthquake, escalating with misused data and links to unrelated events.
*   English-language media outlets, especially in India, fueled the misinformation, while Persian-language media largely got the science right.

"There was a concerted misinformation and disinformation campaign around this event that promoted the idea this was a nuclear test, which is not something you often see happen with an earthquake," said [Benjamin Fernando](https://eps.jhu.edu/directory/benjamin/)
, a Johns Hopkins seismologist who led the study. The 2015 event shares a nearly identical seismic pattern with the 2024 earthquake. 5 earthquake, along with two similar events identified by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which monitors nuclear tests worldwide, reported that earthquakes with similar characteristics and magnitudes occurred in the same region in 2015 and 2018—both unrelated to nuclear activity.

Despite the clear scientific evidence of natural seismic activity, claims that the earthquake was a nuclear test began spreading rapidly on social media just 17 minutes after the event. Over the following hours, misinformation escalated, with some posts citing seismic data from an entirely different earthquake in Armenia earlier that day to substantiate the nuclear test narrative.

The misinformation gained traction as conspiracy theories linked the Iranian earthquake to a supposed seismic event in Israel the same evening. The researchers also identified media reports from the United States, Israel, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, France, and the United Kingdom.

In contrast, Persian-language media generally described the event accurately as a natural earthquake. Geological Survey."

While underground nuclear tests can produce seismic activity, the specifics of this event raise questions. At around 10:45 PM local time, the tremors were felt as far away as Tehran, approximately 110 km from the epicentre, according to the US Geological Survey.

Just minutes after the initial quake, a second, weaker tremor was reported in Israel around midnight, further fuelling concerns and theories about the nature of these seismic events. No country will mess with a nuclear power.”

Since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, the Jewish state's airstrikes have killed over 42,000 Palestinians and internally displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza. Despite the growing humanitarian crisis, the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, with support from the United States, shows no signs of reducing its military actions.

An excavator removes a charred car in Kiryat Bialik in the Haifa district of Israel following a Hezbollah attack \[Jack Guez/AFP\]

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)
 on Hezbollah that it never imagined," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a [video statement](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1837815933340971071)
 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)
."

Hezbollah last week [blamed](https://www.politico.eu/article/lebanon-hezbollah-injured-by-exploding-pagers/)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. The Jerusalem Post also included a photograph of the airbase. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim. More information is needed to verify if the image depicts the actual attack.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Content: The Institute for the Study of War and Critical Threats Project published a map showing the attacks into Northern Israel from Lebanon on September 22, 2024, including a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. <image:9835>


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides a map of the attacks on September 22, 2024, which includes a three-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF airbase near Haifa. However, the evidence still does not confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the image in the claim is not confirmed by the evidence. The CNN image shows damage from the attacks, but it is not of the airbase. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is about an image of the Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase allegedly attacked by Hezbollah on September 22, 2024. While multiple sources confirm that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the airbase on that date, and some sources provide images and drone footage of the airbase, none of the evidence confirms that the image in the claim is authentic. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

Why did Barcelona reverse its decision to cut ties with Israel?
===============================================================

In-depth: In February, Barcelona broke off ties with Israel, citing the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights. Seven months later, and with a new mayor in office, the twin city agreement with Tel Aviv has been restored.

On 1 September, the new mayor of the city of Barcelona - Jaume Collboni - signed a decree suspending a [decision by the previous administration](https://www.newarab.com/news/barcelona-cuts-ties-israel-over-palestinian-rights)
 to halt a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and cut ties with Israel.

The initial decision in February to suspend relations represented a huge milestone for solidarity with Palestine from [city councils](https://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-local-politics-europe-driving-change-palestine)
 around the world.

After progressive Mayor Ada Colau declared it would cease cooperation with Israel and support Palestinians, other cities joined the call, such as the [Belgian city of Liege](https://www.brusselstimes.com/475641/city-of-liege-votes-to-boycott-the-state-of-israel)
 in April and [Brazil’s Belem](https://www.newarab.com/news/brazilian-mayor-declares-city-apartheid-free-zone)
 in May.

The move came after a campaign by more than a hundred civil society associations which, a few months after being launched, had not just reached but [surpassed](https://twitter.com/proucomplicitat/status/1603728347774816256)
 the number of signatures they needed for the request to be presented to the city council. 

After being approved, a [letter signed by dozens of prominent figures](https://www.lavanguardia.com/local/barcelona/20230214/8755440/cuatro-premios-nobel-medio-centenar-personalidades-internacionales-apoyan-ruptura-barcelona-israel-colau-tel-aviv.html)
, including four Nobel Prize winners and musicians, actors, and intellectuals from around the globe, praised the decision.

But just seven months on and following a contested May election campaign which saw the leader of the centre-left Socialist Party Jaume Collboni obtain a majority in the city council, the tide has turned.

**Legal harassment against institutions and activists**

On the same day that Ada Colau announced the temporary suspension of Barcelona’s twinning agreement with Tel Aviv and its ties to the state, the pro-Israel group ACOM - Action and Communication for the Middle East - [announced](https://a-com.es/acom-anuncia-acciones-legales-contra-ada-colau-y-el-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona-por-su-discriminacion-antisemita/)
 it would take legal measures against the mayoralty’s alleged “hate agenda and its unhealthy obsession against Jews and their state”. 

ACOM, founded in 2004, is the largest of a series of groups that claim their objective is to fight “discrimination against Jews and harassment towards Israel and its citizens”.

Although [self-defined](https://a-com.es/dossier/)
 as a secular and independent entity – reportedly supported by the help of civil society and private donors – the organisation is part of an umbrella of international [pro-Israel groups](https://a-com.es/somos-acom/)
 ranging from MEMRI, the Israeli Allies Foundation, and other influential groups in the United States and beyond.

“ACOM has engaged in intimidating activists and city councils since the Spanish Solidarity Network Against the Occupation of Palestine launched its Apartheid Free Spaces campaign back in 2015,” a Spanish activist and academic who requested anonymity due to a history of reprisals by these groups told _The New Arab_.

As ACOM details in its [press releases](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
, legal actions by the group have resulted in the annulation of 86 institutional agreements in solidarity with Palestine, and in 2016, ACOM’s sister association sought the prosecution of [eight activists](https://law4palestine.org/spain-acquits-8-bds-activists-of-hate-crimes-against-us-jewish-singer-matisyahu/)
 that called for the boycott of Jewish-American reggae artist Matisyahu at the Rototom Sunspalsh Festival, accused by a local BDS group of supporting Israel’s occupation.

In Barcelona, these groups carried out a huge legal campaign against the former mayor and her team, referring complaints to the [administrative courts](https://a-com.es/acom-presenta-recurso-legal-contra-ayuntamiento-de-barcelona/)
 and launching criminal proceedings for alleged hate crimes.

Marc Serra, a councillor in Barcelona’s city council and part of Ada Colau’s party ‘Barcelona En Comú’, told _The New Arab_ that despite the first complaint being filed, these groups have tried to use different legal pathways to achieve their objective.

“There is a pattern in which they file complaints in the courts, in the public prosecutor's office, in the national audience… until they find a judge who ends up agreeing with them or at least opens a way to investigate”.

As a lawyer himself, Serra claims that “we can talk about it as an abuse of the judicial system”. He adds that “what they have achieved is what they were looking for, the opening of criminal proceedings against the Mayor of Barcelona, who took a stand against apartheid towards the Palestinian people, as well as questioning any authority that could take a similar stand”.

**The Socialist Party and renewing ties**

For new Mayor Jaume Collboni and his team, the decision to renew Barcelona’s ties with Israel was not economically driven nor influenced by any interest group, according to officials.

Pau Solanilla, city promotion commissioner under Collboni’s administration and the person who announced the move, told _The New Arab_ that “there has been no pressure or encouragement because it was not necessary, we have been clear that dialogue, cooperation and city diplomacy are useful instruments to contribute to peace in the region”. 

On the same day that Ada Colau broke ties, Jaume Collboni [visited Barcelona’s synagogue](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barcelona/20230215/maragall-llama-jaume-ii-provocador-83017210)
 to declare that, were he to be elected Mayor, he would reverse Colau’s decision. Yet, only two months later, the facts speak for themselves,” they said.

A man with a Palestinian flag pictured during a protest in Barcelona in 2015. “I think it is a very serious thing that these associations are using the discourse on human rights and the fight against discrimination after having ties with the extreme right, which is the one that goes against fundamental rights”.

In his official X account, and on behalf of his party, the city councillor also [reminded the Spanish public](https://twitter.com/MarcSerraSole/status/1697649555452440667)
 of the dangers to fundamental rights within Israel itself.

“Collboni has decided to "embrace" Israel when the state is going through its worst democratic crisis: governed by the far right, with a judicial reform that undermines the separation of powers and an increase in violence against the Palestinian population,” he wrote.

> "The signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona's recent decision is that 'everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians'"

**Impunity for Israel's occupation**

For Pau Solanilla, who speaks for his party’s recent decision to renew ties, the composition of Israel’s far-right government is concerning. They added that, “these crumbs do not provide a political solution to the Palestinian cause".

Israeli forces have killed at least [219 Palestinians](https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties)
 since the beginning of 2023 in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip, making it the deadliest year since the UN began recording deaths in 2005.

For Laurent Cohen, a Jewish member of the Catalan Association of Jews and Palestinians, the signal being sent to Israel following Barcelona’s recent decision is that “everything is fine, and that there will be no retaliation for the daily and repeated violations against the Palestinians”. 

**Bianca Carrera is a freelance writer and analyst specialising in Middle Eastern and North African politics, as well as environmental matters, at Sciences Po Paris. Some days later, the party also headed a [proposal to re-establish ties](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ca/mandat-2019-2023/accio-de-govern/el-consell-municipal/acords-del-plenari/35184)
 in a council plenary session. He made clear that the move was on his agenda, but associations claim they were not told it would be a priority within his mandate. 

The group that was behind Barcelona’s solidarity campaign with Palestine, ‘Prou Complicitat’, or ‘Enough Complicity’, told _The New Arab_ that Collboni’s Socialist Party later met with the Palestine solidarity movement.

“In this meeting, they acknowledged that their reaction to the suspension was hasty and that they overreacted. \[Getty\]

**Pro-Israel interest groups and the Spanish right**

ACOM was founded in 2004 by businessman David Hatchwell, and is now presided over by the CEO of the international insurance company AmTrust Europe, Angel Mas."

Following the end of Barcelona's twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv earlier in February by Mayor Ada Colau, the Spanish soccer team FC Barcelona sent a statement of support for Israel on Thursday.

The president of the Barcelona football club, Joan Laporte, decided to convey a message of support for Israel after Colau cited claims that Israel was guilty of “[apartheid](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1674201215-barcelona-to-vote-on-severing-ties-with-tel-aviv-over-israeli-apartheid")
" as well as “flagrant and systematic violation of human rights.” The choice was made less than a year after [Barcelona's](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv "https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/1675943226-barcelona-s-mayor-against-twinning-her-city-with-tel-aviv")
 twinning program with St. Petersburg was stopped in opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Laporte invited the representatives of the Israeli Embassy in Spain to the soccer match against the Manchester United team as part of the European League and to give the embassy representatives Barcelona shirts.

 left-wing Colau’s decision, with only her party voting in support.

On Thursday, the president of FC Barcelona invited representatives from Israel’s embassy to Spain to the soccer match against England’s Manchester United, in a sign of support for the Jewish state, according to a statement from the Israeli mission.

The statement said Joan Laporta stressed during a ceremony before the game that his team — which is popular among many Israelis — has long been committed to having good ties with Israel.

“The gesture of the Barcelona soccer team joins the wave of protests in Barcelona, Catalonia and all of Spain against the mayor’s decision,” the embassy said.

MADRID — The Spanish government on Friday criticized a decision by Barcelona’s mayor to cut the city’s ties with Israel, calling it a “unilateral move” that would not bring “anything good.”

In a letter last week to Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, Barcelona’s leftist mayor Ada Colau said she had taken the step due to Israel’s “systemic violation” of the rights of the Palestinian population.

Colau, a former anti-eviction activist, cited several Israeli policies including its construction of settlements on lands claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.

“It would be a severe mistake to apply a policy of double standards and turn a blind eye to a violation that has been, for decades, widely verified and documented by international organizations,” she added.

The largely symbolic measure, which had been requested by dozens of local groups, includes the end of a twinning agreement with Tel Aviv.

Speaking at an event in Barcelona on Friday, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called the move a “unilateral decision, and I understand an almost personal decision, by the mayor.”

“I believe that Barcelona’s vocation is to be an open city, as Spain is,” he added.

“I do not believe that anything good is achieved by suspending, cutting, expelling, nor is a dialogue built between Israel and Palestine,” he added.

After Colau announced last week she was suspending the twinning agreement, Madrid’s conservative Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida accused her of antisemitism and tweeted that he has written to Tel Aviv’s Mayor Ron Huldai to share “Madrid’s commitment to democracy and freedom.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with Israeli diplomats holding an Israeli flag. This event occurred on February 16, 2023, as reported by multiple sources, including The Jerusalem Post and i24NEWS. The claim that the image was taken in September 2024 is therefore incorrect. The evidence also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, but it does not specify the exact dates of the conflict.

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)

).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:9878>](https://komonews.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X."

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. In your opinion, if it turns out that there is basis for the suspicion against the suspects, in which way should they be handled?” 

Only 21% of Jewish Israelis answered that “they should stand criminal trial”; 14% of Jewish Israelis didn’t know.  

It is now clear, that the torture of Palestinians in this network of torture camps is systemic, as also documented by B’tselem in their report “[Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps](https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20240805_welcome_to_hell)
.” High brass is involved in this, so the idea that the gang rapists would be disciplined by their own commanders is tantamount to letting them off the hook. There is almost nothing they can do to Palestinians that the Jewish Israeli public would consider criminal, and hardly any Israelis would consider them “human animals” for thinking like that. 

_Correction: The story originally incorrectly said that “28% of Jewish Israelis answered that ‘they should stand criminal trial.'” The correct percentage is 21%. The story has been updated._

Netanyahu says attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon ‘not the end of the story’
=========================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

Israeli air raids on rocket sites are part of dangerous rise in hostilities, increasing fears a major conflict could erupt

Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli air raids targeting Hezbollah rockets in southern Lebanon in the early hours of Sunday morning were “not the end of the story”, after the two sides [exchanged their heaviest fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-hezbollah-attacks-what-we-know-so-far)
 since the war in Gaza began, raising fears of an all-out regional conflict.

The Israeli prime minister did not specify what further action, if any, was planned after the intense exchanges but he suggested Israel’s moves would be aimed at “changing the situation in the north”.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used 100 jet fighters that [hit more than 40 target sites inside Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/israel-pre-emptive-strikes-lebanon-huge-hezbollah-drone-and-rocket-attack)
 in sorties over [a period of seven hours](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/25/south-lebanon-reels-from-israel-aerial-barrage-hezbollah)
. He also discussed the UK’s important role in maintaining regional stability, and in this regard emphasised the importance of preventing regional escalation.”

----------- Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel.

According to Netanyahu, the raids “destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were designed to attack our citizens and our forces in the Galilee” in northern Israel.

He also said the IDF had “intercepted all of the drones that [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched at a strategic target in the centre of the country”.

Netanyahu did not name the target but the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, described it as “a military intelligence base 110km inside Israeli territory” just outside Tel Aviv, an apparent reference to the Glilot military base, home to the Mossad spy agency and military intelligence agencies such as the Unit 8200 electronic surveillance section.

Two [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 fighters and a militant from an allied group were killed in the strikes on Lebanon. “And I reiterate – this is not the end of the story.”

Military observers in Israel believe that some IDF generals and the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, are in favour of further sorties against Hezbollah military positions following Sunday’s apparent success.

Gallant told IDF officers that Hezbollah had been thrown off balance by pre-emptive Israeli action minutes before the Lebanese militia was due to launch its rocket and drone attack.

“We have destabilized Hezbollah, and their operation failed,” he said, according to [Haaretz newspaper](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-25/ty-article-live/idf-launches-wave-of-lebanon-strikes-as-israel-braces-for-major-hezbollah-escalation/00000191-8715-d632-add9-b7778aa50000?liveBlogItemId=373173373#373173373)
. He added that all the drones involved had been successfully launched and had entered Israeli airspace, but did not say how many, if any, had reached their intended target.

The Hezbollah secretary general claimed the Lebanese Shia militia had decided not to respond to the [killing in late July of its commander](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/30/beirut-suburbs-hit-in-airstrike-targeting-hezbollah-commander-israel-says)
, Fuad Shukr, with attacks on Israeli civilians or infrastructure but to focus on exclusively military targets.

He added that Hezbollah’s arsenal of guided missiles had not been used and had not been damaged by Israeli airstrikes, so could be used in the future. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, also stressed his country did not want an all-out conflict, though it would “act according to developments on the ground”.

However, Netanyahu’s government is under persistent political pressure to create conditions in northern Israel for 80,000 displaced residents to return to their homes. They had been driven out by Hezbollah rocket and artillery fire in solidarity with Hamas, after the Palestinian militant group launched its surprise attack on Israel on 7 October last year.

“Nasrallah in Beirut and \[Iranian supreme leader\] Khamenei in Tehran need to know that this is an additional step in changing the situation in the north, and returning our residents securely to their homes,” Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Sunday. He argued that Israel was at a “strategic crossroads” between possible negotiated solutions to the conflict in Gaza and the confrontation with Hezbollah in [Lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon)
.

“We need to use the negotiations to bring about the release of hostages, and through the release of the hostages, also open the possibility of creating a resolution in the north, and later, to calm the region,” the defence minister said.

Meanwhile, Israel was “operating militarily and preparing as if we will not reach a resolution, and we are ready at any moment for war in the north, whatever may come”, Gallant said. The French press agency AFP quoted an unnamed US military official as saying that Washington had helped track incoming Hezbollah attacks but “was not involved in Israel’s pre-emptive strikes”.

Gallant’s office reported that the minister had talked by phone to the UK defence secretary, John Healey, to brief him on the pre-emptive airstrikes and the thwarted Hezbollah attack.

“Minister Gallant discussed the important cooperation with Britain in ensuring Israel’s security,” the ministry statement said. An Israeli navy officer was killed and two other service members injured on a patrol boat off the coast of northern Israel that was hit by shrapnel from an Iron Dome interceptor missile.

On Sunday evening the armed wing of Hamas said that it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv in response to what it said was the “Israeli massacres against civilians”.

The IDF said sirens sounded in Rishon LeTsiyon, about 15 miles south of Tel Aviv, but the rocket landed “in an open area”.

A Hamas official also said on Sunday evening that it rejected new Israeli conditions put forward in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 ceasefire talks, casting further doubt on the chances of a breakthrough in the latest US-backed effort."

Content: "(Ayal Margolin/Flash90)

Israel is “ready to support” Lebanon’s efforts to disarm Hezbollah and will implement a phased reduction of its military presence in Lebanon as a “reciprocal measure,” the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Monday.

If the Lebanese Armed Forces “take the necessary steps to implement the disarmament of Hezbollah, Israel will engage in reciprocal measures, including a phased reduction of IDF presence in coordination with the US-led security mechanism,” the statement reads.

“Israel stands ready to support Lebanon in its efforts to disarm Hezbollah and to work together towards a more secure and stable future for both nations,” it continued.

The comments issued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office come nine months after Israel and Lebanon reached a ceasefire deal following a year of cross-border fighting that escalated in September 2024 before the agreement was signed in November. On Monday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem reaffirmed the group’s refusal to disarm.

The Prime Minister’s Office statement praised leaders in Beirut for their “momentous decision,” calling the move “a crucial opportunity for Lebanon to reclaim its sovereignty and restore the authority of its state institutions, military, and governance—free from the influence of non-state actors.”

The statement came a day after top US envoy Tom Barrack, accompanied by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, reportedly met in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials to discuss Syria and Lebanon.

Barrack said in Beirut last week that [Israel should honor its commitments](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-envoy-israeli-withdrawal-from-lebanon-next-step-as-beirut-agrees-to-disarm-hezbollah/)
 under a November 2024 ceasefire, in light of Beirut’s decision to work toward Hezbollah’s disarmament.

“I think the Lebanese government has done their part. Israel has maintained a military presence in five key points in southern Lebanon and continues to strike Hezbollah targets in the country.

On Monday, alongside the comments from Netanyahu’s office, a Hezbollah operative was killed in an Israeli drone strike in the southern Lebanon town of Tebnine, the military said.

According to the IDF, the operative was involved in restoring Hezbollah military infrastructure in the nearby town of Beit Lif, which the IDF called a violation of the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. <image:9886>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250807__692M8AA__v1__HighRes__LebanonIsraelConflictHezbollahArms-1.jpg)

Supporters of Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group block the streets with burning tires as they rally in cars and motorbikes to protest the government’s endorsement of a plan to disarm it, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, early on August 8, 2025. The US also reportedly pressed Israel to consider withdrawing from one of five outposts the IDF has established inside Lebanon.

Under the November 2024 truce agreement, weapons in Lebanon were to be held only by the state, and Israel was to fully withdraw its troops from the country; however, Israel has remained in those five outposts, and Hezbollah has refused to disarm.

In his Monday speech, Qassem said that the Lebanese government must first ensure Israel complies with the November ceasefire before talks on a national defense strategy can take place. Sign in to stop seeing this](//crm.timesofisrael.com/sign-in)

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam this month approved the objectives of a US proposal to disarm Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group that is also a political party in Lebanon, by the end of this year. Hezbollah, which was heavily weakened by the war, has vowed to resist such efforts."

Israel and Hezbollah exchange heavy fire in 'major escalation' of fighting

The intensity of cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel has lessened after a spectacular exchange of attacks on August 25.

But after an eventful week in Israel, where news of six executed Israeli captives led to massive protests against Netanyahu’s government, there is a question among analysts over whether the prime minister could intensify on other fronts as a distraction.

“We’re going to exact a heavy price from Hamas; I’m not going to tell you what the price is going to be and what we’re going to do; there’s going to be an element of surprise here,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a media conference on Monday.

But other than demanding a permanent Israeli presence in the Philadelphi Corridor bordering Egypt’s Sinai, thereby ensuring that Gaza ceasefire negotiations remain paralysed, Netanyahu has given little indication of what direction he will take.

What also remains to be seen is whether Hezbollah has drawn a line in the sand and demonstrated enough deterrent power to discourage Israel from looking towards it as a likely distraction.

The buildup
-----------

Hezbollah began intensifying attacks on Israel on October 8, a day after Israel launched what it said was a retaliatory war on Gaza following a Hamas-led attack on Israel during which 1,139 people were killed and some 240 taken captive.

Tensions built up, reaching a boiling point.

On July 31, [Israel struck a building in Beirut’s southern suburbs](/news/2024/7/30/israel-strikes-beirut-what-we-know-so-far)
. Hezbollah denied responsibility for the attack.

Shukr was the most high profile, but not the first, senior Hezbollah commander Israel assassinated in Lebanon.

On January 8, Israel killed Wissam al-Tawil, a commander in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, in Majdal Selem, just six days after it killed Saleh al-Arouri, a senior official in Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, in Beirut’s southern suburbs.

After Shukr’s assassination, cross-border attacks intensified as Hezbollah promised to avenge their fallen comrade.

In the early morning of August 25, Israel launched what it said was a preemptive attack on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, using 100 jets to hit thousands of Hezbollah launch sites.

At least 15 Lebanese towns were hit in the widest Israeli attack on Hezbollah since October 8.

Hezbollah launched its own attack the same morning, with Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah saying 340 rockets were fired into Israel, targeting 11 military and intelligence locations and hitting the Glilot military base, less than a mile (1.6km) from Tel Aviv.

Hezbollah released a statement that this “first phase” of retaliation was successfully completed.

Netanyahu rejected Nasrallah’s claim, saying Glilot was not hit.

Renewed deterrence?
-------------------

Hezbollah has repeatedly said its fight with Israel is connected to Gaza and that it will stop once a ceasefire is achieved.

Some, however, have treated it as a separate conflict, with some Western diplomats [reportedly working for months](/news/2024/6/25/pentagon-chief-calls-for-urgent-diplomacy-to-avoid-israel-hezbollah-war)
 to avoid a wider war in Lebanon.

The latest attack aimed to re-establish a level of deterrence to sway Israel from attacking top Hezbollah leaders, particularly in cities like Beirut, analysts said.

“Hezbollah has indeed re-established a significant level of deterrence following its massive retaliation campaign to avenge Fuad Shukr’s assassination,” Imad Salamey, a political analyst at the Lebanese American University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.

“This refutes Israel’s claims of having substantially reduced Hezbollah’s capabilities and clearly shows that Hezbollah maintains firm command and control despite Israel’s 10-month-long, very expensive military campaign aimed at weakening the party,” Salamey added.

Regardless of the results of Sunday’s exchange, analysts told Al Jazeera, a certain steadiness has returned to a conflict that had [threatened to spiral out of control](/news/2024/8/5/lebanese-grapple-with-fear-rage-and-tough-choices-as-regional-war-looms)
 and [draw in players](/news/2024/6/26/hezbollahs-axis-of-resistance-allies-waiting-in-reserve-to-fight-israel)
 from the region and beyond.

Reuters reported that Israel and Hezbollah told each other that neither wants further escalation. Analysts also seem to believe the tension has eased, at least temporarily.

“For Lebanon, the party’s \[Hezbollah\] attack has returned things to what they were before the assassination of Fuad Shukr,” Qassem Kassir, a political analyst believed to be close to Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera.

“I view \[this latest exchange\] mostly as a US-orchestrated attempt at turning \[the page\] and preventing escalation,” Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at Saint Joseph’s University in Beirut, said.

“Israel will probably continue to strike certain targets in Lebanon but I doubt that in the near future they will go after a major figure like Fuad Shukr.”

Period of calm
--------------

The prospect of an expanded war in Lebanon seemed to have been tabled right after August 25, but given the internal turbulence in Israel, it remains to be seen if the conflict will flare up again.

Israel has killed more than 560 people in Lebanon since October 8, more than 130 of them civilians. On the Israeli side, about 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have died due to attacks coming from Lebanon.

Tens of thousands are displaced on either side of the border, while the Israelis have reportedly tried to establish [a buffer zone](/features/longform/2024/3/25/israels-toxic-legacy-bombing-southern-lebanon-with-white-phosphorus)
 in south Lebanon by attempting to make the land uninhabitable and impossible to cultivate.

While many have expressed fatigue over the continuing conflict, its end is still not quite in sight.

“Any miscalculation \[from Israel\] could trigger an extremely expensive and protracted military retaliation campaign, which is proving very costly for Israel on multiple levels, both militarily and politically,” Salamey said.

“The demonstrated resilience and readiness of Hezbollah mean that Israel must weigh the risks more cautiously before engaging in further escalations.”

Many in Lebanon, Israel and beyond who fear a wider war might be breathing a temporary sigh of relief, but the storm has yet to completely pass.

“Escalation is still possible,” Kassir said. Five people were killed – two children, two women, and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.

Israel said Shukr was responsible for an attack on Majdal Shams in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights that killed 12 children."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, discussing the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, including a video of Benjamin Netanyahu (<image:9882>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 6, 2024, discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024, and includes the image of Netanyahu's office (<image:56>).

The Times of Israel published an article discussing the disarmament of Hezbollah and the Israeli military presence in Lebanon, mentioning a ceasefire deal signed in November 2024, and includes images of Hezbollah supporters (<image:9886>) and US envoy Tom Barrack (<image:9885>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office (<image:56>) was published by Al Jazeera in an article discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024. The evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image does show Netanyahu's office and was published in August 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Additional information is needed to verify whether Hezbollah captured and published the image.

A spokesperson for Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed to media outlets on Monday for the first time that Israel was behind a string of devastating attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.

During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu reportedly boasted that Israel was behind the attacks, but while the Jewish state was widely believed to have been responsible, there had been no official confirmation from the government or military until spokesman Omer Dostri’s statement on Monday.

[On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded](https://www-timesofisrael-com.translate.goog/several-killed-thousands-hurt-as-wave-of-pager-explosions-strikes-hezbollah/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=es&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=tc)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.

The coordinated attack dealt a deadly blow to the Iran-backed Lebanese terror group, and kicked off an escalation that continued with the assassination of almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and a limited Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the incident was the “biggest security breach” for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.

Netanyahu reportedly claimed to cabinet ministers on Sunday that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation.

“The pager operation and the elimination of \[Hezbollah leader Hassan\] Nasrallah were carried out despite the opposition of senior officials in the defense establishment and those responsible for them in the political echelon,” he reportedly said, in a clear dig at recently fired defense minister Yoav Gallant.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Hezbollah Benjamin Netanyahu office August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, discussing the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, including a video of Benjamin Netanyahu (<image:9882>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 6, 2024, discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024, and includes the image of Netanyahu's office (<image:56>).

The Times of Israel published an article discussing the disarmament of Hezbollah and the Israeli military presence in Lebanon, mentioning a ceasefire deal signed in November 2024, and includes images of Hezbollah supporters (<image:9886>) and US envoy Tom Barrack (<image:9885>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office (<image:56>) was published by Al Jazeera in an article discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024. The evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image does show Netanyahu's office and was published in August 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Additional information is needed to verify whether Hezbollah captured and published the image.


## Actions
```
image_search("Hezbollah Benjamin Netanyahu office")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of Benjamin Netanyahu in his office (<image:9888>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Netanyahu's office was published in August 2024 by Al Jazeera. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image. The image search did not provide any additional information to verify the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image does show Netanyahu's office and was published in August 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Additional information is still needed to verify whether Hezbollah captured and published the image.


## Actions
```
web_search("Hezbollah video Netanyahu office")
```

The military said it would intensify counter-terrorism operations in the West Bank and that it had blocked entry points in certain areas, without specifying where.

Claim: "<image:56> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office and was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Hezbollah Benjamin Netanyahu office August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2024, discussing the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, including a video of Benjamin Netanyahu (<image:9882>). Al Jazeera published an article on September 6, 2024, discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024, and includes the image of Netanyahu's office (<image:56>).

The Times of Israel published an article discussing the disarmament of Hezbollah and the Israeli military presence in Lebanon, mentioning a ceasefire deal signed in November 2024, and includes images of Hezbollah supporters (<image:9886>) and US envoy Tom Barrack (<image:9885>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image of Benjamin Netanyahu's office (<image:56>) was published by Al Jazeera in an article discussing the exchange of attacks between Hezbollah and Israel, including a major escalation on August 25, 2024. The evidence does not explicitly state that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The image does show Netanyahu's office and was published in August 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm that Hezbollah captured and published the image.

Additional information is needed to verify whether Hezbollah captured and published the image.

CNN  — 

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel."

Content: "<image:9901>!Reuters Palestinians inspect damage following an Israeli strike on Mustafa Hafez school, which was sheltering displaced people, in Gaza City, in the northern Gaza Strip (20 August 2024) <image:9902>Reuters

The UN condemned earlier this month what it called the “increasing frequency” of Israeli strikes on schools

At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says.

A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood.

The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians.

Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area.

The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed.

Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike.

The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building.

"We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion," witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency.

"The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble."

Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people.

He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel.

"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence," it added.

The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied.

Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the "increasing frequency" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them "with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities".

The warning after [at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no)
, according to the director of a local hospital.

The IDF said the school had "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 "terrorists" who were killed.

The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities.

The US secretary of state discussed the ceasefire talks with Egypt's president

Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah.

The IDF said its troops and aircraft had "eliminated numerous terrorists" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device.

It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation.

After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties.

But Hamas accused the US of "acquiescing" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's "new conditions".

! The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement.

A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.

He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war.

 Israeli forces responded with almost a year-long military assault on Gaza that has resulted in the killing of more than 41,000 Palestinians as of mid-September 2024, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, including more than 16,750 children, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reported.[\[14\]](#_ftn14)

 The World Health Organization estimates that more than 22,500 people of those injured as of July 23, 2024, have sustained “life-changing injuries,” requiring rehabilitation services “now and for years to come”.[\[18\]](#_ftn18)
 Save the Children reported in January that more than 10 children were losing one or both legs per day.[\[19\]](#_ftn19)
  

Since the October 7 attacks, Israeli authorities cut off essential services, including water and electricity, to Gaza and blocked the entry of all but a trickle of fuel and critical humanitarian aid, acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes.[\[20\]](#_ftn20)
 Israeli authorities have also been using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza, which constitutes a war crime.[\[21\]](#_ftn21)

Israeli forces continue to conduct numerous airstrikes and large-scale ground operations in the hostilities in Gaza with Palestinian armed groups.

Unique Risks for Children with Disabilities during Attacks, Evacuations, and Forcible Transfers
===============================================================================================

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of August 7, 1.9 million people were internally displaced, amounting to 90 percent of Gaza’s population.[\[174\]](#_ftn174)
 Civilians typically flee their homes during armed conflict to avoid fighting or reach safer areas, on the orders of a party to the conflict to evacuate for lawful security or military reasons, or because a party to the conflict unlawfully forcibly transfers them.[\[175\]](#_ftn175)
 Human Rights Watch previously documented the severe difficulties civilians with disabilities face when fleeing buildings that Israeli forces attacked during fighting between 2009 and 2014, as well as their need for help to reach safety.[\[176\]](#_ftn176)

Under the Fourth Geneva Convention applicable to occupied territory, a party to the conflict may not forcibly transfer the civilian population in whole or in part, unless required by the security of the civilians affected or for imperative military reasons.[\[177\]](#_ftn177)
 

Evacuations and the war crime of forced displacement disproportionately affect people with disabilities.[\[178\]](#_ftn178)
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, when international humanitarian law permits such evacuations, “all possible measures must be taken in order that the civilians concerned are received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and that members of the same family are not separated.” [\[179\]](#_ftn179)
 In this regard, the specific needs of persons with disabilities must be taken into account when evaluating what is satisfactory from their perspective.”

The CRPD requires governments to take “all necessary measures” to ensure the safety and protection of people with disabilities, such as by providing necessary transportation and accommodation. The challenges faced by Ghazal highlight some of the unique risks faced by children with disabilities in Gaza.

The actions by the Israeli military and the government’s blockade of Gaza, including severe restrictions on humanitarian aid, have inflicted profound trauma and suffering on Palestinian children, which has had a disproportionate impact on children with disabilities. The secretary-general noted reported but unverified grave violations against 3,900 Israeli children and 19,887 Palestinian children during 2023.

Guterres said, “I am appalled by the dramatic increase and unprecedented scale and intensity of grave violations against children in the Gaza Strip, Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, despite my repeated calls for parties to implement measures to end grave violations.” He “urge\[d\] all parties to the conflict to immediately end and prevent grave violations against children … and to adopt immediately clear, time-bound commitments to end and prevent grave violations against children, as proposed by the United Nations, and to comply with international humanitarian law and international human rights law.”[\[33\]](#_ftn33)

Save the Children reported in June that up to 21,000 children were estimated to be missing, including many dead under rubble, detained, buried in unmarked graves, or separated from their families.[\[34\]](#_ftn34)
 The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reported in mid-September the “outrageously high number of children in Gaza who continue to be killed, maimed, injured, missing, displaced, orphaned and subjected to famine, malnutrition and disease,“ citing Israel‘s “attacks on Gaza using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas and its denial of humanitarian access,“ which has displaced at least 1 million children and pushed 3,500 children to risk death from malnutrition.[\[35\]](#_ftn35)

While the Israeli government has repeatedly stated that its war aims are to destroy Hamas and to free the hostages taken during the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7, several statements by Israeli officials, indicate an intent to inflict harm on the civilian population, including children.  

Family members told Human Rights Watch about injuries sustained by their children from Israeli forces’ use of explosive weapons.[\[51\]](#_ftn51)

This would entail, among other things, ensuring people with disabilities have access to the means necessary for their survival, including food, water, medication, health care, and assistive devices, all of which have mostly been absent in Gaza due to the blockade.

Impact of Starvation as a Method of Warfare on Children with Disabilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Israeli forces have been using starvation of the civilian population as a method of warfare.[\[208\]](#_ftn208)

In March UNICEF reported that 31 percent children under 2 in northern Gaza “suffer from acute malnutrition” and that 4.5 percent of children in the north suffer from “severe wasting,” the most life-threatening form of malnutrition.[\[209\]](#_ftn209)
 Also, in March, WHO officials reported “children dying of starvation” in both Kamal Adwan and al Awda hospitals in northern Gaza.[\[210\]](#_ftn210)
 On April 3, Oxfam said people in northern Gaza have been forced to survive on an average of 245 calories a day, “less than a can of fava beans,” since January.[\[211\]](#_ftn211)
 

Save the Children confirmed that 27 children died from starvation and disease in April.[\[212\]](#_ftn212)
 As of September 16, 38 Palestinians, the majority being children, have died of malnutrition and dehydration in hospitals, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.[\[213\]](#_ftn213)
 Also in June, the WHO stated that 8,000 children under 5 have been diagnosed and treated for acute malnutrition, including 1,600 children with severe acute malnutrition.[\[214\]](#_ftn214)
 UNRWA stated that more than 50,000 children of all ages required treatment for acute malnutrition.[\[215\]](#_ftn215)
 According to the WHO, only two stabilization centers for severely malnourished patients were able to operate because of insecurity and lack of access.[\[216\]](#_ftn216)

While there is no official data on the number of children with disabilities among the children who have died or are acutely malnourished, existing research demonstrates that children with disabilities are in general at a higher risk of malnutrition.[\[217\]](#_ftn217)

In March, Reuters news agency reported finding 10 seriously malnourished children—including Isra, a 5-year-old girl who has quadriplegia and epilepsy—during a visit to al-Awda Health Centre, Rafah.[\[218\]](#_ftn218)
 Photographs and videos showing signs of acute malnourishment in Fadi al-Zant, a 6-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis, lying in a bed at Kamal Adwan Hospital, northern Gaza, were posted on social media and by Reuters and other media outlets in mid-March.[\[219\]](#_ftn219)
 Media outlets and social media have also reported that several children with disabilities have died from starvation-related complications, including malnutrition and dehydration, including Yazan al-Kafarna, 12, who had cerebral palsy and died on March 4.[\[220\]](#_ftn220)

As of September 18, ongoing Israeli strikes and ground operations have killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, including more than 16,750 children according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. Previously, the Palestinian Civil Defense estimated more than 10,000 adults and children were missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes and ground attacks on Gaza, and resistance by Palestinian armed groups, including rocket strikes on Israel, have continued since then. “I would buy it regardless of the cost if I could just find it.”

The International Court of Justice, in its July 19, 2024 Advisory Opinion on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, held that the law of occupation still applies to Israel’s conduct in Gaza."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza resulted in casualties, including children, in July and August 2024. The Human Rights Watch report indicates a high number of child fatalities by mid-September 2024. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child under rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike is plausible. However, the exact date and location within Gaza cannot be confirmed.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the specific date and location of the event depicted in the image.

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli airstrikes in Gaza resulted in casualties, including children, in July and August 2024. The Human Rights Watch report indicates a high number of child fatalities by mid-September 2024. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the evidence, the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child under rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike is plausible. However, the exact date and location within Gaza cannot be confirmed.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the specific date and location of the event depicted in the image.

Man pulled alive from Myanmar earthquake rubble after five days

Twenty-six-year-old rescued from hotel in Naypyidaw as agencies call for increased aid before monsoon

A man has been pulled alive from the rubble of a hotel in [Myanmar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar)
, five days after the country’s worst earthquake in a century flattened entire neighbourhoods and tore through temples, bridges and highways.

A joint team of rescuers from [Myanmar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar)
 and Turkey found the 26-year-old in the ruins of the building in the capital, Naypyidaw, after midnight, the fire service and the country’s ruling junta said.

The disaster has killed more than 2,700 people, and the death toll is expected to surpass 3,000 on Wednesday, according to Myanmar’s military ruler, Min Aung Hlaing. Humanitarian agencies urged other countries to increase aid before the monsoon rains.

Close to the epicentre, in the [devastated cities of Mandalay](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/a-hospital-collapsed-right-in-front-of-me-myanmar-reels-after-earthquake)
 and Sagaing, traumatised survivors slept in the street, with the stench of corpses trapped under the rubble permeating the disaster zone. Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA

“The devastating impact of Friday’s earthquake is becoming clearer by the hour – this is a crisis on top of a crisis for Myanmar, where the humanitarian situation is already dire,” said Arif Noor, the Myanmar country director for the humanitarian agency Care.

“[Rescue teams are still recovering](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/29/myanmar-volunteers-dig-earthquake-victims)
 those trapped under the rubble, and hospitals are overwhelmed. “You cannot ask for aid with one hand and bomb with the other,” said Amnesty’s Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.

The junta has declared a week of national mourning, with flags to fly at half mast on official buildings until 6 April “in sympathy for the loss of life and damages”.

The junta said on Wednesday that it was declaring a temporary ceasefire until 22 April to facilitate relief efforts, a day after armed resistance groups opposed to military rule declared unilateral temporary ceasefires.

In its nightly news bulletin on Tuesday, the state-controlled MRTV quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying the military had halted its offensives but that unspecified minority ethnic armies were planning to exploit the disaster."

Rescue crews in Myanmar pulled a 26-year-old man out alive from the rubble of the capital city hotel where he worked early on Wednesday (April 2, 2025), but most teams were finding only bodies five days after a massive earthquake hit the country.

After using an endoscopic camera to pinpoint Naing Lin Tun's location in the rubble and confirm that he was alive, the man was gingerly pulled through a hole jackhammered through a floor and loaded on to a gurney nearly 108 hours after he was trapped in the hotel where he worked.

! One body was removed from the rubble early Wednesday (April 2, 2025), raising the death total in Bangkok to 22 with 34 injured, primarily at the construction site.

Myanmar has been wracked by civil war and the earthquake is making a dire humanitarian crisis even worse, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations.

#### Claims of an attack on a Chinese Red Cross convoy

The Three Brotherhood Alliance, one of a powerful group of militias that has taken a large swath of the country from the military, announced a unilateral one-month ceasefire on Tuesday (April 1, 2025) to facilitate the humanitarian response. State-run MRTV reported that the rescue in the city of Naypyitaw was carried out by a Turkish and local team and took more than nine hours.

[The 7.7 magnitude earthquake](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/myanmars-earthquake-death-toll-jumps-as-more-bodies-recovered-from-the-rubble/article69389350.ece)
 hit midday Friday (March 28, 2025), toppling thousands of buildings, collapsing bridges and buckling roads. While not mentioning the Red Cross, he said security forces had fired into the air to deter a convoy that refused to stop near Ohn Ma Tee village, the site of recent fighting with the TNLA.

Asked about he incident, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun did not comment on the attack, but said “relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China to Myanmar have arrived in Myanmar and are on the way to Mandalay,” adding that “rescue personnel and supplies are safe.”

China is incredibly economically important to Myanmar, and also one of the military's largest suppliers with weapons, along with Russia.

On Tuesday (April 1, 2025), Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the UN-backed Human Rights Council, said on X that military attacks must stop to facilitate aid.

“The focus in Myanmar must be on saving lives, not taking them,” he said.

! <image:9948>

#### Extent of devastation beyond major cities is still unclear

Most of the details so far have come from Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, which was near the epicentre of the earthquake, and the capital Naypyitaw, about 270 kilometres north of Mandalay.

Many areas are without power, telephone or cell connections, and difficult to reach by road, but more reports are beginning to trickle in.

In Singu township, about 65 kilometres north of Mandalay, 27 gold miners were killed were killed in a cave-in, the independent Democratic Voice of Burma reported.

In the area of Inle Lake, northeast of the capital, many people died when homes built on wooden stilts in the water collapsed in the earthquake, the government's official Global New Light of Myanmar reported without providing specific figures.

! So far, 2,886 people have been reported dead in Myanmar and another 4,639 injured, according to state television MRTV, but local reports suggest much higher figures.

The earthquake also rocked neighbouring Thailand, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok. The shadow opposition National Unity Government had already called a ceasefire for its forces.

! Most recently, an opposition militia belonging to the Brotherhood Alliance reported that the military fired on a relief convoy of nine Chinese Red Cross vehicles late Tuesday (April 1, 2025) on a road in the northern part of Shan state near Ohn Ma Tee village.

The Ta'ang National Liberation Army said the Chinese Red Cross was bringing supplies to Mandalay and had reported its route to the military.

But Major General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the military regime, told state-run MRTV that the convoy had not notified authorities of its route ahead of time. <image:9948>

#### More international aid heads to Myanmar

Countries have pledged millions in assistance to help Myanmar and humanitarian aid organisations with the monumental task ahead.

Australia on Wednesday (April 2, 2025) said it was providing another $4.5 million, in addition to $1.25 million it had already committed, and had a rapid response team on the ground.

India has flown in aid and sent two Navy ships with supplies as well as providing some 200 rescue workers. Agency for International Development arrived Tuesday (April 1, 2025) to determine how best to respond given limited US resources due to the slashing of the foreign aid budget and dismantling of the agency as an independent operation."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image's geolocation data suggests it was taken in Turkey. The search results show that the image could be related to an earthquake. The Guardian and The Hindu published articles about an earthquake in Myanmar in April 2025. The articles do not mention the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

The claim is also contradicted by the evidence, as the image is likely from Turkey, not Gaza. The evidence does not mention any Israeli bombing in July 2024.
