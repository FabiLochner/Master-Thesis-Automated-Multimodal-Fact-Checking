Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that on July 6, 2024, an Israeli attack on a UN-run school sheltering displaced people in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured over 75. <image:1>. The article mentions the attack occurred at al-Jaouni school. The Israeli army stated they struck "several terrorists" in the area. The article also mentions a previous attack in early June on an UN-linked school in Nuseirat refugee camp that killed at least 40 people. The article was published on July 6, 2024, by Al Jazeera Staff.

Useful result: From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/06/1150856): 
Content: The UN News article, published on June 9, 2024, discusses the aftermath of an Israeli military operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where over 270 people, including children, were killed. The article also mentions an Israeli attack on a UN school-turned shelter in the same area on June 6, 2024, which resulted in the deaths of dozens, including 14 children. <image:k>

The claim '<image:63> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed by Israel on July 6, 2024, is partially supported by evidence. While some sources, like Countercurrents.org ([https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/6/israeli-attack-on-un-school-used-as-shelter-in-gaza-kills-at-least-16)), support the claim, other sources, such as Palinfo, report the children were killed in October 2023.

So, the overall veracity is: false
