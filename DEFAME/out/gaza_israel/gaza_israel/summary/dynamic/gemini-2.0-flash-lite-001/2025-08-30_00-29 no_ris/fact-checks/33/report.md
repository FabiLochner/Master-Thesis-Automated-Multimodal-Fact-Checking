### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran in June 2025. One article from TRT Global ([https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3](https://trt.global/world/article/334e2e1ae7a3)) mentions economic losses for both countries, with US President Donald Trump brokering a ceasefire and a travel ban on Jewish citizens in Israel. Another article from Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/explainer-war-with-iran-financial-fallout-for-israel-us/3614218)) discusses the financial impact, including US involvement with strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, and estimates the cost of the US operation.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that an assassination plot against Donald Trump was orchestrated by two Jewish Americans. The search results mention assassination attempts, but they do not identify the perpetrators' religious affiliation.

The evidence does not directly support the claim that Israel wants war with Iran and wants American money and servicemen. However, the search results mention a conflict between Israel and Iran in June 2025, with US involvement, including financial costs. The evidence does not explicitly state Israel's intentions.

The claim is not supported by the evidence. More information is needed to verify the claim.

## Elaboration
The evidence now supports parts of the claim. The U.S. Justice Department charged three men in an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump and kill Jewish Americans. The evidence also indicates that Israel sought U.S. involvement in a military campaign against Iran, but the U.S. declined.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results did not support the claim. However, the subsequent searches revealed that the U.S. Justice Department charged three men in an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump and kill Jewish Americans. Additionally, Israel sought U.S. involvement in a military campaign against Iran, but the U.S. declined.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. While the initial search did not support the claim, subsequent searches revealed that the U.S. Justice Department charged three men in an Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump and kill Jewish Americans, and that Israel sought U.S. involvement in a military campaign against Iran, which the U.S. declined ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israel-asked-us-to-join-military-campaign-against-iran-but-us-rejects-request/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israel-asked-us-to-join-military-campaign-against-iran-but-us-rejects-request/)).
