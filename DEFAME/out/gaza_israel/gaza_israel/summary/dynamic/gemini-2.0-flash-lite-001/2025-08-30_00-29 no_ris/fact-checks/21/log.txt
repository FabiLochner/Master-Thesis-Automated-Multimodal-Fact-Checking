Useful result: From [Source](https://jcpa.org/the-u-s-should-permanently-stop-all-funding-to-unrwa/): 
Content: The search result from jcpa.org, published on July 30, 2025, states that President Trump signed Executive Order 14199 on February 4, 2025, "Withdrawing the United States From and Ending Funding to Certain United Nations Organizations." The article also mentions a Trump administration freeze on UNRWA funding in 2018.

The claim 'Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA is false. While Trump did sign executive orders on that date, and later signed an executive order (Executive Order 14199) on February 4, 2025, to end funding to certain United Nations Organizations, including UNRWA, the January 20th date is not supported by the evidence ([https://jcpa.org/the-u-s-should-permanently-stop-all-funding-to-unrwa/](https://jcpa.org/the-u-s-should-permanently-stop-all-funding-to-unrwa/)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
