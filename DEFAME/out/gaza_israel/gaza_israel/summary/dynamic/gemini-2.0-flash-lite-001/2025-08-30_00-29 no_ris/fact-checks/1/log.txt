Useful result: From [Source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017): 
Content: The search result from ScienceDirect discusses the March 28, 2025, Myanmar earthquake. The article is from the "Journal of Dynamic Disasters" and was published in June 2025. The earthquake was a Mw 7.7 event that struck central Myanmar along the Sagaing Fault. <image:9254>, <image:9255>

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. While the web search confirms the occurrence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, as stated in the claim, the geolocate tool suggests that the image was most likely taken in China, not Myanmar.

So, the overall veracity is: false
