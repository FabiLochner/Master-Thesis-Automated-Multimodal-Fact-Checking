## Actions
```

web_search("Benjamin Netanyahu house aerial view")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon)) reported that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea was hit by a drone on October 19, 2024, causing superficial damage. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel)) also reported the drone attack on the same date, with Hezbollah claiming responsibility.

CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/middleeast/video-netanyahu-beach-hezbollah-drone-attack-intl-hnk)) reported that Netanyahu's beach house in Caesarea was damaged in a drone strike on October 22, 2024, also claimed by Hezbollah. The article mentions that Netanyahu and his wife were not at home during the attack. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is partially accurate but contains inaccuracies. The image's location is likely in Israel, according to the geolocation results. However, the provided evidence indicates that the drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's house occurred in October 2024, not August 2024, as stated in the claim. Furthermore, the evidence specifies that the attack targeted Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, which is consistent with the image's potential location in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate as the image is likely of Netanyahu's house in Israel, and it was attacked by a drone. However, the date of the attack is incorrect. The attack happened in October 2024, not August 2024.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially false. While the image likely depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Israel, as suggested by the geolocation and the reports from sources like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), the drone attack occurred in October 2024, not August 2024, as stated in the claim.
