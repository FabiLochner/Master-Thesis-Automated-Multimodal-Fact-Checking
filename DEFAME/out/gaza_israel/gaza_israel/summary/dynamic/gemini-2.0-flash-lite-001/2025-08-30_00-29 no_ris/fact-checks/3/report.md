## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reported on February 23, 2025, that police in Pai district, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, found no evidence of Israeli influence, settlements, or business dominance, with 4,573 Israeli visitors as of February 19, and only 24 seeking to extend their stay. The Nation Thailand ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) published an article on February 18, 2025, refuting claims of a permanent Jewish community in Pai, clarifying that Israeli tourists visit legally, and mentioning the existence of a Chabad House.

Khaosod English ([https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) discussed fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai District into an occupied land, fueled by online disinformation and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. The article also mentions that the Israeli embassy in Bangkok urged Israeli tourists to respect local laws and culture. The article includes an image of a gathering of people, which is not related to the article (![image 4](media/3.jpg)).


### Evidence from `image_search`

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is not entirely accurate. While there were concerns and discussions about Israelis in Pai District, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, in February 2025, the evidence does not support the assertion that the image depicts Israelis who have stopped fighting wars and moved to become "settlers." The Bangkok Post and The Nation Thailand found no evidence of settlements or business dominance. The Khaosod English article discusses fears of Israelis turning Pai into an occupied land, but the image provided is not related to the article. The image search shows an image of Pai, Thailand, but does not confirm the claim.

The evidence indicates a presence of Israeli tourists in Pai, but there is no confirmation of them being "settlers" who have stopped fighting wars.

The claim's veracity is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement

While there were discussions about Israelis in Pai District, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, in February 2025, the evidence does not support the assertion that the image depicts Israelis who have stopped fighting wars and moved to become "settlers." The Bangkok Post and The Nation Thailand found no evidence of settlements or business dominance.

The image search shows an image of Pai, Thailand, but does not confirm the claim.
