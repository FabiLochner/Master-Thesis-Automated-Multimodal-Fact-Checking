Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on June 4, 2024, discussing the pressure on Keir Starmer to take stronger action against Israel regarding the situation in Gaza. <image:1023> shows protesters calling for the UK to sanction Israel. Starmer described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire. He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.

The claim 'UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The available evidence, including articles from [map.org.uk](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east), and the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o), indicates that Keir Starmer has commented on the conflict in Gaza, but does not support the claim that he announced a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
