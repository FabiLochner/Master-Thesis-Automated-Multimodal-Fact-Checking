The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially false. While the image likely depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Israel, as suggested by the geolocation and the reports from sources like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), the drone attack occurred in October 2024, not August 2024, as stated in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
