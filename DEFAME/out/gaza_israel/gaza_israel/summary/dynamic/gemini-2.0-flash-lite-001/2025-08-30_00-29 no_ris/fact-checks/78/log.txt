The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland. In fact, reports indicate that Netanyahu remained in Israel and was present at events following the attack, such as a memorial ceremony on October 7, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/).
