The claim '<image:37> This image shows thousands gathering at Sohrawardi Park in Kolkata, India, in April 2025 to show solidarity with the Palestinian people amid the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza.' is false.
Justification: The image shows a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India, as claimed. The protest, a "March for Gaza," was held on April 12, 2025, at Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to show solidarity with Palestinians. The event was organized by the Palestine Solidarity Movement and had approximately 100,000 participants. The photos were mistakenly shared by Palestinian media as being from Kolkata ([https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/)).
