Another article from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 ![image 9697](media/2025-08-30_01-09-1756516142-646464.jpg), and mentions that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. Le Monde diplomatique ([https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syrian and Israeli officials in early 2025. The Times of Israel article mentions talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025. The Le Monde diplomatique article mentions a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results reveal that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan prayed for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" according to a JINSA report ([https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). The report also mentions Erdogan's statements in January and February 2025 regarding Israel's actions in Syria. An Al Jazeera article ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reports that Turkey severed ties with Israel in August 2025. A Haaretz article ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)) discusses President Trump's involvement in the relationship between Syria and Israel.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that Erdogan made statements regarding Israel's actions in Syria in January and February 2025. On March 30, 2025, Erdogan prayed for Israel's destruction. The evidence does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there were discussions and actions involving Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in early 2025, including statements by Erdogan, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim. While there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in early 2025, including statements by Erdogan, there is no record of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results show Erdogan made statements regarding Israel's actions in Syria in January and February 2025, and on March 30, 2025, he prayed for Israel's destruction, but not that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.
