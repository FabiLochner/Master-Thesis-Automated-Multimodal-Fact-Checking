Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/13/france-asks-police-to-ban-pro-palestinian-protest-in-paris): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article about a pro-Palestinian protest in Paris. <image:9505> shows the Eiffel Tower in the background.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-court-upholds-government-instruction-ban-all-pro-palestine-protests-2023-10-18/): 
Content: Reuters published an article on October 18, 2023, about a French court upholding a government instruction to ban all pro-Palestine protests. The article includes an image of a pro-Palestine protest in France. <image:9506>

The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image likely depicts a pro-Palestine protest in France, as indicated by the presence of Palestinian flags and the geolocation results. While the 2024 French parliamentary elections did take place, with Marine Le Pen's party gaining a lead, the evidence does not support the claim that the image shows a riot against her victory. The image search results show pro-Palestine protests in France, not necessarily a riot against Le Pen's victory. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
