## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 25, 2024, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, according to articles from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago), [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html), and [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/). The CNN article mentions a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago on July 26, 2024, and the Tennessee Lookout article states that Trump welcomed Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago. The Voice of America article reports that Trump condemned pro-Hamas protests. None of the articles include the quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel." <image:k>, ![image 5352](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913004-996719.jpg), ![image 5354](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913008-261964.jpg), ![image 5357](media/2025-08-23_01-36-1755913017-893899.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024. However, the provided articles from CNN, Voice of America, and Tennessee Lookout do not include the quote "I hope that America obliterates Israel." Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, but none of the articles mention the specific quote attributed to him in the claim. The evidence suggests that the claim is false because the quote is not present in the available sources.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as confirmed by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/trump-netanyahu-meeting-mar-a-lago), [Voice of America](https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-trump-condemn-pro-hamas-protest-near-us-capitol/7713095.html), and [Tennessee Lookout](https://tennesseelookout.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), none of these sources contain the quote attributed to him.
