```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran and western Iran, confirmed by satellite imagery and geolocated footage. ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024)) ![image 6927](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501849-721809.jpg) CNN published an article discussing Israeli strikes in Iran. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk)) ![image 6928](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-121773.jpg)

Al Jazeera published an article about Israeli attacks on Iran, including an image of a damaged ambulance. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation)) ![image 6929](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-652723.jpg)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'China': 0.42, 'Malaysia': 0.32, 'Taiwan': 0.13, 'Singapore': 0.03, 'Australia': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Japan': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran and western Iran, confirmed by satellite imagery and geolocated footage ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024)). CNN and Al Jazeera also reported on the attacks ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation)).

The image search results confirm that the event occurred. However, the geolocation of the image suggests that it was most likely taken in China or Malaysia.

Therefore, while the claim that there were Israeli strikes on Iran on October 26, 2024, is supported by the evidence, the image's origin is questionable.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows an Israeli missile attack on Iran on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While the image search confirms that there were Israeli strikes on Iran on the specified date, the geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in China or Malaysia. Therefore, the image is likely misattributed. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported. While there is evidence of Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, as reported by the Institute for the Study of War ([https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024)), CNN, and Al Jazeera, the geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in China or Malaysia, making the image's attribution to the event questionable.
