Content: ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut Airport. <image:9227>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2006/7/14/israel-bombs-beirut-airport-again): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports on Israel bombing Beirut airport. <image:9228>

The claim '<image:10> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Israel has bombed Beirut Airport in the past, the image's geolocation data does not support the claim that it was taken in Lebanon, and the specified date of October 2024 is in the future. News sources like [ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-14/israel-planes-bomb-beirut-airport-for-fourth-time/1801960) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2006/7/14/israel-bombs-beirut-airport-again) reported on bombings in 2006, but the provided image's origin and the future date invalidate the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
