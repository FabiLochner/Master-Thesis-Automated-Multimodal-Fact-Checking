## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website boughtbyzionism.org ([https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit](https://www.boughtbyzionism.org/vpharriscomplicit)) discusses Vice President Kamala Harris's support for Israel, referencing an endorsement by the Jewish Democratic Coalition of America on July 22, 2024, and includes an image ![image 1552](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007798-062130.jpg) of protestors. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/)) published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's ![image 1560](media/2025-07-20_10-36-1753007807-426714.jpg).

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including her call for a cease-fire and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/)) also reported on the July 25, 2024 meeting, noting Harris urged a Gaza ceasefire and stated, "It is time for this war to end" ![image 9567](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515446-311830.jpg). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)) covered the meeting on July 26, 2024, highlighting Harris's statement, "I will not be silent" on the suffering in Gaza, and her "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ![image 9568](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515449-163680.jpg), ![image 9569](media/2025-08-30_00-57-1756515452-200811.jpg).


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms a meeting between Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu, but it occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024. During this meeting, Harris discussed Israel's right to defend itself and expressed an "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)).

The evidence does not provide the exact quote from the claim. However, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the idea that she would express continued support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely true in spirit, but the exact wording and date are not directly confirmed.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and discussed Israel's right to defend itself, expressing unwavering commitment to Israel's existence. While the exact quote from the claim ("Our support for Israel will continue") is not directly found, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the claim's sentiment. However, the date is off.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed support for Israel, the meeting occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024, as stated in the claim. Although the sentiment of the claim aligns with Harris's statements, the specific date is inaccurate.
