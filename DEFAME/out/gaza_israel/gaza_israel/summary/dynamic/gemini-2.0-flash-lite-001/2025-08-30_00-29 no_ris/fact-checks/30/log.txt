The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While the BBC did report on the Bibas family, the exact title presented in the claim is not confirmed by the evidence. The BBC published an article on February 3, 2025, titled "Israeli hostage's family demand answers over fate of his wife and children" ([Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry3jzedl1o)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
