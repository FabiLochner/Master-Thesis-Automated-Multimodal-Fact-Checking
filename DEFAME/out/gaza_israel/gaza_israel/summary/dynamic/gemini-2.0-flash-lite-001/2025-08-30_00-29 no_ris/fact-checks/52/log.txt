Useful result: From [Source](https://www.statista.com/topics/11678/gaza-strip/): 
Content: The Statista Research Department published a report on June 30, 2025, discussing statistics and facts about the Gaza Strip. The report mentions that the Gaza Strip has a population of 2.1 million and is one of the most densely populated regions. It also mentions that the population is quite young, with most inhabitants under 15 years old. The report includes data on the total population of Gaza from 1950 to 2015 with projections until 2050 <image:1676>. The report also mentions the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, stating that since November 19, an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza have become internally displaced refugees <image:1705>. The report also provides data on the number of Palestinian and Israeli casualties caused by the war since October 7, 2023 <image:1704>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://worldpopulationreview.com/cities/palestine/gaza): 
Content: The World Population Review estimates Gaza's 2025 population at 823,407, with a 2.84% annual growth. The population grew by 22,771 in the last year. The source is the UN World Urbanization Prospects.

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is disputed. While the New York City Foreign Policy Association ([NYCFPA](https://nycfpa.org/12/19/population-in-gaza-has-increased-by-2-02-since-october-7-2023/)) states an increase of 2.02% based on growth forecasts, other sources like CNN and The Times of Israel report a population decrease of 6% since October 7, 2023, due to the ongoing conflict.

So, the overall veracity is: false
