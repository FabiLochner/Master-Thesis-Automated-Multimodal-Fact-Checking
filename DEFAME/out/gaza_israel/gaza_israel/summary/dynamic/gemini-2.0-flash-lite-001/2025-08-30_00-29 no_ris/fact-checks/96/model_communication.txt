Content: "They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/global-outcry-over-israels-targeting-of-palestinian-children): 
Content: "This is not the first time we have been targeted by the Israeli authorities.

“Previously they would attack through proxy, pro-Israel organisations trying to slander us and undermine our reputation with our partners and donors but that never worked,” Abu Eqtaish told Al Jazeera.

Manal Tamimi, an activist from another family of Nabi Saleh’s Tamimi clan, said children in the village were regularly targeted and some of this targeting was to punish their parents for their political activism.

Manal’s husband Bilal has been regularly assaulted by Israeli soldiers for documenting their abuses during previous clashes with Palestinian youths in the village.

Several years ago, Manal was shot in the leg with live ammunition at the beginning of one demonstration.

“I was warned on my Facebook page prior to the protest that my blood would be spilled that day and at the beginning of the protest I was shot in the leg with a .22 bullet, which caused the bone to break,” she told Al Jazeera.

Her son Osama was previously imprisoned for nine months for allegedly taking part in protests.

However, it was the arrest and detention of her son Samer several years ago, when he was 11 years old, that really stressed the family.

“Samer and two other boys of the same age were arrested from Nabi Saleh and another village,” said Manal.

“The soldiers had come into the village, despite everything being quiet and they snatched two of the boys when they were near the supermarket and put them into a military jeep.

“I and several other women tried to physically stop the jeep but we couldn’t.

“We then went to the military checkpoint at the entrance of the village and shouted at the soldiers to tell us where the boys were but they wouldn’t.

“My husband and I were extremely worried as we didn’t know where he was or whether he’d been injured.”

Samer Tamimi was arrested even though he was only 11 years old at the time \[Al Jazeera\]

Blindfolds and handcuffs
------------------------

Samer recalled his frightening experience.

“I was blindfolded and handcuffed and taken to a military base where we were all made to sit on the floor for six hours and questioned,” Samer told Al Jazeera.

During this time, none of the boys was given any food or water, and neither were their blindfolds or handcuffs removed.

Samer was also shown a video by the soldiers of his mother protesting at the checkpoint to frighten him. The boys were eventually released later that night following intervention by Palestinian officials.

“But now my son has a file and he is not allowed to cross through Israeli checkpoints even though he is only 15,” said Manal.

Manal said about 85 children from the village had been arrested over the years, 10 of them under 15. “More than 500 villagers had also been wounded, and five people were killed.”

She said soldiers in the village made life hard for the children by erecting regular checkpoints and stopping children from going to school, in addition to the beatings and arrests.

‘Willful killings’
------------------

On July 28, Muhammad Abu Sara, 11, [died from a gunshot](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_and_kill_11_year_old_palestinian_boy_in_hebron)
 wound to the chest after Israeli soldiers fired 13 rounds at his father’s car in the Palestinian village of Beit Ummar in the southern West Bank.

Again, there were no clashes in the village that day.

The Israeli soldiers said the vehicle failed to stop when ordered to do so. But Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP) said that under international law, intentional lethal force was only justified in circumstances where a direct threat to life or of serious injury was present.

“However, investigations and evidence collected by DCIP regularly suggest that Israeli forces use lethal force against Palestinian children in circumstances that may amount to extrajudicial or willful killings,” said DCIP.

On Tuesday, a 15-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli live fire in the occupied West Bank. The Palestinian health ministry said Imad Khaled Saleh Hashash died after sustaining a gunshot wound to the head.

The deaths of the three boys were among 12 children killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank this year, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

Another 67 children were killed in Gaza during Israel’s attack in May.

According to DCIP, seven children were killed in Gaza and the West Bank in 2020.

‘Rights of children’
--------------------

This spike in the number of child fatalities, and a raid on the DCIP offices in Al Bireh by Israeli security forces at the end of July, led human rights experts from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to call on the Israeli government to “immediately return confidential documents and office equipment that its military seized from the offices of the DCIP”.

“We are deeply concerned by the Israeli military’s interference with the human rights work of a well-known and well-regarded NGO,” said the experts.

Computers, hard drives, binders and other materials were taken from DCIP’s offices during the nighttime raid.

“The indispensable work of Palestinian, Israeli and international civil society organisations has provided a measure of much-needed accountability in documenting and scrutinising the dispiriting human rights trends in the occupied Palestinian territory,” OHCHR said.

DCIP provided critical and reliable reporting on the patterns of arrests, maimings, and killings of Palestinian children by the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza, the organisation added.

“All civilian lives under occupation are protected under international law. ![Palestine air strike 16 july 2014](/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a04f5e23c755494ab522d6d44b31f181_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80)

**Nabi Saleh, Occupied West Bank** – “Mama, mama where is Muhammad?” an agitated Omar Tamimi, 3, repeatedly asked his mother.

Trying hard not to break down in front of her children, Bara’a Tamimi, from the village of Nabi Saleh, near Ramallah, tried to comfort her son before breaking down and weeping.

 three times with live ammunition.

“We rushed him to hospital but he died less than an hour after he was shot. They couldn’t save him,” Bara’a told Al Jazeera.

There were no clashes in the village that day on July 23, but Israeli soldiers had been coming into the village on an almost daily basis and provoking the locals, shooting tear gas canisters into homes and swearing at the villagers.

Nabi Saleh is home to about 600 people, mostly from the Tamimi clan, and has a history of activism, which included regular Friday protests in the past.

“Muhammad was in the backyard when the soldiers shot tear gas into our home, forcing me to take the other young children into the inner rooms of the home for their safety,” said Bara’a as she recalled the events leading up to Muhammad’s killing.

“A verbal confrontation then ensued between Muhammad and the soldiers before he later went out to look for one of his brothers who has cancer in one of his eyes and can’t see properly. This is particularly true for the rights of children,” the OHCHR experts said.

DCIP is waiting for a military court hearing on Tuesday to determine whether the files and equipment confiscated from their office will be returned.

“On the same day the military raided our office our lawyers notified Ofer Military Court of the issue and they contacted the military legal adviser requesting the files and equipment be returned by August 16,” DCIP spokesman Ayed Abu Eqtaish told Al Jazeera.

“The legal adviser twice refused to return the stuff saying an investigation was being carried out, so we are taking the matter to court."

Mayar and Bilal are two children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida. They were though attached to each other always playing together and having fun at home while enjoying the love of their parents. 

All those who knew Mayar said she was a smart girl as she excelled in her school subjects and was dreaming of becoming a journalist just like her father but the Israeli hideous bombardment ended her dream by killing her along with her brother Bilal and their mother in October 2023. 

Their father who has been covering the Israeli aggression on Gaza as many other journalists was left alone to continue his job with grief and pain for his great loss and concern over losing more of his family members. 

Since October 7 Israel has been waging a heinous genocide in Gaza Strip via air ground and sea attacks resulting in more than 40000 martyrs wounded and missing people. 

“We Are Not Numbers” is a series that reviews part of the available stories of some Palestinian martyrs who have fallen in the Israeli aggression on Gaza.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image <image:63>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.

At least 16 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli attack on a United Nations-run school sheltering displaced people in the Gaza Strip, the Gaza Government Media Office said, as Israel continues to pound the besieged coastal territory.

In a statement on Saturday, the Government Media Office said more than 75 people also were injured in the attack on al-Jaouni school in central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp.

 by the Israeli military since the Gaza war began in early October.

At least 38,098 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza since October 7 and the besieged enclave faces dire shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

On Saturday, dozens of Palestinians, [including five journalists](/news/2024/7/6/five-journalists-killed-as-israel-steps-up-bombardment-across-gaza)
, were killed as the Israeli military stepped up its bombardment of the territory.

Videos taken at the scene of the attack on the UNRWA school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat showed twisted metal at the collapsed building. Emergency workers also tried to cover two bodies as they were quickly brought into the medical complex.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement that 50 injured Palestinians were taken to the hospital.

In a [statement](https://x.com/IDF/status/1809662855660360020)
 shared on social media on Saturday night, the Israeli army said its air force “struck several terrorists” in the area of al-Jaouni school.

Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said hundreds of Palestinian families had sought shelter at the school after they were forced to flee Israel’s bombardment in other parts of Gaza.

The families “chose the middle area \[of the Gaza Strip\] because Israeli forces said the middle area is a safe zone”, Khoudary said.

“Everyone in the Gaza Strip believes that they are not safe, wherever they go.”

Last month, an Israeli attack on an UN-linked school – also in Nuseirat refugee camp – [killed at least 40 people](/news/2024/6/6/israel-bombs-unrwa-school-in-gaza-kills-32-displaced-palestinians)
 and injured dozens more, according to local authorities.

Musab, a 17-year-old survivor of the early June bombing of the UNRWA Nuseirat Boys’ Preparatory School, told the UN agency that his father was killed after “missiles rained down” on the family.

“Concrete slabs fell on us, and suddenly, we found ourselves surrounded by the dead and injured. All of my family members were either injured or killed,” [Musab said](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/features/no-shelter-war-bombing-block-2-unrwa-nuseirat-school)
 in testimony shared by UNRWA.

“We were sleeping, and at two in the morning, missiles rained down on us. A young boy could be seen sifting through pools of blood on the ground.

Footage shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir el-Balah and verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad agency also showed children and young people being rushed from ambulances.

They included a girl with a bandaged arm, another with a bloodied face and a boy bandage across his head. They pulled us from under the rubble, and all we saw were shrapnel, debris, and dust. How will we live?”

Gaza: Deaths and devastation during hostage rescue operation show ‘seismic trauma’ of ongoing war
=================================================================================================

9 June 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The scenes of devastation witnessed in the aftermath of Israel’s military operation to release hostages from the Nuseirat refugee camp proves that each day the war continues “it only grows more horrific” the UN’s [top humanitarian official](https://www.unocha.org/our-leadership/martin-griffiths)
 said on Sunday.

According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 270 people including children and other non-combatants were killed during intense fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in and around the Nuseirat refugee camp on Saturday, in the middle area of the war-torn enclave. More than 40 of the hostages are believed to have died so far with more than 110 reportedly remaining.

**Healthcare ‘hanging by a thread’**
------------------------------------

“Seeing bloodied patients being treated on hospital floors, **we are reminded that healthcare in Gaza is hanging by a thread**.”

Video from Al-Aqsa Hospital in the aftermath of the fighting and bombardment shows numerous casualties lying on the floor while the director of Al-Adwa Hospital in Nuseirat reported that no morgue is available at the hospital to house the bodies of the dead.

Negotiations continue for a comprehensive ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas but a United States-led proposal presented on 31 May has not been accepted by either side.

Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said [in a post on X](https://twitter.com/UNReliefChief/status/1799628590323003821)
 that the Nuseirat camp “is **the epicentre of the seismic trauma that civilians in Gaza continue to suffer**.”

“Seeing shrouded bodies on the ground, we are reminded that **nowhere is safe** in Gaza”, he continued.

Saturday's carnage followed on from [an Israeli attack on a UN school](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/06/1150721)
 building-turned shelter in the same area on Thursday, which left dozens dead. This collective agony can and must end now.”

The emergency relief chief added that seeing the video footage from the scene of shrouded bodies in Nuseirat camp was a reminder that nowhere is safe in the enclave, where Israel has carried out a nine months long offensive since the Hamas-led terror attacks of 7 October.

Palestinian militants took over 250 hostage in southern Israel that day, massacring some 1,200 people. All of them must be released.”

[In a tweet](https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1799463765634941127)
 on Saturday following news of the hostages being freed, UN chief António Guterres said he had sent messages to the relatives of Noa Argamani and Shalomi Ziv - some of whose family members he had received at the UN last week - to express his relief.

“**I renew my appeal for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and for an end to this war**”, said the Secretary-General.

Mr. Local officials reported that 37 people were killed in the school building attack, including 14 children.

**Scores of hostages still held**
---------------------------------

The Humanitarian Affairs chief said that even as the four hostages were reunited with their families in Israel thanks to the military operation “scores are still being held captive. Griffiths asserted that “all civilians must be protected."

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'United Arab Emirates': 0.25, 'Jordan': 0.23, 'Pakistan': 0.17, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.05, 'Israel': 0.04, 'Malta': 0.02, 'India': 0.01, 'Nigeria': 0.01, 'Rwanda': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) discusses an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, where hostages were rescued. The article mentions over 270 Palestinians were killed. The image <image:63>

## Elaboration
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd)) mentions an Israeli operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp on June 8, 2024, which resulted in over 270 Palestinian deaths. The claim states the children were killed on July 6, 2024, which is after the date of the operation mentioned in the CNN article.

The geolocation of the image suggests the image was most likely taken in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, or Tunisia, with a low probability of being taken in Palestine or Israel.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided information. More information is needed to confirm the children's deaths, including the date and location.
