Summary 2024/8  
19 July 2024  
Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem Summary of the Advisory Opinion of 19 July 2024  
Chronology of the procedure (paras 1-21)  
The Court first recalls that on 19 January 2023, the Secretary-General of the United Nations officially communicated to the Court the decision taken by the General Assembly to submit the questions set forth in resolution 77/247 adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (hereinafter the “General Assembly”) on 30 December 2022. Decides, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, to request the International Court of Justice, pursuant to Article 65 of the Statute of the Court, to render an advisory opinion on the following questions, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, relevant resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, and the advisory opinion of the Court of 9 July 2004:  
(a) What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures? 
The Court emphasizes that the conclusion that Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal does not release it from its obligations and responsibilities under international law, particularly the law of occupation, towards the Palestinian population and towards other States in respect of the exercise of its powers in relation to the territory until such time as its presence is brought to an end. 
On 10 June 2024, the Security Council adopted resolution 2735 (2024), whereby it reiterated  
“its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and in this regard stresse\[d\] the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”. If and to the extent that the Court finds that any of Israel’s policies and practices, or its continued presence, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory are contrary to international law, the Court indicates that it will examine the legal consequences flowing from such findings for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. The Court therefore addresses the legal consequences arising from Israel’s policies and practices referred to in question (a) for Israel, together with those arising from the illegality of Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory under question (b), for Israel, for other States and for the United Nations. 273-279)  
The Court then turns to the legal consequences of Israel’s internationally wrongful acts in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as regards other States. 
With regard to the right to self-determination, the Court considers that, while it is for the General Assembly and the Security Council to pronounce on the modalities required to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, all States must co-operate with the United Nations to put those modalities into effect. It is for all States, while respecting the Charter of the United Nations and international law, to ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the exercise of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end. 285) reads as follows:  
For these reasons,  
THE COURT,  
(1) Unanimously,  
Finds that it has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested;  
(2) By fourteen votes to one,  
Decides to comply with the request for an advisory opinion;

### **Report of the Secretary-General**

### **I. I recognize that the 19 July 2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, requested by the General Assembly in December 2022, was rendered in a drastically different context – nine months after the horrifying 7 October 2023 attacks, which dramatically altered the dynamics for Israelis and Palestinians. On 16 October, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) sent a note verbale to the Permanent Missions of all Member States, the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine and all observers of the General Assembly in Geneva inviting them to share their views on proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion, in accordance with paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES-10/14](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185702/)
    _. Legal measures seeking accountability for violations of international law as mentioned in the responses received from Member States and observers include the following:

*   Providing written or oral submissions in support of ongoing legal proceedings that seek accountability for violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in the International Court of Justice, and ensuring cooperation with the International Criminal Court
*   Supporting the establishment of an “international register of damage” as provided for in paragraph 10 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _
*   Advocating for reparations for damages, loss or injury arising from the internationally wrongful acts of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
*   Strengthening legislative frameworks to support Palestinian self-determination and carrying out legal actions for violations of international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, through domestic and international courts.

### **IV. In paragraph 14 of resolution _[ES‑10/24](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/ga-10th-ess-resolution-18sep24/)
    _, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Member States with relevant experience and expertise, to present proposals for the establishment of a mechanism to follow up on the violations by Israel of article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination identified by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion.

World Leaders Must Act to End Israel’s Unlawful Presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
==============================================================================================

21 April 2025

[Open Letter](https://www.globalr2p.org/publications/?s=&filter[]=open-letter&tax=publication_type#search)

Over six months have passed since the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly [voted in favour](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154496)
 of adopting a resolution that gave effect to the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) July 2024 Advisory Opinion, stating that Israel “brings to an end without delay its unlawful presence” in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) within 12 months. Rather than complying, Israel has intensified its violence in the West Bank and renewed its blockade and military bombardment of Gaza, breaking a fragile two-month ceasefire and further exacerbating the human-made humanitarian crisis.

We, the undersigned organisations, call upon global leaders to uphold their legal and moral responsibilities in light of the ICJ’s Advisory Opinion and the UN General Assembly resolution. 

The ICJ affirmed that Israel’s occupation of the oPt (the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza) is illegal under international law, and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations, including restitution and compensation. Any actions that obstruct the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance to the civilian population not only result in widespread loss of life and suffering, but also contribute to further entrenchment of Israel’s unlawful presence. 

**The Time for Action is Now**

We urge all states to take concrete steps to uphold the ICJ’s findings and to ensure an end to Israel’s illegal occupation. The continued impunity for Israel’s violations only exacerbates the suffering of the Palestinian people and undermines the rule of international law. 

We also call on states to urgently take decisive actions to enforce an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 446: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Mozambique and Children and Armed Conflict\

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gcr2p) The ICJ also confirmed that Israel’s policies breach the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid; reaffirmed the Palestinian right to self-determination; and declared Israel’s prolonged annexationist occupation an internationally wrongful act.

**The Dire Humanitarian Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory**

The humanitarian situation in the oPt was dire even before October 2023, marked by Israel’s prolonged blockade of Gaza, severe restrictions on movement, and excessive use of force in the West Bank. **Hold Israel accountable for violations of international humanitarian law.**
3. All states are legally bound to recognise Israel’s presence in the oPt as unlawful, not aid Israel in maintaining it, and cooperate to end this situation. Since then, in Gaza, Israel’s military assault has displaced nearly 90% of Palestinians, destroyed entire neighbourhoods, and created catastrophic conditions, with people surviving in makeshift shelters with little access to water or medical care, and pushed to the brink of famine. 

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, intensified Israeli military assaults, unlawful use of force, mass arrests, and settler violence have led to a rise in killings, massive scale forcible transfer, and severe restrictions on movement. The escalation of military attacks is not just sporadic violence or isolated policies, but reflects a strategy of annexation by Israeli authorities."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024 regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to cease its presence, end settlement activities, and provide reparations. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful.

The evidence supports the claim that the ICJ issued a ruling in July 2024. However, the claim misrepresents the nature of the ruling. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate.

The incident was a reminder of the soaring tensions in the Middle East, as speculation swirled about whether Iran and Iran-backed groups would make good on threats to retaliate after a series of [Israeli major blows](/world/middle-east/israeli-military-has-begun-limited-raids-against-hezbollah-targets-border-area-2024-09-30/)
 against Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah.

Two Iraqi security sources said an initial investigation showed three rockets were fired, including one that landed near buildings used by Iraqi counter-terrorism forces, causing damages and fire to vehicles but no casualties.

The sources had previously said at least two Katyusha rockets were also fired at a military base hosting U.S. official said Washington was aware of reports of an attack instead on the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a Department of State facility.

"For details about the incident we refer you to the State Department," the official said.

A U.S. Department of State is assessing the damage caused by the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said there were no casualties.

Iraq's prime minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the security breach following the rocket attack, said a military spokesman for Iraqi Prime Minister and commander-in-chief of the armed forces Mohammed al-Sudani.

A rocket launcher was seized in a residential area in western Baghdad near the airport and three unfired rockets were dismantled, security sources said.

Iraqi security forces patrols stepped up patrolling the areas around the airport to prevent future attacks, said an Iraqi security official on condition of anonymity.

The prime minister has ordered that the findings of the investigation to determine the perpetrators of the attack must be revealed within 48 hours, the official said.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms attacks in Baghdad around that time, including a rocket attack on a military base hosting US forces on October 1, 2024 ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)), the provided sources do not specify that the image depicts a US facility.

The image search results show explosions in Baghdad, but the specific context of the image in the claim is not confirmed. The evidence also mentions the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, but it does not directly link this conflict to the Baghdad attacks.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the lack of direct evidence linking the image to a US facility attack in Baghdad on the specified date and the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:11>)
web_search("Baghdad facility attack September 30 2024")
image_search("Baghdad facility explosion")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Nigeria': 0.13, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Ukraine': 0.08, 'Chile': 0.05, 'Ecuador': 0.03, 'Ghana': 0.03, 'Taiwan': 0.03, 'Bangladesh': 0.02, 'Belgium': 0.02, 'Brazil': 0.02}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss attacks and escalating tensions in the Middle East during late September and early October 2024. Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)) reports a rocket attack near Baghdad International Airport on October 1, 2024, targeting a military base hosting U.S. troops. ReliefWeb ([Source](https://reliefweb.int/report/iraq/ishm-september-26-october-3-2024)) mentions attacks by militias on Israel and Baghdad airport between September 28 and October 2, 2024, including attacks on September 30.

The Wikipedia article ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israeli_attacks_against_Lebanon)) details the September 2024 Israeli attacks against Lebanon, part of the ongoing Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which occurred between September 23 and September 30, 2024. The article mentions Hezbollah firing rockets into northern Israel and the Golan Heights on September 30, 2024. The image <image:11>

### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles about explosions in Baghdad. One article from Military Times discusses an explosion in an arms depot north of the Iraqi capital, and another from Iranpress.com reports an explosion at a military base in Taji, north of Baghdad. <image:3117>, <image:3118>

The provided sources do not contain information about a US facility coming under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, or the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms attacks in Baghdad around that time, including a rocket attack on a military base hosting US forces on October 1, 2024 ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)), the provided sources do not specify that the image depicts a US facility.

The image search results show explosions in Baghdad, but the specific context of the image in the claim is not confirmed. The evidence also mentions the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, but it does not directly link this conflict to the Baghdad attacks.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the lack of direct evidence linking the image to a US facility attack in Baghdad on the specified date and the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

**The US Embassy in Baghdad assessed that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias likely conducted the attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[1\] CTP-ISW also assessed on September 11 that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted the September 10 attack.** The US Embassy in Baghdad said on September 11 that an attack targeted the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound, a US diplomatic facility.\[2\] An unspecified military official told AFP on September 11 that militants fired two Katyusha-type rockets in the attack. The last joint attack occurred on June 15.\[36\] A US self-defense strike on July 30 targeting a prominent Iranian-backed Iraqi militia facility killed a Houthi drone expert who had traveled to Iraq to train other Iranian-backed Iraqi militias in drone tactics, indicating the deepening relationship between Iraqi groups and the Houthis.\[37\]

**Key Takeaways**:

*   **Iraq:** The US Embassy in Baghdad assessed that Iranian-backed Iraqi militias likely conducted the attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10. The level of damage that the vehicle sustained is inconsistent with a VBIED detonation, which usually leaves only burned-out remnants of a vehicle or no recognizable vehicle at all.

**The IDF said on September 12 that it killed three senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike in the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on September 11.\[58\]** The IDF said that the fighters planned and conducted small arms and improvised explosive device attacks against Israeli forces.\[59\] One of the fighters also killed an Israeli border police officer in October 2023.\[60\]

**Southern Lebanon and Golan Heights**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Deter Israel from conducting a ground operation into Lebanon
*   Prepare for an expanded and protracted conflict with Israel in the near term
*   Expel the United States from Syria

**Iranian-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah, have conducted at least 11 attacks into northern Israel since CTP-ISW's last data cutoff on September 12.\[61\]** Lebanese Hezbollah launched approximately 20 rockets targeting the IDF’s Northern Command air defense base in Safed.\[62\] The IDF intercepted most of the rockets and the remainder fell in open areas.\[63\]  Lebanese Hezbollah separately conducted a drone attack targeting the headquarters of the IDF 210th Division in Safed.\[64\] The IDF reported that the drone fell in Upper Galilee and caused no casualties.\[65\]

Iran Update, September 13, 2024
===============================

Sep 13, 2024 - [ISW Press](/users/isw-press "View user profile.")

**Iran Update, September 13, 2024**

**Kelly Campa, Alexandra Braverman, Carolyn Moorman, Kathryn Tyson, Katherine Wells, and Brian Carter**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. One rocket struck the wall of an Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service building and the other rocked landed inside an international coalition base, presumably a reference to the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound.\[3\] CTP–ISW previously noted that Iranian-backed Iraqi militants seem to have conducted the attack against the wishes of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias.\[4\] The US Embassy called on the Iraqi government to protect US and coalition personnel and facilities.\[5\] The US government has often emphasized to the Iraqi government, especially Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani, the importance of ensuring the safety of US forces following Iranian-backed Iraqi militia attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria.\[6\]

**Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar sent a letter to Lebanese Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah vowing to continue Hamas’ fight against Israel, according to Hezbollah-affiliated media.\[7\]** Sinwar reportedly wrote the letter at an unspecified date after former Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh’s death on July 31.\[8\] Hezbollah-affiliated _Al Mayadeen_ reported that Sinwar wrote that Hamas will “remain steadfast” until Israel is defeated and an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital is established.\[9\] Sinwar also thanked Nasrallah for Iranian-backed groups' efforts to support Hamas since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war.\[10\] Hezbollah began its cross-border attacks in northern Israel in October 2023 in support of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. This agreement requires Iraqi authorities to disarm and relocate members of Kurdish opposition groups away from the Iran-Iraq border.\[23\] Talabani reiterated his commitment to securing the border between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan.\[24\] This marked the first time an Iranian President traveled to Iraqi Kurdistan.\[25\]

Pezeshkian also visited religious sites in Karbala and Najaf on September 12.\[26\] Pezeshkian emphasized the need for unity amongst Muslims in a meeting with Iraqi elites, academics, and nomads in Basra on September 13.\[27\] Pezeshkian reiterated his support for concepts that would enable the free movement of people between Muslim countries in a fashion similar to the European Union.\[28\] Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Abbas Araghchi accompanied Pezeshkian on the trip.\[29\] Pezeshkian returned to Tehran from Basra on September 13.\[30\]

**Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Sayyid al Shuhada Secretary General Abu Alaa al Walai claimed Iranian-backed Iraqi militias will soon begin their fourth phase of operations against Israel.\[31\]** Walai explained in an interview with Iranian state-owned media this phase will include joint military operations and coordinated actions between Iranian-backed Iraqi groups and other Axis of Resistance members across multiple fronts. In the third phase, Iranian-backed Iraqi groups conducted joint operations with the Houthis.\[32\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias that includes Kataib Sayyid al Shuhada, conducted over 170 attacks targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria between October 2023-January 2024.\[33\] Other Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have conducted occasional attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since January 2024, but the Islamic Resistance in Iraq targeted Israel in most of its attacks after January 2024.\[34\]  CTP-ISW has also reported extensively on how the military relationship between the Houthis and Iranian-backed Iraqi militias has deepened in recent months.\[35\] The Houthis and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq first claimed to conduct a joint drone attack targeting Israel on June 6. Multiple entrances and exits to a tunnel network improve its resilience.
*   **Iranian Retaliation:** The Pentagon announced on September 12 that the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group is leaving the CENTCOM area of responsibility and is en route to the Indo-Pacific area of command.
*   **Iran:** Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian concluded his official three-day trip to Iraq on September 13.

**Gaza Strip**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Erode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to sustain clearing operations in the Gaza Strip
*   Reestablish Hamas as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip

**Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired rockets targeting Israeli forces along the Netzarim Corridor on September 13.\[38\]**

**The IDF appeared to continue clearing operations in Rafah on September 12.** Commercially available satellite imagery captured on September 12 shows flattened terrain and destroyed buildings northeast of Taha Hussein Street in Rafah, indicating that Israeli tanks or bulldozers operated in Rafah."

The search results include articles about explosions in Baghdad. One article from Military Times discusses an explosion in an arms depot north of the Iraqi capital, and another from Iranpress.com reports an explosion at a military base in Taji, north of Baghdad. <image:3117>, <image:3118>

The provided sources do not contain information about a US facility coming under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, or the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.


## Elaboration
The claim that the image shows a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, cannot be verified. While the evidence confirms attacks in Baghdad around that time, including a rocket attack on a military base hosting US forces on October 1, 2024 ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rocket-attack-targets-military-base-hosting-us-forces-baghdad-military-sources-2024-09-30/)), the provided sources do not specify that the image depicts a US facility.

The image search results show explosions in Baghdad, but the specific context of the image in the claim is not confirmed. The evidence also mentions the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, but it does not directly link this conflict to the Baghdad attacks.

Therefore, the claim's veracity is uncertain due to the lack of direct evidence linking the image to a US facility attack in Baghdad on the specified date and the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024): 
Content: The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published an "Iran Update" on September 13, 2024, discussing attacks on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, which the US Embassy assessed were likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. <image:5913> The update also mentions the IDF killing senior PIJ fighters in a drone strike on September 11, 2024, in the West Bank. The update also discusses the objectives of the Axis of Resistance, including deterring Israel from conducting a ground operation into Lebanon and preparing for an expanded conflict. The update also mentions that Iranian-backed militias, including Hezbollah, have conducted at least 11 attacks into northern Israel since September 12, 2024. <image:5911>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources discuss attacks on US facilities in Baghdad. One source from Stripes.com ([Source](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/middle_east/2021-06-01/Militia-attack-on-U.S.-Embassy-in-Baghdad-caused-35-million-in-fire-damage-in-2019-1616430.html)) mentions a militia attack on the U.S. Embassy in 2019, causing significant damage. Another source from Business Insider ([Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-embassy-rocket-attack-baghdad-2020-1)) reports on a rocket attack on the US embassy. <image:3693>, <image:3695>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that attacks on US facilities in Baghdad occurred, including an attack on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, which was likely conducted by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias ([Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024)). However, the provided sources do not confirm that the image depicts a US facility under attack on September 30, 2024. The evidence also mentions the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, but it does not directly link this conflict to the Baghdad attacks.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of specific evidence connecting the image to a US facility attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, and the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while attacks on US facilities in Baghdad have occurred, and there was an escalation of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, there is no direct evidence to confirm that the image depicts a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024, as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While there were attacks on US facilities in Baghdad and escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts a US facility under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024. The provided sources mention attacks on a US diplomatic compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10, 2024, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah ([Source](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-13-2024)).

Montreal electronic traffic signs altered to display pro-Palestinian slogans

Montreal police are investigating after electronic message boards at two road construction sites in the city displayed pro-Palestinian political slogans Wednesday morning instead of usual traffic alerts.

The message boards, which normally advise motorists of roadwork, were tampered with to display phrases such as "free Palestine," "escalate now," and "globalize the intifada." By the end of the morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Intifada, which means "shaking off" in Arabic, was coined to describe an uprising against Israel's military occupation that erupted in 1987. She said "hijacking" signs that are meant to provide safety information to drivers with any kind of political message "raises huge alarm bells as to what these people are willing to do."

*   [ICJ says Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal](/news/world/icj-israel-occupation-ruling-1.7266424)
    

The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. He said that soon after it was noticed, the original messages were restored.

A group called Clash Mtl has claimed responsibility, writing on Instagram that it carried out the act during the night with the goal of showing "solidarity with Palestine." The group did not respond to a request for comment.

A Montreal police spokesperson said by email that they are aware of the situation and are investigating. The city administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Not a call for violence
-----------------------

Niall Clapham Ricardo with Independent Jewish Voices disputed that the messages are a call for violence, saying the slogans refer to a desire to end the violence and dispossession of Palestinians in the occupied territories as Israeli strikes continue to claim thousands of lives in Gaza.

Clapham Ricardo says part of the problem is that many wrongfully associate all Palestinian resistance with suicide bombing.

"We have to get out of this binary of freeing Palestine means violence against Jews. What became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response.

In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.

Eta Yudin, Quebec vice-president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the messages on the traffic signs an incitement to violence against Jews because she said "intifada" refers to terror attacks.

Her organization wants police to investigate what happened and measures to be put in place so it does not happen again. It said the signs in question belong to a private contractor hired by the city and are the responsibility of the contractor.

City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez said in an email that padlocks on the signs were broken, allowing someone to program the unauthorized messages. There's always going to be more war," he said.

McGill University political science professor Rex Brynen also says the Arabic word "intifada" does not inherently imply violence or non-violence and should therefore be understood as more of a rallying cry for protest.

Montreal police are investigating after electronic message boards at two road construction sites displayed pro-Palestinian political slogans Wednesday morning instead of usual traffic alerts.

The message boards that normally advise motorists of roadwork were hacked to display phrases such as “free Palestine,” “escalate now” and “globalize the intifada.” By the end of the morning, the original message had been restored for at least one of the sites.

Intifada, which means “shaking off” in Arabic, was coined to describe an uprising against Israel’s military occupation that erupted in 1987. He said that soon after it was noticed, the original messages were restored.

A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility for the hack, writing on Instagram that it carried out the act during the night with the goal of showing “solidarity with Palestine.” The group did not respond to a request for comment.

Graphic assembled by The Maple staff.

The City of Montreal is facing legal action after its employees were caught on camera tearing down pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election.

The signs belonged to LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), which is legally [registered](https://www.elections.ca/WPAPPS/WPR/EN/TP?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a third-party campaign group in the upcoming LaSalle—Émard—Verdun by-election, taking place on September 16.

The incident is the third time since 2008 that the City of Montreal inappropriately removed election signs belonging to Palestine solidarity groups and pro-Palestine political parties, raising questions about why such signs are being targeted.

LEV4P sent a cease and desist letter to the City on August 2. He pointed out that the City was [ordered](https://thecjn.ca/news/bds-group-awarded-damages-for-election-poster-removal/?ref=readthemaple.com)
 to pay $12,860 in punitive damages in 2018 for a similar incident involving pro-Palestine signs displayed by registered groups back in 2015.

“There’s no more good faith argument when it’s the third time, and when you’ve had a judge severely criticize you for this,” said Johnson.

LEV4P raised and spent approximately $3,000 on the signs, and those torn down by City workers on camera represented only a fraction of those that were distributed throughout the riding — before they were taken down. 

The signs highlighted Canada’s complicity in Israel’s war on Gaza, which is being [examined](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a case of genocide at the International Court of Justice, as well as more generic slogans calling for a free Palestine.

After the City admitted removing some of the signs, it returned 95 signs out of a total of 450. Johnson said that his clients could not simply replace the signs before getting them back from the City since they would be in danger of exceeding third-party spending limits.

In his view, this means the damage has already been done to the democratic process.

“This new violation which the City of Montreal has committed is so serious, and the effect that it can have is a sort of chilling effect,” Johnson explained. 

“That’s the danger when public authorities intervene to limit freedom of speech: It can undermine people’s confidence in our democracy. “We know that the silencing of voices in favour of the national liberation of Palestine and silencing of voices denouncing the genocide in Gaza is something that’s going on across the board.”

He noted that Jeremy Levi, the mayor of the Montreal suburb of Hampstead and a [vocal](https://x.com/jerlevi/status/1820976230205698248?ref=readthemaple.com)

 of Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza, [tweeted](https://x.com/jerlevi/status/1817660532020658613?ref=readthemaple.com)
 on July 28 that the election signs were “hate propaganda,” and called on Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante to “take a stand and restore order in our city.”

When challenged by LEV4P during a City council meeting about the removal of the signs, Mayor Plante stressed that the previous case took place nearly a decade ago. “To me, it is motivated by the message on our signs.”

Canada’s role in Israel’s war on Gaza has proven to be a potent issue in the upcoming by-election, which was triggered following the resignation of Liberal MP and justice minister David Lametti in January.

Last week, CBC News [reported](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-staffers-gaza-montreal-byelection-1.7306984?ref=readthemaple.com)
 that 52 Arab and Muslim staffers in the Liberal government signed a letter saying they would not participate in the by-election campaign due to Justin Trudeau’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

“We can no longer in good conscience campaign for a party that excludes us and our values,” CBC quoted the letter as reading.

The staffers’ demands included “explicitly condemning Israel for its numerous war crimes and for the genocidal rhetoric from members of the Israeli Cabinet,” recognizing the State of Palestine, and revoking all existing permits for arms exports to Israel, including those that are [shipped](https://www.readthemaple.com/u-s-names-quebec-contractor-in-newly-approved-arms-sale-to-israel/)

### **Repeated Incidents**

The first time the City [removed](https://canadiandimension.com/blog/view/westmount-on-warpath-against-communist-candidates-election-posters?ref=readthemaple.com)
 pro-Palestine election signs was in 2008, when municipal authorities removed signs belonging to the Communist Party of Canada candidate Bill Sloan in the Westmount neighbourhood.

Following that incident, municipal authorities signed an agreement with Elections Canada to not allow such an infringement to occur again, according to Johnson. 

The second incident occurred in 2015, when the Communist Party and a third-party group promoting Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel put up signs denouncing Israel’s human rights violations and occupation of Palestine.

As with the incident in this year’s by-election, in 2015 the City claimed the removals were good faith errors made due to the disturbing imagery on some of the signs, which depicted the body of a Palestinian boy killed by the Israeli military in Gaza.

The two groups took the City to court, which ruled that the City had intentionally violated the fundamental rights of the citizens who displayed the signs, according to Johnson. To his knowledge, none of the coalition’s signs were removed by the City of Montreal.

“Our clients are very justified in having some very serious questions about the motivation of the city in taking down these posters,” said Johnson. “I don’t think that is a defence that will hold up in court.”

In an emailed statement sent in French and translated into English by The Maple using an online tool, the City of Montreal said it would not comment on the matter due to the possibility of legal action.

“The City confirms having received a copy of the formal notice from the Lasalle-Émard-Verdun organization for Palestine,” the City said."

# Your Analysis

The evidence confirms that traffic signs in Montreal displayed the "Free Palestine" message, matching the image. However, the signs were altered at construction sites, and the City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. The evidence does not support the claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "free Palestine" and "escalate now" (<image:13>). The signs were altered at two construction sites and the original messages were restored. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. A group called Clash Mtl claimed responsibility.

The City of Montreal has a history of removing pro-Palestine signs. The article from The Maple mentions that Jeremy Levi, the mayor of Hampstead, called on Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante to take a stand against the signs.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that traffic signs in Montreal displayed the "Free Palestine" message, matching the image. However, the signs were altered at construction sites, and the City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. The evidence does not support the claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.


## Final Judgement
The image is of a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message. The signs were altered at construction sites, and the City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. The claim that the message was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message, which was confirmed by multiple sources, including the CBC and the Montreal Gazette ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809), [https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans)). However, the signs were altered at construction sites, and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism, with no evidence suggesting the message was authorized by Mayor Valérie Plante.

Washington CNN  — 

During her [first official White House briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/media/karoline-leavitt-first-press-conference/index.html)
 as President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had prevented a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Trump’s team, [she said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-january-28-2025/)
, used the president’s [pause on foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-impact/index.html)
 to thwart a plan in which “there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”

Leavitt’s Tuesday comments made headlines around the world. And when CNN asked Leavitt and her colleagues for any evidence, another White House official instead pointed us to comments from the State Department — comments that, as we’ll discuss below, did not even repeat Leavitt’s claim of a planned $50 million Gaza condom expenditure, let alone prove the claim.

**In three previous years under Biden, USAID spent _no_ money on condoms in the entire Middle East**: A detailed [federal report published last year](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 said USAID did not provide or fund _any_ condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

The report, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-executive-orders-transgender-troops-dei-covid-us-politics-live?page=with:block-679977268f086189f840e07b#block-679977268f086189f840e07b)
 by The Guardian on Tuesday, said the only Middle East contraceptives provided or funded by USAID during that three-year period went to the country of Jordan in fiscal 2023. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.” She did not specify how much of the $102 million in funding was intended for contraception, let alone for condoms in particular.

In an email to reporters earlier Tuesday, Bruce said the entity that was supposed to get $102 million is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that [operates two field hospitals in Gaza](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/gaza/)
.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, International Medical Corps said that it has received about $68 million from the US Agency for International Development for Gaza operations since October 7, 2023, the day of Hamas’ major attack on Israel. And the president himself told an even more dramatic version of the story in a speech on Wednesday, saying that “we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

But there are at least five big reasons to be skeptical that the story is true.

**The White House offered no evidence for the story**: Leavitt provided no proof for her claim that there was ever a federal plan to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza. This was “a small order of injectables and progestin-only contraceptive pills” totaling about $46,000.

**Total worldwide USAID condom spending is far less than $50 million**: In the 2023 fiscal year, USAID provided or funded a global total of about $7.1 million worth of male condoms and about $1.1 million worth of female condoms, overwhelmingly to countries in Africa, according to the federal report.

In other words, Leavitt was essentially claiming Tuesday that the Biden administration had decided to provide more than six times the 2023 worldwide value of condoms to a single tiny territory that has [about 2.1 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html)
 and that is in a region that usually does not receive condoms from the US.

A former senior Biden official who worked on Gaza aid issues told CNN that Leavitt’s story about a $50 million condom expenditure for Gaza was “imaginary.” The former official said: “It’s a lie, they are making s\*\*\* up.”

**The State Department would not repeat Leavitt’s claim**: The White House official pointed to a series of social media posts from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who listed specific examples of how Trump’s aid pause had prevented what Bruce called unjustified spending that wouldn’t make the country “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

But Bruce did not mention $50 million for condoms in Gaza.

Instead, Bruce was vague about how much condom spending was supposedly stopped. While International Medical Corps has [publicly discussed](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story/youre-pregnant-in-gaza-what-happens-next/)
 its reproductive and sexual health services in Gaza, among various other services from cardiology to orthopedics, the organization said in the Wednesday statement that “no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

The organization said the US funding has paid for the two hospitals’ “lifesaving medical care” for roughly 33,000 civilians per month. Like Bruce’s Tuesday social media posts and email to reporters, this Wednesday statement did not repeat Leavitt’s claim that there was $50 million in planned funding for condoms in particular; it provided no dollar figure at all for condoms.

**Experts expressed doubt about Leavitt’s story — or simply called it wrong**: Experts on US aid to Gaza and global health aid were baffled by the claim that the US had been planning to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza.

“We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” said Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, an aid nonprofit that has partnered with USAID on a [five-year, $50 million health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
.

Fake said this Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms” and added: “Our whole program is $50 (million) and represents a significant portion of total US aid going to Gaza.”

[Matthew Kavanagh](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/experts/matthew-m-kavanagh/)
, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said that after doing some digging into Leavitt’s claim, “It seems clear to me there was no $50 million in condoms going to Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Fact check: $50 million for condoms in Gaza? [She wrote](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
: “Example 1: Condoms. Trump’s freeze, the organization said, halts US funding for hospital services like performing about 30 lifesaving surgeries per day, delivering about 20 babies per day, running an emergency room receiving up to 200 patients per day, and operating one of Gaza’s only neonatal intensive care units and only stabilization centers for severely malnourished children.

“If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,” the organization said.

A State Department official issued an additional statement to CNN on Wednesday that asserted that the funding Trump had stopped from going to the International Medical Corps “included” funds for family planning, emergency contraceptives and prevention of sexually transmitted infections."

**WASHINGTON**

Billionaire Elon Musk backtracked Tuesday on his claim that the US had been intending to send $50 million worth of condoms to the Gaza Strip.

“First of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” Musk told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about fact-checking reports that million of dollars were actually earmarked towards the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in Gaza province of Mozambique.

“We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes," he said.

"I’m not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere. And that is really an enormous number of condoms," Musk continued.

"If it went to Mozambique instead of Gaza…okay, that's not as bad. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Analysis by [Glenn Kessler](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/glenn-kessler/)

_“DOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza. That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So, that’s what this pause is focused on, being good stewards of tax dollars.”_

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The Washington Post analysis indicates that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. However, CNN reports that the White House offered no evidence for the story, and USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. Additionally, Anadolu Agency states that Elon Musk backtracked on the claim, and a review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza.

The evidence presents conflicting information. While the Washington Post analysis suggests the claim is true, other sources contradict it. Further investigation is needed to determine the veracity of the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "$50 Million in US taxpayer money almost went to fund condoms in Gaza before DOGE cut it."

## Actions
```
web_search("US taxpayer money condoms Gaza DOGE")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN published an article on January 29, 2025, fact-checking the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence for the story, and USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. <image:k> The Washington Post published an analysis by Glenn Kessler. According to the analysis, DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. <image:1>

Anadolu Agency reports that Elon Musk backtracked on his claim that the US intended to send $50 million worth of condoms to Gaza, and a review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza. <image:k>

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The Washington Post analysis indicates that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. However, CNN reports that the White House offered no evidence for the story, and USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years. Additionally, Anadolu Agency states that Elon Musk backtracked on the claim, and a review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza.

The evidence presents conflicting information. While the Washington Post analysis suggests the claim is true, other sources contradict it. Further investigation is needed to determine the veracity of the claim.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Israel is exterminating Palestinian life in northern Gaza. 

Yet the UK refuses to condemn it.

Israel is attacking hospitals and killing health workers.

Yet the UK refuses to end all arms sales to Israel.

Israel is starving civilians and forcibly expelling them from their homes.

Yet the UK refuses to hold those responsible to account.

A UN investigation has found that Israel is committing war crimes and the crime against humanity of extermination against Palestinians. You can choose to look away, but you can never claim you didn’t know.

Starmer urges unity at home and reiterates call for ceasefire in Middle East
============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Prime minister says UK should ‘unequivocally stand with Jewish community’ and reflects on deaths in Israel

Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to “unequivocally stand with the Jewish community”, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks.

The prime minister described it as “the darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust”, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath.

While he stood firm in his commitment to help “bring the hostages home”, he said “we must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East”.

He continued: “We will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.”

His comments come as the government earlier advised [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to show “restraint”, while the prime minister had warned that “sparks” from the Middle East conflict could “light touchpapers in our communities at home”.

A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday.

In London, the Met police said [17 people had been arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/tens-of-thousands-join-pro-palestinian-protest-in-london)
 after Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a “significant” policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events.

On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London’s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. The war is deepening and it is not moving towards the peace that we need, so we are urging the steps that will take us towards that peaceful settlement”.

The prime minister, in an article [for the Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/year-of-war-has-spread-vile-hatred-in-uk-says-keir-starmer-nsc3k29jz)
, called out the “vile hatred” that had been directed towards Jews and Muslims since the 7 October attacks.

Relatives carry the bodies of their deceased loved ones wrapped in shrouds after an Israeli attack in Deir el-Balah, Gaza. Clearly there’s a detachment from the British public opinion and what the government are saying.”

The former Conservative foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said what was needed from Israelis and Palestinians was “leadership that is prepared not to forget the past, but to move on to a political dialogue”.

    ! Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 as they chanted “bring them home”.

The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been “stripped of every human right” and remains “in hell”, as she called for her safe return.

Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone’s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent.

“How is it that she \[Emily\] is still imprisoned there after one year?” Damari said.

“Why isn’t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?”

Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said “we must not forget our humanity”, adding it was “heartening” to see so many people in attendance.

“I’m here today because it’s about memorial and remembrance,” she said. There are no further scheduled charter flights, but the situation would be kept under review.

Content: "It has strongly denied allegations of genocide, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

The government is also facing calls to "urgently" recognise the state of Palestine - including from Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Jeremy Wright.

Sir Jeremy told MPs he he had changed his mind the timeframe for such a move - traditionally seen as being part of a "two-state solution" - over the rhetoric coming from the Israeli government.

'Desperately needed aid'
------------------------

During the debate, protesters gathered outside Parliament to demand the end of arms sales to Israel, something that was repeatedly echoed by MPs, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The MP, who now sits as an independent, is calling for a public inquiry to uncover what he called the "murky history of what's gone on, the murky arms sales and the complicity in appalling acts of genocide".

He has tabled a draft bill to set up an inquiry to examine the "any UK military, economic or political cooperation" with Israel, with powers to question ministers and officials.

The bill is backed by prominent left-wing Labour MPs including Diane Abbott and Richard Burgon, four independent MPs, two Greens and members of Plaid Cymru and the SNP.

It has been scheduled for debate on 4 July, but is unlikely to become law without government backing.

Corbyn was among the MPs calling for a total embargo on the sale of arms to Israel - including parts for F-35 fighter jets.

Hamish Falconer said the UK had already taken steps to "ensure that weapons directly for use in Gaza have been suspended," and had stopped supplying F-35 parts "directly to Israel".

But he said the UK would continue to supply parts to the "global pool" of F-35 spares, as this was needed to help "the defence of Nato allies" and support the Ukraine war effort.

When it was put to him that Ukraine did not use F-35s, he said the planes were needed for the redeployment of F-15s, which were used in the fight against Russia.

But Corbyn and other critics insist the government's explanations lack credibility and they must know that the parts are being used to attack Palestinians in Gaza.

The Lib Dems are also urging a tougher stance from the government on Israel.

At prime minster's questions, Sir Ed Davey urged Keir Starmer to "push at the UN Security Council for humanitarian corridors to get the desperately needed aid urgently into Gaza".

Sir Keir said that the government is "working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in".

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,607 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,335 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the territory's health ministry.

Protesters lobbied Parliament as MPs debated Gaza

Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure from some of his own MPs to take further action against Israel over what they say is a genocide in Gaza.

At prime minister's questions, Sir Keir described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire.

He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.

But his words were not enough to satisfy opposition critics and left-wing Labour MPs, who are calling on the government to take stronger action against Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers.

It comes after aid distribution centres in Gaza were closed for the day, with the Israeli military warning roads leading to the sites will be considered "combat zones".

At least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire close to a distribution centre on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.

The Israel Defence Forces say its troops fired shots after identifying suspects who moved towards them "deviating from the designated access routes".

The UK's Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer faced the anger of backbench Labour MPs - many of whom were wearing red "stop arming Israel" badges - in the House of Commons.

Falconer said he was "appalled" by Palestinians being killed when trying to access aid sites, adding: "We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account."

He added: "Israel's unjustified block on aid into Gaza needs to end - it is inhumane.

"Israel must immediately allow the United Nations and aid partners to safely deliver all types of aid at scale to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity."

Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan called for Mr Netanyahu and "the other murderous figures who are responsible" to be sanctioned.

"Words are not enough," she said, as she called for a date for when the government would impose restrictions on them.

Labour MP Paula Barker said the history books "will not be kind" to the government unless action is taken.

"What more evidence do we need to call this exactly what it is?

! A deliberate policy of annexation and genocide," she added.

Her call for the government to acknowledge that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza was echoed by a number of MPs.

Falconer said that it was a matter for a "competent court to determine".

He added that he understood their frustrations, and promised further action if the UK could not persuade the Israeli government to "change course".

Israel says it is working to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas and get back hostages they have taken."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. While Keir Starmer has commented on the situation in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and stating that Israel is exterminating Palestinians, none of the provided articles mention a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK will boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel due to its long lasting war in Gaza."

## Actions
```
web_search("Keir Starmer Israel boycott Gaza October 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a search result from map.org.uk, published on October 30, 2024, Keir Starmer stated that Israel is exterminating Palestinians in Gaza. The article does not mention any boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. ([https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza)) <image:1>

The Guardian published an article on October 6, 2024, discussing Keir Starmer's call for a ceasefire in Gaza. ([https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/06/starmer-urges-unity-at-home-and-reiterates-call-for-ceasefire-in-middle-east)) <image:1011>, <image:1012>, <image:1010> The BBC published an article on June 4, 2024, discussing the pressure on Keir Starmer to take stronger action against Israel regarding the situation in Gaza. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewd7elz749o)) <image:1023>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While Keir Starmer has commented on the situation in Gaza, including calling for a ceasefire and stating that Israel is exterminating Palestinians, none of the provided articles mention a boycott of diplomatic relations with Israel. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

BERLIN — It’s one of the most high-stakes two-round votes in the history of postwar France.

At stake is whether Marine Le Pen's National Rally party will gain an absolute majority in the National Assembly — potentially putting the far right in French government for the first time since the Vichy regime collaborated with the Nazis in World War II.

The results from the first round on Sunday were as follows:  

*   The National Rally earned 33.15%, about a third of the vote.
*   The New Popular Front — an alliance of center-left Socialists, greens and far-left parties — placed second with 28.14%.
*   President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance placed third with 20.76%.
*   Voter turnout was high at 59.39%, as of the [official count](https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/actualites/actualites-du-ministere/legislatives-2024-taux-de-participation)
     at 5 p.m. If it does, Le Pen wants the party's 28-year-old president, Jordan Bardella, to become prime minister.

Speaking to cameras after first-round results came in Sunday evening, Bardella [pledged to be](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/07/01/bardella-pledges-to-be-prime-minister-for-all-french-people-after-topping-election-results)

### Other countries are watching very closely

Meanwhile, other countries are watching events in France — many with alarm, though some who support nationalist populists are encouraged by the result.

The Belgian _Le Soir_ newspaper [slams Macron](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/01/french-snap-elections-foreign-media-acknowledges-the-end-of-the-macron-era_6676347_4.html)
 as "a president who, far from protecting his country against the far right for good, has legitimized it by abandoning the ballot box to it." German newsmagazine _Der Spiegel_ [asks](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/frankreich-warum-liefert-emmanuel-macron-das-land-den-rechtsradikalen-aus-a-a71e4e0d-e0d8-471a-930a-85695bf89867)
: “Why is Emmanuel Macron handing the country over to the far right?”

In Ukraine, the most-read article in _Ukrainskaya Pravda_ newspaper was a news item on the election, which ends on a note of [concern](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/06/30/7463380/)
: “The National Rally’s position on the Russian-Ukrainian war remains unknown. While the party currently claims it will assist Ukraine in defending itself against Russian forces, it has also established red lines, such as not giving Ukraine long-range weaponry.”

Hundreds of candidates on the left and center of French politics pulled out of the contest to avoid splitting the anti-Le Pen vote.

Their initial aim was to stop Le Pen’s party winning an outright majority, which seemed a likely outcome a week ago. The president’s office said he would reflect on the results before taking “the necessary decisions.”

Attal, Macron’s choice as the current French prime minister, said Sunday that he would offer to resign, but he opened the door to heading a caretaker government during the Paris Olympic Games, which begin on July 26. [Skip to main content](#main)

PARIS  —  The left-wing alliance in France won the most seats in parliament in a dramatic election, dealing a surprise blow to the far-right party of Marine Le Pen.

In the first round of voting a week ago Le Pen’s National Rally came top and was aiming to secure the most seats in France’s legislature for the first time in the party’s history on Sunday. “\[We\] wrested a result that everyone said was impossible in a wonderful leap of civic spirit … The people have avoided the worst,” he said.

After the first round of voting on June 30, Le Pen’s party was [on course for its best ever election result](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-legislative-election-results-first-round-marine-le-pen-pollsters-national-rally/)
 and a majority in parliament.

### Macron and Mélenchon worked to stop Le Pen

But frantic political maneuvering in the days that followed saw Macron’s team and leaders of parties on the left muster their forces in a national effort to thwart the far right. Instead their efforts handed the initiative to the other side of French politics, the left.

Attention will turn to who could become France’s next prime minister. It is ready,” said Mélenchon, who leads the radical France Unbowed party.

### Bardella slams ‘unnatural alliance’

As his ecstatic supporters chanted “We won!”, Mélenchon said the New Popular Front would seek to implement its manifesto, including revoking Macron’s controversial pensions reforms and introducing big hikes in the minimum wage.

By contrast, the mood at the National Rally election event in the east of the city was grim. Angry Le Pen supporters booed Mélenchon when his speech was shown on TV screens. At a gathering of his political allies, the French president galvanized his troops: “Our ideas are still alive and \[we\] haven’t lost voters,” he claimed, according to one participant who spoke to Paris Playbook.

Macron’s own position as president was not at stake: He is due to remain in office until 2027."

_The Economist_ is tracking the contest. This manoeuvre, common in French elections, significantly reduced the RN’s chances of securing a majority. An estimate by the French Interior Ministry at 5pm local time suggests that 59.7% of people voted—up from 59.39% at the same time in the first round and 38.11% in 2022.

The New Popular Front (NFP) is a newly formed alliance of left-wing parties. In 2022 it came fifth in the first round of the parliamentary elections.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in France, and the image search results confirm pro-Palestine protests in France. The web search indicates that the 2024 French parliamentary elections took place, with Marine Le Pen's party gaining a strong lead in the first round, but the left-wing alliance won the most seats overall.

The claim states that the image shows the "French" Left rioting against Le Pen's victory. However, the image search results show pro-Palestine protests in France. The image itself contains Palestinian flags and signs. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. It is more likely that the image depicts a pro-Palestine protest in France, not necessarily a riot against Le Pen's victory.

The evidence does not provide enough information to determine the exact nature of the protest in the image, such as the specific reasons for the protest or the political affiliations of the participants.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The RN did not secure a majority. <image:9472> and <image:20>


### Evidence from `image_search`
Al Jazeera published an article about a pro-Palestinian protest in Paris, with an image showing the Eiffel Tower in the background (<image:9505>). Reuters reported on a French court upholding a government ban on pro-Palestine protests, including an image of a pro-Palestine protest in France (<image:9506>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was likely taken in France, and the image search results confirm pro-Palestine protests in France. The web search indicates that the 2024 French parliamentary elections took place, with Marine Le Pen's party gaining a strong lead in the first round, but the left-wing alliance won the most seats overall.

The claim states that the image shows the "French" Left rioting against Le Pen's victory. However, the image search results show pro-Palestine protests in France. The image itself contains Palestinian flags and signs. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. It is more likely that the image depicts a pro-Palestine protest in France, not necessarily a riot against Le Pen's victory.

The evidence does not provide enough information to determine the exact nature of the protest in the image, such as the specific reasons for the protest or the political affiliations of the participants.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image likely depicts a pro-Palestine protest in France, as indicated by the presence of Palestinian flags and the geolocation results. While the 2024 French parliamentary elections did take place, with Marine Le Pen's party gaining a lead, the evidence does not support the claim that the image shows a riot against her victory. The image search results show pro-Palestine protests in France, not necessarily a riot against Le Pen's victory. Therefore, the claim is false.

> **Claim:** Photo showing China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games, which was inspired by the Palestinian flag.
> 
> **Fact:** This viral photo was featured in a 2023 issue of Vogue China magazine and does not show China’s Olympic uniform for the 2024 Olympic Games. China’s uniform for the Paris Olympics features red and white colors. According to reports, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed support for Palestinians on several occasions, pledging additional humanitarian aid to Gaza and condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories ([here](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-asks-world-court-speak-out-unlawful-israeli-occupation-2024-02-22/)

).

To sum up, an old photo from Vogue China magazine is being falsely shared as showing Chinese athletes wearing the colours of the Palestinian flag.

[!Factly <image:6148>](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va1Lh751SWssBut3q81s)

Share. The Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games feature 329 events in 32 sports. From this, it is clear that the photo has no connection with Palestine or the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The comments came during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where Trump aired a long list of complaints about a wide range of issues, ranging from President Biden's new ban on offshore drilling, to his various legal cases, to the Panama Canal.

Negotiations between Hamas and Israel are ongoing in Qatar, with Hamas this week [naming 34 hostages](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/06/g-s1-41220/israel-hamas-hostage-negotiations)
 in Gaza — including two dual U.S. citizens — it would be willing to release in a ceasefire deal.

Steve Witcoff, Trump's envoy to the Middle East, joined Trump briefly and told reporters that "we're making a lot of progress" in trying to free hostages held by Hamas, and that he was "really hopeful that by the inaugural we'll have some good things to announce."

Trump would not elaborate on what he meant by his threat — first announced [on social media in early December](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113584730902816413)
 — that "all hell will break out" if a deal is not made.

"It will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone," Trump said.

![U.S. I don’t have to say anymore, but that’s what it is,” Trump said in remarks at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Tuesday, adding that “there should have never been” the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel.

Steve Witkoff, Trump’s pick to serve as the special envoy to the Middle East, struck an optimistic note about the state of negotiations to reach a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would secure the release of the hostages, saying negotiators are “making a lot of progress.”

“It’s the president, his reputation, the things that he has said that are driving this negotiation, and so hopefully it’ll all work out and we’ll save some lives,” Witkoff added. January 7, 2025.

U.S. January 7, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump makes remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. CNN has previously reported that Biden administration officials are taking the lead in the talks, while their incoming Trump counterparts are being closely updated on developments.

But a senior Biden administration official struck a much more cautious tone following Trump and Witkoff’s comments, telling CNN that the negotiations remain “difficult.”

The official – who declined to comment further on the status of the talks – insisted that despite Witkoff appearing to suggest that a deal before January 20 was realistic, the talks are challenging. The first ceasefire – weeks after the October 7 attack – saw the release of dozens of hostages, but subsequent efforts to pause the fighting and secure the release of additional hostages have gone nowhere.

Witkoff told reporters he expected to travel back to Doha, Qatar, on Wednesday."

Content: "The assault was launched after Hamas fighters stormed Israeli territory in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israeli military strikes killed at least 24 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said, as the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory urged international donors to immediately provide fuel to run generators and maintain medical services.

One of those strikes killed four people in a house in Gaza City and six were killed in separate strikes across the enclave, medics said.

Later on Tuesday, an Israeli strike on a tent in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip killed four children and eight Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a house in Jabalia in the north, medics said.

Additionally, an Israeli strike on a car in Khan Younis killed two people, medics and civil emergency service officials said.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those strikes.

It said [240 Palestinians](/world/middle-east/israel-detains-medics-after-hospital-raid-health-officials-say-2024-12-28/)
 its forces had detained in a raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza last month had provided "substantial intelligence".

The military released footage of the interrogation of a purported Hamas militant who detailed how militants "operated from the hospital area" and transferred weapons to and from it.

Hamas and the Gaza health ministry deny any armed presence at the hospital.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hamas stood by its demand on Tuesday that Israel fully end its assault on Gaza under any deal to release hostages, and said U.S. 20 inauguration.

Officials from the Islamist group and Israel have been holding talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in the most intensive effort for months to reach a ceasefire [in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)

The outgoing U.S. administration has called for a final push for a deal before Joe Biden leaves office, and many in the region now view [Trump's inauguration](https://www.reuters.com/topic/person/donald-trump/)
 as an unofficial deadline.

But with the clock ticking, both sides accuse the other of blocking a deal by adhering to conditions that torpedoed all previous peace efforts for more than a year.

Hamas says it will free its remaining hostages only if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw all its troops from Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office did not comment.

In one notable step towards a deal, a Hamas official told Reuters on Sunday the group had [cleared a list](/world/middle-east/blinken-calls-push-get-gaza-truce-deal-over-finish-line-2025-01-06/)
 submitted by Israel of 34 hostages who could be freed in the initial phase of a truce, alongside Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

The list included female Israeli soldiers, plus elderly, female and minor-aged civilians. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

**\[1/3\]**A woman walks past posters of hostages kidnapped during the deadly October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, in Tel Aviv, Israel, December 16, 2024. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are free.

"Hamas is the only obstacle to the release of the hostages," the director general of Israel's foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, told a briefing with reporters, saying Israel was fully committed to reaching a deal.

Hamas official Osama Hamdan, who held a news conference in Algiers, said Israel was to blame for undermining all efforts to reach a deal.

While he said he would not give details about the latest round of negotiations, he reiterated the Hamas conditions of "a complete end to the aggression and a full withdrawal from lands the occupation invaded".

Commenting on Trump's threat that there would be "hell to pay" unless all hostages were freed before the inauguration, Hamdan said: "I think the U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was rash to say there would be "hell to pay" unless they go free by his Jan. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had so far received no confirmation about whether those on its list were still alive.

Content: "Except courage, courage is made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — André Fran (@andrefran) [October 22, 2023](https://twitter.com/andrefran/status/1716203264440467498?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

While it's entirely possible that Bourdain might have agreed with the words in the quote, we have so far been unable to find any credible record of him ever having made this exact statement.

Bourdain [died by suicide](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-asia-argento-last-texts-down-and-out-in-paradise-excerpt/)
 in June 2018 in France, reportedly [hanging himself](https://people.com/food/anthony-bourdain-death-no-evidence-foul-play-violence-report/)
 in his hotel room. We'll also take a look back at the fact that Bourdain had visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza for an episode of his CNN show, which resulted in several noteworthy comments and tweets he made in regard to Palestinians.

A Quote Misattributed
---------------------

The oldest version of the quote that we could find with Bourdain's name attached to it was from July 2021.

> “Today nearly everything is made in China-except for courage, it’s made in Palestine.” - Anthony Bourdain
> 
> — Rama Al Malah (@MalahRama) [July 25, 2021](https://twitter.com/MalahRama/status/1419149132053221381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Meanwhile, we found similar statements going back to 2013 that did not mention Bourdain, showing that his name had been misattributed with the quote.

> "Today nearly everything is made in China...except for courage- it's made in Palestine." [pic.twitter.com/zdnMsjEH4g](https://t.co/zdnMsjEH4g)
>

> Today almost everything is made in China!... [#psychicpowers](https://twitter.com/hashtag/psychicpowers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

The episode included several key moments of narration from Bourdain that helped to shed light on what his thoughts _might_ be if he were still alive and asked about the "courage is made in Palestine" quote.

During the episode, upon entering a Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza, Bourdain referred to the territory as being "a prison":

!Anthony Bourdain was purported to have said the words today nearly everything is made in China except for courage which is made in Palestine. However, as we've noted below, Bourdain did have a record of making several remarks on the subject of Israel and Gaza, including comments and tweets specifically about Palestinians.

 Clifford May, the founder and president of FDD.

Khalidi told the [_New York Post_](https://nypost.com/2024/11/29/us-news/biden-picks-up-anti-israel-book-during-black-friday-shopping-4-years-too-late-says-author/)
, “I do not speak to the _Post_ (or the _Times_ for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late.” (The _Post_ noted it “did not offer or agree to any terms conditioning that response as off the record or on background.”

Dumisani Washington, founder and CEO of the Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DumisaniTemsgen/status/1862727604458938552)
 that Biden appearing with the book suggests that the president is not a friend of Jews and Israel.

“Elections matter,” [wrote](https://twitter.com/AdamMossoff/status/1862728873093263589)
 Adam Mossoff, a law professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School. Never forget the gaslighting by the Biden-Harris administration over the past year, and especially by Kamala Harris who periodically dropped her mask and did reveal her true beliefs.”

**‘The double pander continues’**

In a 2020 review of the work in question in _Jewish Review of Books_, the Israeli historian Benny Morris noted that Khalidi has downplayed his PLO connection in the past.

The book “turns out to be yet another somewhat turgid recitation of the traditional Palestinian narrative, its mantras being Western and Zionist guilt for everything that has befallen the Palestinians and a passionate, personal assertion of Palestinian innocence,” Morris [wrote](https://jewishreviewofbooks.com/articles/7210/the-war-on-history/#)
. 

“Khalidi’s bottom line is that Zionism is a ‘colonialist’ enterprise, a doctrine enunciated in the Palestine National Charter of 1964,” he added. “It’s absolutely worthless.”

Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum, [wrote](https://twitter.com/DanielPipes/status/1862849729689702594)
 that Biden said on Nov. 29, “Biden picks up _The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine_” by “former PLO spokesman and anti-Zionist fanatic Rashid Khalidi.”

“The double pander continues right up to Jan."

US President Joe Biden was spotted yesterday leaving a bookstore in Nantucket, Massachusetts holding Arab-American academic Rashid Khalidi’s “The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine.”

The book presents itself as “a history of settler colonialism and resistance from 1917 to 2017.”

Khalidi has argued that Palestinians living under Israeli military rule have a legal right to resistance and that supporters of Israel use McCarthyite tactics to silence debate in America.

Asked by the New York Post his thoughts on Biden picking up his book, Khalidi responds that it was “four years too late.”

Many Arab Americans who typically voted for Democratic candidates in presidential elections shifted their support to Donald Trump in this month’s election due to anger over Biden’s support for Israel in the war against Hamas.

Is The Times of Israel important to you?

If so, we have a request. 

Every day, even during war, our journalists keep you abreast of the most important developments that merit your attention."

[President Biden](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden)
 on Friday picked up a copy of a book that described Israel as a colonial power in the face of Palestinian resistance despite his repeated support for the Jewish state. 

Biden was spotted by the press leaving Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917-2017" by Columbia University professor emeritus Rashid Khalidi, the New York Post reported. 

"I do not speak to the Post (or the Times for that matter), so this is not for publication, but my reaction is that this is four years too late," Khalidi told the Post of Biden holding his book. 

The newspaper noted it did not agree to any terms conditioning [Khalidi's response](https://www.foxnews.com/media)

In the book, Khalidi wrote about Israel's alleged discriminatory policies against Palestinians.

"Settler-colonial confrontations with indigenous peoples have only ended in one of three ways: with the elimination of full subjugation of the native population, as in North America; with the defeat and expulsion of the colonizer, as in Algeria, which is extremely rare; or with the abandonment of colonial supremacy, in the context of compromise and reconciliation, as in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Ireland," he wrote.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Khalidi and the White House.

The [book argues](https://www.zinnedproject.org/materials/hundred-years-war-on-palestine/)
 that "the modern history of Palestine can best be understood in these terms: as a colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people against their will." 

It was not clear if Biden purchased the book or if it was given to him.

Biden has repeatedly declared his support for Israel but has been criticized by Israeli supporters for putting conditions on U.S. Biden has also reportedly criticized his Israeli counterpart behind closed doors, the Post reported.

From [Source](https://nypost.com/2024/12/09/world-news/greta-thunberg-bursts-into-laughter-as-she-declares-f-k-israel-at-rally/): 
Content: "Climate activist Greta Thunberg was filmed giggling as she declared “f–k Germany” and “f–k Israel” at an anti-Israel rally in Germany Friday, video shows.

The 21-year-old appeared as a speaker at the demonstration in the southwestern German city of Mannheim, which included a discussion focused on “solidarity with Palestine and the climate movement.”

“F–k Germany,” [Thunberg says in the clip](https://x.com/StopAntisemites/status/1865513089656840246)
, before bursting into laughter. “And f–k Israel,” she adds to rapturous applause and whistling from the crowd.

A city spokesperson [told German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur](https://www.yahoo.com/news/greta-thunberg-attends-pro-palestine-062727591.html)
 that 700 protesters attended the rally, which they described as peaceful.

Thunberg, however, has faced fierce backlash for the comments since the clip was shared on social media.

 [!Greta Thunberg smiling to camera and holding her hat <image:392> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

Thunberg’s speech at the rally in the main market square of Mannheim sparked backlash from supporters of Israel. ZUMAPRESS.com

Manuel Hagel, a conservative leader in a regional parliament, slammed the inflammatory language, [the Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-832423)
 reported.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanizing positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” Hagel seethed, according to the outlet.

Advocacy group StopAntisemitism blasted the young activist as a “Hamas shill” in a post that had been viewed more than 70,000 times on X early Monday afternoon.

“Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear… someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving climate challenges,” the group wrote.

 [!Thunberg speaking behind podium <image:393> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

The rally was a peaceful gathering of 700 people, according to city officials. The climate activist [was named “Antisemite of the Week” by StopAntisemitism](https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/greta-thunberg-named-antisemite-of-the-week-by-jewish-advocacy-group/)
 following her arrest at a rally in September — and is in the running for the group’s “Antisemite of the Year.”

Thunberg was arrested on Sept. 4 while protesting with the group Students Against the Occupation, which called on Copenhagen University to cease all connections with Israel, including putting an end to several cross-university student programs.

She posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza” just days after Oct. 7, alongside a toy octopus — which some read as an allusion to the Nazis’ antisemitic propaganda visualizing Judaism’s supposed network of control over the world.

 [!Greta Thunberg with group of protesters. Getty Images

Thunberg, who is on the autism spectrum, later removed the photo and [claimed she was “completely unaware”](https://nypost.com/2023/10/20/greta-thunberg-posts-pro-palestinian-pic-with-antisemitic-trope/)
 of the historical use of antisemitic octopus imagery and clarified that she meant for it to represent her emotions.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” she said. Getty Images

A slew of Jewish state supporters also took to X to ask, “Why has she ever been relevant?” and called the incident “nasty.”

“She’s lost the plot entirely,” one critic declared.

This wouldn’t be the first time Thunberg has come under fire for hateful comments. <image:394> 3](# "Open a slideshow of all 3 article images.")

Thunberg has faced backlash since October 7, when she began openly supporting the Palestinians."

[Greta Thunberg](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/02/03/greta-thunberg-ruffian-masquerading-as-latter-day-saint/)
 has been accused of being a “Hamas shill” after footage of the [climate change activist](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/05/12/queen-greta-has-exposed-the-truth-about-the-green-movement/)
 declaring “f--- Israel” at a rally emerged.

Ms Thunberg, 21, was speaking during a discussion on “solidarity with [Palestine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/12/04/giant-anti-israel-banner-unfurled-outside-parliament/)
 and the climate movement” at a demonstration in the German city of Mannheim on Friday.

“F--- Germany,” Ms Thunberg said in the clip before laughing. “[And f--- Israel](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/27/greta-thunbergs-climate-movement-demonises-israel/)
,” she added, as the crowd applauded.

The footage has been widely shared online and has led to fierce criticism of Ms Thunberg.

Manuel Hagel, a centre-Right member of the local state parliament, said she was “moving very consciously in close proximity to anti-Semitism”.

“Mannheim does not need a platform for such dehumanising positions and our country does not need the presence of people like Greta Thunberg,” the CDU lawmaker told the Jerusalem Post.

A spokesman for the city said more than 700 people attended the peaceful demonstration.

StopAntisemitism, an American campaign group, wrote in a social media post, viewed over 73,000 times: “Climate activist turned Hamas shill Greta Thunberg has made her stance crystal clear.

“Someone should remind Greta that Israel is a global leader in solving the climate challenge.”

The group has put Ms Thunberg in the running for its “anti-Semite of the year” award, which is open to public vote.

The [Greta Thunberg Foundation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/greta-thunberg-16-year-old-activist-every-leader-planet-wants/)
 was asked for comment but did not immediately respond.

Germany is one of Israel’s staunchest supporters in Europe, which is a legacy of the Holocaust under the Nazi regime.

The German branch of the Fridays for Future climate movement, which began after the then 15-year-old Ms Thunberg’s school strikes protests, has already distanced itself from the Swedish activist.

It came after Ms Thunberg spoke at a climate protest in Amsterdam in November last year. But that does not justify disinformation.”

Ms Thunberg, who is Swedish, was arrested on Sept 4 while protesting with a group calling on Copenhagen University to cut all ties with Israel.

Days after the October 7 terror attacks, she posted a photo of herself holding a sign reading “Stand with Gaza”.

Ms Thunberg, who is autistic, was pictured with a toy octopus, which some interpreted as a reference to Nazi propaganda accusing Jews of controlling the world.

“The toy in the picture is a tool often used by autistic people as a way to communicate feelings,” Ms Thunberg said, after insisting she was “completely unaware” of the historical use of octopus imagery in anti-Semitic propaganda. Wearing a Palestinian black and white scarf, she urged “ceasefire now”.

Luisa Neubauer, the head of the German chapter of the Fridays for Future movement, said at the time: “It is obvious that for many global organisations, global realities diverge when it comes to Israel and Palestine."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg declared "f–k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Germany. However, the evidence does not show Thunberg holding a sign that reads "Fuck Israel." The provided evidence includes images of Thunberg at the rally, but none of them show her holding a sign with the specific phrase.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### After the Boomtown Rats

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: After the Boomtown Rats")\
\]

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg/250px-Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)](/wiki/File:Bob_Geldof_Rock_am_Ring_1987.jpg)

Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[5\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-5)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[25\]](#cite_note-25)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[26\]](#cite_note-26)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[38\]](#cite_note-38)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[46\]](#cite_note-46)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-47)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[48\]](#cite_note-48)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[63\]](#cite_note-63)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[104\]](#cite_note-104)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[105\]](#cite_note-105)

### Fathers' rights

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fathers' rights")\
\]

From January 2002 until sometime in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to [Father's Rights](/wiki/Father%27s_Rights "Father's Rights")
 campaigners; it was reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[130\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-130)
[\[131\]](#cite_note-Hand-131)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
[\[135\]](#cite_note-135)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[136\]](#cite_note-136)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)
[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
[\[132\]](#cite_note-auto-132)
 As of 2019, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence Geldof.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto3-137)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

The 1985 fundraising concert was famously conceived by Geldof after he was moved and angered by images of people starving to death in Ethiopia. I’d have no problem saying it to them if I met them.”

Claim: "In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army."

## Actions
```
web_search("U2 Bob Geldof tour Israeli army November 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia page for Bob Geldof mentions his work with U2's Bono for debt relief in developing countries and that in November 2014, Geldof announced a new Band Aid project. <image:k> The Dublin Live article, published on November 3, 2024, discusses Mary Coughlan criticizing Bono and Bob Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.

*   [https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects.
2.  The Dublin Live article from November 2024 shows that Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. The evidence suggests the opposite, with criticism of their silence on the situation in Gaza.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects, and there is criticism of their silence on the situation in Gaza. There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects, there is no evidence of a 2024 tour to aid the Israeli army. In fact, a November 2024 article from Dublin Live ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)) indicates criticism of their silence on the situation in Gaza.

After passengers on a recent Air Canada flight discovered that Israel had been removed from the in-flight interactive map and relabeled as the Palestinian Territories, the Canadian flag carrier says that the change is the result of a “display issue.”

“Air Canada has been made aware of a display issue with the interactive map on the IFE systems of its B737 aircraft,” it says in response to an image posted on X of the altered flight map.

“The issue has affected other carriers using the same system and we are working with the third-party provider on a remedy,” it adds.

Last September, passengers noticed a similar change had been made to the interactive maps aboard a JetBlue flight. The airline similarly said that the map had been provided by a third party company, and decided “after a careful review” to switch to a new map vendor.

![a plane flying over a map](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jetblue-Palestinian-map-9sep24.png)

JetBlue has been forced to make changes to its inflight maps and has dumped its current vendor of the popular passenger amenity after Jewish customers noticed that the State of Israel had been obliterated by a much larger place label describing the entire country as the ‘Palestinian Territories.’

Although JetBlue doesn’t even fly anywhere near Israel, JetBlue’s inflight map still has global coverage, and at least one passenger discovered the apparent snub to Israel.

The mistake then quickly went viral and JetBlue responded by launching a review into its third-party inflight map vendor. Always keeping an ear close to the ground, Matt's industry insights, analysis and news coverage is frequently relied upon by some of the biggest names in journalism.

In the meantime, JetBlue said it would find a new map vendor to ensure that inflight maps reflected the place naming convention recommended by the US government.

“We’re sorry for the concern this has caused. We can assure you that no one on the JetBlue team was involved with drawing or labeling the map of the region and we were not previously aware of the issue,” a spokesperson for the airline told an Israeli media outlet on Sunday.

The statement from the airline continued: “After a careful review, we have decided to switch to a new map vendor. When he went to fly home with JetBlue, however, he discovered that JetBlue had canceled his ticket.

In the wake of the controversy, JetBlue [accelerated its ongoing uniform review](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/05/11/jetblue-bans-flight-attendants-from-wearing-free-palestine-flag-pins-after-altercation-with-jewish-passenger/)
 and quickly decided that customer-facing staff can only wear pin badges for countries or territories that the airline currently serves.

Several months after JetBlue’s pin badge review, Delta Air Lines also decided to ban staffers from wearing Palestine badges after accusations of antisemitism when a flight attendant was spotted wearing one of the badges.

It was initially reported that the flight attendant was breaking Delta’s uniform policy but it quickly transpired that the crew member wasn’t doing anything wrong.

Delta has, however, [now banned flight attendants from wearing Palestine pin badges](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/07/12/delta-air-changes-uniform-policy-in-the-wake-of-palestine-flag-pin-furore-that-has-left-airline-on-back-foot/)
 – a decision that angered the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA) which is currently trying to unionize Delta’s crew members.

Last month, however, United Airlines [decided not intervene](https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/2024/08/29/united-airlines-refuses-to-back-down-in-decision-to-allow-flight-attendants-to-wear-palestine-flag-pins-despite-accusations-of-antisemitism/)
 when some passengers complained about seeing flight attendants wearing Palestine pin badges.

In a statement, the airline said its long-standing policy of allowing employees to wear flag pins that either designate a language they speak or which represent “pride in a place to which they may have a special connection” would remain in force.

That means that Palestine pin badges continue to be an option for United flight attendants to wear.

! We are making these changes as quickly as the technology allows.”

In May, JetBlue said it would ban flight attendants and other customer-facing staff from wearing ‘Free Palestine’ pin badges after a Jewish customer accused the airline of antisemitism following a run-in with a crew member who was wearing the controversial pin badge.

Paul Faust, 54, was flying with JetBlue on a flight from Fort Lauderdale when he noticed a flight attendant wearing a ‘Free Palestine’ pin badge and decided to approach one of her colleagues to explain that Jewish passengers could find the badge offensive.

Faust says he thought the matter was over after expressing his opinion, but upon landing, he discovered that the airline had called the cops on him.

When Faust deboarded, the cops hadn’t yet arrived so he didn’t wait around but thought the matter was over. While our content provider works on making this transition, we have also asked the current vendor to adjust our onboard map so that it aligns with the U.S. <image:5310>

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:30> This image shows Jet Blue Airlines' in-flight map where Israel's borders were inaccurate and the area was shown under the label 'Palestinian Territories'. The indicent occured in September 2024."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported that JetBlue Airways changed Israel's borders and name to "Palestinian Territories" on its in-flight map, sparking outrage. The incident occurred in September 2024, and the airline stated that the map was provided by a third-party company. (<image:1>)

Similar changes were noticed on a JetBlue flight, as reported by The Times of Israel. Another article from paddleyourownkanoo.com, published on September 9, 2024, also discusses the controversy. JetBlue was forced to change its in-flight maps and switch map vendors. (<image:5308>, <image:5309>)


### Evidence from `image_search`

Content: The search result from Ynetnews.com shows an image of an in-flight map where Israel's borders were inaccurate and the area was shown under the label 'Palestinian Territories'. <image:9551>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that JetBlue Airways displayed an inaccurate in-flight map in September 2024, mislabeling Israel as "Palestinian Territories." The Jerusalem Post and The Times of Israel reported on the incident, and JetBlue attributed the error to a third-party provider. The airline subsequently changed its maps and vendors.

Late last month, Netanyahu visited the U.S. and met President Joe Biden, Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and Republican former President Trump.

Egypt, the United States and Qatar have scheduled a new round of [Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 ceasefire negotiations for Thursday.

Biden laid out a three-phase [ceasefire proposal](/world/middle-east/whats-new-israel-ceasefire-proposal-biden-announced-2024-05-31/)

One source told Axios Trump's call was intended to encourage Netanyahu to take the deal, but stressed he did not know if this is indeed what the former president told Netanyahu. Washington and regional mediators have since tried arranging the Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal but have run into repeated obstacles.

Hamas said on Wednesday it would not take part in a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks slated for Thursday in Qatar, but an official briefed on the talks said mediators expected to consult with the Palestinian Islamist group afterwards.

Washington, Israel's most important ally, has said that a ceasefire in Gaza will reduce the rising threat of a wider war in the Middle East.

There has been an increased risk of a broader war after the recent killings of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/world/middle-east/obituary-tough-talking-haniyeh-was-seen-more-moderate-face-hamas-2024-07-31/)

  !People look for salvageable items following an Israeli raid in al-Mawasi area in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip, on June 29. <image:4093>

Protesters hold signs and smoke torches during a demonstration calling for an hostages deal and against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government on August 10. It started after a surprise Hamas-led attack on Israel last October killed around 1,200 people.

This round of talks is based on a three-phase proposal that [President Biden laid out](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/31/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-middle-east-2/)
 in a national address on May 31 calling for a cease-fire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners and detainees and the reconstruction of Gaza. But [_The New York Times_ reported Tuesday](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-cease-fire-talks.html)
 that documents show that Netanyahu has been inflexible in recent talks, adding new conditions to his demands. Netanyahu has denied that report.

Last week, the mediating parties called for an “urgent” new round of talks, in an attempt to kickstart stalled negotiations.

“There is no further time to waste nor excuses from any party for further delay,” a [statement from the mediators said.](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
 “It is time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire, and implement this agreement.”  

### What will these talks look like?

The talks will take place in Doha, Qatar, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. has suggested, the temporary cease-fire would become permanent.

  !Protesters in Israel call for a hostage deal and demonstrate against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Aug. The two sides remain far apart on several issues.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Hamas for obstructing negotiations. Hamas instead wants a guaranteed end to the war.

There are other disagreements yet to be resolved, including whether Israel can screen Palestinian civilians returning to north Gaza to block armed militants, the number of Israeli hostages still alive to be released, the number and identities of Palestinian prisoners and detainees to be released, and who will have control over the Philadelphi Corridor — a strip of land along Gaza’s border with Egypt that Israel took control of in its May offensive into Rafah.

The mediating parties have downplayed these differences, calling them “[only the details of implementation](https://il.usembassy.gov/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-states-egypt-and-qatar/)
,” and said they are ready with a final proposal bridging the remaining issues, if necessary. Accessibility links

Vice President Kamala Harris and Israel: A Record of Complicity, Not Change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* * *

! <image:1552>

By: Melissa Garriga 

Vice President Kamala Harris has often been portrayed as a more sympathetic figure toward the plight of Palestinians, a leader who might offer a nuanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Harris has accepted over half a million dollars from the pro-Israel lobby, and her actions, along with those of President Biden, underscore the administration's unwavering support for Israel's ongoing occupation and brutal campaign in Palestine. Harris has tried to strategically position herself as distinct from President Biden on Israel's genocide campaign in Gaza, calling for a ceasefire "for at least six weeks" in March 2024. The world is watching, and history will judge her accordingly.**_

_Melissa Garriga is the communications and media relations manager for CODEPINK. JDCA CEO Halie Soifer reminisced about Harris' 2017 trip to Israel, highlighting her "deep commitment to Israel's security and strong ties to the Jewish community." This trip, however, should not be romanticized—it was a clear signal of Harris's alignment with the pro-Israel lobby, a relationship that has only deepened over the years.

Harris's recent actions further illustrate her troubling stance. This selective outrage is not only hypocritical but also reveals a disturbing willingness to ignore atrocities committed by Israel while amplifying unsubstantiated claims against its Palestinians.

The [Jewish Current's 2020 article on Harris's ties to the AIPAC lobby group](https://jewishcurrents.org/restoring-the-bipartisan-consensus)
 paints an even clearer picture. Even when grassroots pressure mounted for Democratic candidates to distance themselves from AIPAC in 2019, Harris quietly met with AIPAC leaders, reaffirming her commitment to a strong U.S.-Israel alliance and combating anti-Semitism. When asked whether Israel meets international standards of human rights, Harris's response was a resounding "Overall, yes," a statement that starkly contrasts with the reality of Israel's human rights abuses.

The Vice President's stories of planting trees in Israel as a child are particularly tone-deaf."

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to stick largely to Joe Biden's foreign policy playbook on key issues such as [Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/ukraine-crisis/)

The [Kremlin](/world/biden-kremlin-says-ukraine-war-is-more-important-2024-07-22/)
 said on Monday that Harris had made no noteworthy contribution to relations with Moscow except for statements "unfriendly towards our country." She has accused Russia of waging a "barbaric and inhumane" war in Ukraine.

On China, Harris has long positioned herself within Washington's bipartisan mainstream on the need for the U.S. 7, she has at times stepped out slightly ahead of the president in criticizing Israel's military approach.

In March, she [bluntly stated that Israel](/world/us-vp-harris-urges-israeli-government-do-more-boost-aid-into-gaza-2024-03-03/)
 was not doing enough to ease a "humanitarian catastrophe" during its ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave. policy toward Israel, Washington's closest ally in the Middle East.

Halie Soifer, who served as national security adviser to Harris during the then-senator's first two years in Congress, said Harris' support of Israel has been just as strong as Biden's. Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania <image:1560>

U.S. Harris was tasked at the start of his term with addressing the root causes of high irregular migration, and Republicans have sought to make her the face of the problem.

On a range of global priorities, said analysts, a Harris presidency would resemble a second Biden administration.

"She may be a more energetic player but one thing you shouldn't expect – any immediate big shifts in the substance of Biden's foreign policy," said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations.

Harris has signaled, for instance, that she would not deviate from Biden's staunch support for NATO and would continue backing Ukraine in its fight against Russia. On a tour of the Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea in September 2022 to reassert Washington's support for Seoul, she mistakenly touted a U.S. "alliance with the Republic of North Korea."

If Harris becomes her party's standard-bearer and can overcome Trump's lead in pre-election opinion polls to win the White House, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would rank high on her agenda, especially if the Gaza war is still raging.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas militants carried out a deadly cross-border raid on Oct."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tougher-tone-israel-steady-nato-how-harris-foreign-policy-could-look-2024-07-21/)) published an article on July 21, 2024, stating that Harris's support for Israel has been as strong as Biden's <image:1560>.

USA TODAY published an article on July 23, 2024, discussing Kamala Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, including her call for a cease-fire and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris's support for Israel is a consistent theme. The Reuters article from July 21, 2024, indicates her support is as strong as Biden's. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, further supports this, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that Kamala Harris made the exact statement "Our support for Israel will continue" on July 22, 2024, during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit. The boughtbyzionism.org website mentions an endorsement on that date, but it does not provide a direct quote.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence. Additional information, such as a direct quote or a news report confirming the statement, is needed.

WASHINGTON, DC – JULY 25: U.S. (Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday afternoon, a day after he vowed to Congress that he wants “total victory” in the deadly Gaza war.

Harris said she and Netanyahu had a “constructive” meeting and that she expressed to the prime minister “serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza.” Harris also said she stands by a two-state solution for the region as the “only path” to peace.

“I’ve said it many times, but it bears repeating: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said during remarks from the White House following the meeting.

“What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. But for the foreseeable future, we must retain overriding security control there to prevent the resurgence of terror, to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.”

Israel’s parliament [voted](https://main.knesset.gov.il/EN/News/PressReleases/Pages/press18724w.aspx)
 overwhelmingly on July 18 to disapprove of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, bucking Biden’s longstanding advocacy for a two-state solution in the region.

Netanyahu’s meeting with Harris followed his afternoon meeting with Biden separately, and both then met with the families of hostages still held captive by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.

#### Harris appeals to protesters

Seemingly in reference to the uprising of protests across the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Netanyahu also met with U.S. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent,” she said.

Harris said there has been “hopeful movement” for a cease-fire deal that includes the release of all hostages and a phased withdrawal of the Israeli military.

“And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu it is time to get this deal done,” she said.

#### Pressure on Harris over Gaza

Harris, now vying for president after President Joe Biden [exited the race](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8)
 Sunday, will inevitably face demands and questions from voters, including reliably Democratic young and progressive blocs, who want to see an immediate and permanent cease-fire, and the release of all hostages.

Cease-fire negotiations have been stop-and-start for months, including on a [Biden-backed proposal](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-urges-hamas-accept-new-israeli-ceasefire-plan-intended-end-war)
 announced in May.

The death toll in the Gaza Strip has surpassed 39,000 since Israel’s offensive began nearly 10 months ago, according to Gaza health officials in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory.

Netanyahu told lawmakers during a joint meeting of Congress in the U.S. stop providing aid and weapons to Israel.

Following Netanyahu’s near hour-long [address to lawmakers](https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-us-backing-defeat-hamas)
, demonstrators amassed outside the city’s Union Station, where they burned American flags and graffitied the words “Hamas is coming” among other messages on a statue and fountain dedicated to Christopher Columbus, according to [numerous](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-near-us-capitol-ahead-netanyahu-speech-2024-07-24/)

 [reports](https://time.com/7003081/photos-netanyahu-washington-dc-protests-demonstrations-police-clashes-arrests-capitol/)
.

Harris issued a statement Thursday morning condemning the “despicable” events outside Union Station, just under a half-mile from the Capitol.

“I condemn any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas, which has vowed to annihilate the State of Israel and kill Jews. over the Gaza war, Harris asked Americans to “encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the nuance, and the history of the region.”

Netanyahu’s trip to Washington attracted thousands of protesters to areas surrounding Capitol Hill who demanded the U.S. <image:9563>\

Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee after Biden dropped out of [the election race](https://www.reuters.com/topic/event/us-elections/)
 on Sunday, did not mince words about the humanitarian crisis gripping Gaza after nine months of [war between Israel and Hamas militants](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
.

"We cannot allow ourselves to be numb to the suffering and I will not be silent," she said.

Harris' remarks were sharp and serious in tone and raised the question of whether she would be more aggressive in dealing with Netanyahu if elected president on Nov. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel's retaliatory attack in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people and caused a humanitarian calamity with most of the coastal enclave leveled, people displaced from their homes, famine and a shortage of emergency relief.

Biden met with Netanyahu earlier and told him that he needed to close gaps to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and remove obstacles in the flow of aid, according to a readout of the meeting provided by the White House.

Netanyahu will meet Harris' Republican rival, Donald Trump, on Friday at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

"There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, and as I just told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done," Harris said.

Although as vice president she has mostly echoed Biden in firmly backing Israel's right to defend itself, she made clear on Thursday that she was losing patience with Israel's military approach.

"Israel has a right to defend itself. "Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war."

Democratic presidential contender strikes tough tone in public remarks following meeting with Israeli prime minister on US visit

Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has pressed Israel’s [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 on the “dire” humanitarian situation in Gaza in talks that she described as frank, adding “I will not be silent.”

In comments that were closely watched for signs of a shift from Joe Biden’s policy approach, the US vice-president said after the meeting: “What has happened in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 over the past nine months is devastating. “As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” she said.

Hours earlier, Israel’s prime minister had enjoyed a more cordial [greeting from Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/25/netanyahu-and-biden-will-meet-to-discuss-a-ceasefire-in-gaza)
 in the Oval Office, saying: “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish-American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel.”

According to a White House [account](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/25/readout-of-president-joe-bidens-meeting-with-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel/)
 of their meeting, the two leaders discussed the ceasefire and hostage negotiations “in detail”, and Biden “expressed the need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza”.

Harris’ forceful remarks on Thursday, which were sharp and serious in tone, reflected what might mark a departure from Biden in how she deals with Netanyahu. Some noted the significance of Harris being the one to give public remarks after both she and Biden had separately met the prime minister.

During the meeting, Harris brought up the repeated displacement of Palestinians since the start of the war, sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and 250 hostages were taken.

!Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with US vice-president Kamala Harris in Washington, DC on Thursday. She said Israel has “a right to defend itself and how it does so matters.”

Harris’s backers say that she is [more likely to engage in public criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/23/as-netanyahu-arrives-in-washington-kamala-harris-treads-a-careful-path-on-israel-and-gaza)
 of Netanyahu than Biden and to focus attention on the civilian toll among Palestinians from the war in Gaza – even if she would maintain US military aid and other support for Israel that has been a mainstay of Biden’s foreign policy.

White House officials say Israel and Hamas are “closer now than we’ve been before” to reaching a ceasefire deal, with a senior administration official saying a framework for the deal had been agreed upon but that “serious implementation issues … still had to be resolved. The two men have had a strained relationship since Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his victory in the 2020 election, which Trump has claimed without evidence was manipulated.

Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with US vice-president Kamala Harris in Washington, DC on Thursday. “It’s a kind of like: ‘How do we close these final gaps?’”

Netanyahu promised “total victory” in the Gaza war in a raucous speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying that there were “intensive” efforts to bring the hostages home but giving little detail about how that would be achieved.

Harris – the presiding officer of the Senate – did not attend Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday but released a careful statement saying that her absence should not be interpreted as a boycott of the event.

Netanyahu said on Thursday he met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in Washington on Wednesday after his address to Congress. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering and I will not be silent.”

She called for the establishment of a Palestinian state and for Netanyahu and [Hamas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas)
 to agree a ceasefire and hostage release deal to end a war she said had led to the deaths of far too many innocent civilians. Photograph: Kenny Holston/EPA

Israel’s retaliatory offensive against Hamas has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry.

Harris also recalled planting trees for Israel as a child and said that as a senator from California and as vice-president she has had an “unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel” and its people."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence confirms a meeting between Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu, but it occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024. During this meeting, Harris discussed Israel's right to defend itself and expressed an "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)).

The evidence does not provide the exact quote from the claim. However, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the idea that she would express continued support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely true in spirit, but the exact wording and date are not directly confirmed.

The New Jersey Monitor ([https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/25/vp-harris-meets-with-netanyahu-to-discuss-israel-hamas-war-in-gaza/](https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/07/25/vp-harris-meets-with-netanyahu-to-discuss-israel-hamas-war-in-gaza/)) reported on a meeting between Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, where Harris discussed Israel's right to defend itself, concerns about the suffering in Gaza, and support for a two-state solution <image:9559>. Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-harris-meet-netanyahu-separately-gaza-ceasefire-2024-07-25/)) also reported on the July 25, 2024 meeting, noting Harris urged a Gaza ceasefire and stated, "It is time for this war to end" <image:9567>. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)) covered the meeting on July 26, 2024, highlighting Harris's statement, "I will not be silent" on the suffering in Gaza, and her "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" <image:9568>, <image:9569>.


## Elaboration
The new evidence confirms a meeting between Kamala Harris and Benjamin Netanyahu, but it occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024. During this meeting, Harris discussed Israel's right to defend itself and expressed an "unwavering commitment to the existence of the state of Israel" ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/kamala-harris-benjamin-netanyahu-us-visit-palestine-israel-gaza-war)).

The evidence does not provide the exact quote from the claim. However, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the idea that she would express continued support for Israel.

Therefore, the claim is likely true in spirit, but the exact wording and date are not directly confirmed.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and discussed Israel's right to defend itself, expressing unwavering commitment to Israel's existence. While the exact quote from the claim ("Our support for Israel will continue") is not directly found, the context of the meeting and Harris's statements support the claim's sentiment. However, the date is off.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed support for Israel, the meeting occurred on July 25, 2024, not July 22, 2024, as stated in the claim. Although the sentiment of the claim aligns with Harris's statements, the specific date is inaccurate.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is relevant to Israeli law, particularly concerning Jewish identity and immigration.
2.  A bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel existed.
3.  The evidence does not explicitly state that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.

**Insufficient Information**: The claim's veracity cannot be determined with the provided evidence. More information is needed to ascertain whether DNA testing is illegal in Israel.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

===========================================================

*   [Home](/en/)
    
*   [Blog](/en/blog-en/)
    
*   Repatriation to Israel via a DNA Test (Proof of Jewishness)

According to the Israeli Law of Return, the Jewish people, Jewish children, Jewish grandchildren, Jewish spouses, and Jewish widowers/widows have the right to repatriate (immigrate) to Israel and automatically receive Israeli citizenship as a result. Its jurisdiction comes into force at the moment when one of the plaintiffs is not an Israeli citizen.

In general terms, the procedure of proving Jewishness based on a DNA test is as follows: an Israeli citizen issues a special power of attorney to his lawyer. The results of the DNA tests of other laboratories, especially those carried out before the relevant court decision and outside the procedure adopted and described below by Israeli law, are not recognized. If you are planning such a case, we recommend you to contact a lawyer, state the essence and, through a lawyer, consult with laboratories regarding the possibility of carrying out such DNA test and its legitimacy to obtain the right to repatriation.

  They may require clarification and more substantial evidence of Jewishness or relationship and usually do not allow resubmission of the documents.

If your documents did not convince the officials of your Jewish roots and you were denied to immigrate to Israel, do not despair as you have a way out to prove you are a Jew via a DNA test. This is not a popular myth about the “Jewish gene.” The possibility of repatriation to Israel based on the DNA test suggests that the applicant for Aliyah has Jewish relatives who are already citizens of Israel.

### Major factors in favor of repatriation to Israel on the basis of a DNA test:

1. But, if the applicant for repatriation has relatives who are already citizens of Israel, then the DNA test can serve as a basis for repatriation.
2. The procedure of proving you are a Jew or have Jewish origins based on the DNA test takes about 3 months from signing a contract with a lawyer to obtaining a court verdict and gaining approval for immigration. Even if the request for repatriation was already denied by the Israeli consulate, a positive DNA test allows you to apply to the consulate again. Exceptions can be either the identification of undeniable documentary evidence of Jewishness that was not sufficient before or the proof of Jewish roots by a DNA test.

### To illustrate how it happens, we will tell a case from our practice:

The father became a citizen of Israel in 1991, but his son remained in one of the former republics of the USSR."

The PZ-Law.co.il article indicates that DNA tests can be used to prove Jewishness for immigration if the applicant has relatives who are already Israeli citizens. This contradicts the claim that it is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel. `false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. Evidence from PZ-Law.co.il ([Source](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)) indicates that DNA tests are used in Israel for immigration purposes, specifically to prove Jewishness, suggesting that DNA testing is not universally illegal.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The protest, which took place on April 12, 2025, was a "March for Gaza" organized by the Palestine Solidarity Movement. The event was mistakenly attributed to Kolkata by some media outlets.


## Final Judgement
The claim is false because the image is from a protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The protest was in support of Palestine, but the location is misrepresented. `false`

Content: "According to UN figures, some 1.7 million people have been displaced, with many forced to move repeatedly in search of safety.

But the UN's children's agency, Unicef, says its biggest concern is for an estimated 19,000 children who are orphaned or have ended up alone with no adult to look after them.

"Many of these children have been found under the rubble or have lost their parents in the bombing of their home," Jonathan Crickx, chief of communications for Unicef Palestine, tells me from Rafah in southern Gaza.

Injured, hungry and alone - the Gazan children orphaned by war
==============================================================

! Hanna did not live to name her daughter.

"We just call her the daughter of Hanna Abu Amsha," says nurse Warda al-Awawda, who is caring for the tiny newborn at the al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions which some may find upsetting.**_

In the chaos caused by the ongoing fighting and with entire families almost wiped out, medics and rescuers often struggle to find carers for bereaved children.

"We have lost contact with her family," the nurse tells us. "None of her relatives have shown up and we don't know what happened to her father."

Children, who make up nearly half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, have had their lives shattered by the brutal war.

Although Israel says it strives to avoid civilian casualties, including issuing evacuation orders, more than 11,500 under-18s have been killed according to Palestinian health officials. <image:9632>!Abed Hussein who has been orphaned by the war <image:9641>

Abed Hussein, whose parents were both killed, says he can't sleep at night without them

Even when relatives can be found, they are not always well placed to help care for bereaved children.

"Let's keep in mind they are often also in a very dire situation," Mr Crickx says.

"They may have their own children to take care of and it can be difficult, if not impossible, for them to take care of these unaccompanied and separated children."

Since the war started, a non-profit organisation, SOS Children's Villages, which works locally with Unicef, says it has been working to take in 55 such children, all aged under 10. She was brought in with selective mutism, an anxiety disorder which left her unable to speak about what had happened to her and her family, but is now making progress after being welcomed with gifts and playing with other children she lives with.

Unicef believes that nearly all children in Gaza are now in need of mental health support.

With their lives shattered, even when there is a lasting ceasefire, many will be left with terrible losses that they will struggle to overcome.

The mother of this newborn baby did not live long enough to name her

**Born amid the horrors of the war in Gaza, the month-old baby girl lying in an incubator has never known a parent's embrace.**

She was delivered by Caesarean section after her mother, Hanna, was crushed in an Israeli air strike. Even more have injuries, many of them life-changing.

It is hard to get accurate figures but according to a recent report from Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a non-profit group, more than 24,000 children have also lost one or both parents.

Ibrahim Abu Mouss, just 10 years old, suffered severe leg and stomach injuries when a missile hit his home. But his tears are for his dead mum, grandfather and sister.

"They kept telling me they were being treated upstairs in the hospital," says Ibrahim as his father clutches his hand.

"But I found out the truth when I saw photos on my dad's phone."

21 July 2025 [Human Rights](/en/news/topic/human-rights)

Badriya collapses from hunger, Khadija dreams of her kitchen and Hiyam longs for her daughters’ laughter in the garden – these are the stories of three women from Gaza who embody the daily struggles of mothers exhausted by war, hunger and displacement as the nearly two-year-long conflict continues.

In Gaza City, families living in tents reveal a shared, grim reality.

Many have been forced to flee the fighting dozens of times. “What is my fault and my children’s fault when we are displaced from one place to another and they die of hunger?”

Hiyam's daughters eating a lunch of lentil soup, without bread, where they live, inside a destroyed building.

**Mass displacement**
---------------------

According to UN reports, more than two million Palestinians –the population of Gaza – live in about 15 per cent of the Strip’s area after the war caused widespread destruction of infrastructure and homes.

International organizations have warned that the continuation of the conflict threatens to have “catastrophic consequences” in the near term.

That includes a serious impact on children’s mental and physical health, the spread of disease and the disintegration of social structures.

This amid the absence of any clear path towards a political or humanitarian solution.

Khadija Manoun said she and her family have moved more than 20 times, from Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip to a destroyed building in western Gaza, in search of shelter. Clean drinking water is a luxury that Khadija chases after, running between trucks, often returning with empty containers.

Amid all this, she sometimes reminisces, scrolling through photos on her mobile phone of her old home and the meals they used to eat.

In her modest tent on the beach west of Gaza City, Badriya Barawi, from Beit Lahia, sits, arranging what remains of her life. Her spacious, fully equipped kitchen is now just a corner in the rubble, where a solitary soap dish borrowed from a neighbour sits. Her dressing room is now home to tattered suitcases.

“This is now my closet where I put everything,” she said. How long will this life go on?”

She says her children are crying from the heat and hunger.

“We haven’t had bread for three days. This morning, I fed the children hummus, but is that enough for their stomachs?" said Ms. Barawi, who suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes.

She said she collapses daily from a lack of food.

Month-old girl pulled from rubble in Gaza after airstrike killed her parents
============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Mar 20, 2025 3:02 PM EDT

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — As rescuers dug through the remains of a collapsed apartment building in Gaza’s Khan Younis on Thursday, they could hear the cries of a baby from underneath the rubble.

Suddenly, calls of “God is great” rang out. We never felt that there was stability, not at all.”

**READ MORE:** [Israeli strikes across Gaza hit multiple homes, killing at least 85 Palestinians](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-hit-multiple-homes-killing-at-least-85-palestinians)

Israel resumed heavy strikes across Gaza on Tuesday, shattering the truce that had facilitated the release of more than two dozen hostages. The military did not immediately comment on the overnight strikes.

Hours later, the Israeli military restored a blockade on northern Gaza, including Gaza City, that it had maintained for most of the war, but which had been lifted under the ceasefire deal.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had returned to what remains of their homes in the north after a ceasefire took hold in January.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.

Israel’s blistering retaliatory air and ground offensive has killed nearly 49,000 Palestinians since then, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The baby girl stirred fitfully as paramedics checked her over.

Her parents and brother were dead in the overnight Israeli airstrike.

“When we asked people, they said she is a month old and she has been under the rubble, since dawn,” said Hazen Attar, a civil defense first responder. She had been born 25 days earlier, in the midst of a tenuous ceasefire that many Palestinians in Gaza had hoped would mark the end of a war that has devastated the enclave, killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly its entire population.

Only the girl’s grandparents survived the attack. Killed were her brother, mother and father, along with another family that included a father and his seven children. Rescuers digging through the rubble could be seen pulling out the small body of a child sprawled on the mattress where he had been sleeping.

The girl’s grandmother, Fatima Abu Dagga, sat with a group of other women in a relative’s house Thursday, taking turns cradling the infant. Her sons and their wives and eight grandchildren died in the bombing, and only the baby survived."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:38>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.

Among the Palestinians killed in the West Bank during April was a man who was shot after a raid on his house in the Old City of Nablus, during which his brother was arrested, according to OCHA.

That same day, 2 April, Israeli troops [shot and killed](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin_omar_zioud)
 Omar Amer Zyoud, a 16-year-old who was reportedly among a group that threw incendiary objects at military jeeps at the entrance to Silat al-Harithiya village near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man after he allegedly threw stones at Israeli vehicles in the Bethlehem area of the southern West Bank on 3 April and confiscated his body.

A man was killed by Israeli troops searching his house when they shot at him while he was attempting to flee in his vehicle in Jenin on 4 April.

Palestinians, mostly children, receive a warm meal distributed by charitable organizations in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, 26 April.

On 6 April, Israeli forces [shot and killed](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/tamara-nassar/israel-kills-children-routinely-west-bank)
 Amer Rabee, a 14-year-old Palestinian American, at the entrance to Turmusayya, a town north of Ramallah in the central West Bank.

The Israeli military [claimed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/palestinian-teenager-with-us-citizenship-shot-dead-by-israeli-settler-2025-04-06/)
 it had opened fire toward “terrorists” who had “hurled rocks” towards a highway.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_14_year_old_palestinian_american_boy_near_ramallah)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Amer and two other children “were picking green almonds on the agricultural land adjacent to Route 60, when Israeli soldiers started shooting at the children from a distance of about 20 meters (66 feet) away.”

“Amer was shot in the head and immediately collapsed,” the rights group added.

DCIP said that Israeli forces withheld the boy’s body, which was found to have sustained 13 bullet wounds, for around five hours. <image:8806>

On 11 April, the UN human rights office [warned](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-briefing-notes/2025/04/gaza-increasing-israeli-evacuation-orders-lead-forcible-transfer)
 that “Israel appears to be inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible with their continued existence as a group.”

The UN office said that “the nature and scope” of evacuation orders displacing Palestinians in Gaza “raise serious concerns that Israel intends permanently to remove the civilian population from these areas in order to create a ‘buffer zone.’”

“Permanently displacing the civilian population within occupied territory amounts to forcible transfer, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute,” the UN human rights office added.

Also during the month of April, the World Food Program reported that around 700,000 Palestinians in the West Bank “needed food assistance in 2024, a nearly 100 percent increase compared with the period before October 2023,” the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [stated](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
.

On 19 April, the Israeli military announced that one of its officers was [killed](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-04-19/ty-article/israeli-officer-killed-in-gaza-combat-idf-says/00000196-4f4a-d9fb-a79f-6fca06ce0000)
 by an explosive device in northern Gaza – the army’s first fatality since it resumed its offensive on Gaza a month earlier.

Also on 23 April, 10 people were [killed](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-airstrikes-kill-10-school-housing-displaced-families-hit-childrens-2025-04-23/)
 in an Israeli airstrike on a school where displaced families were sheltering in Gaza City.

At least 26 people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza over the previous 24 hours, the health ministry said on 23 April. The boy died after nearly 20 hours in intensive care, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine, which [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_palestinian_child_with_expanding_bullet_in_jalazone_refugee_camp_raid)
 that the boy’s severe internal injuries were likely caused by expanding bullets.

These weapons have been prohibited under international law since 1868, according to Ayed Abu Eqtaish, a program director with the rights group, “due to the extreme and unnecessary suffering they cause.”

“Yet, Israeli forces use these illegal weapons against Palestinian children with no consequences from the international community,” Eqtaish added.

At least five children have been killed by expanding bullets in the West Bank since 7 October 2023, according to DCIP.

. Israel is withholding their bodies.

[According to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-283-west-bank)
 OCHA, the deadly incident “followed the announcement of the death of a Palestinian from the village in Israeli custody … three days before he was set to be released.”

Defense for Children International-Palestine [stated](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_fatally_shoot_confiscate_body_of_16_year_old_palestinian_boy)
 that Jihad Adeli was part of a group that was ambushed by troops.

On 20 April, Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian near Homesh settlement in the northern West Bank after the man reportedly opened fire towards a checkpoint near the settlement, causing no casualties.

On 23 April, Israeli forces shot and killed Mahmoud al-Haija, 12, in a cemetery in al-Yamoun, a town near Jenin in the northern West Bank.

“Mahmoud, alongside other boys and young men, were allegedly throwing stones toward Israeli soldiers deployed around the cemetery while other soldiers raided a residential building nearby,” Defense for Children International-Palestine [said](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_shoot_dead_12_year_old_palestinian_boy_near_jenin)
 in an initial report.

On 25 April, Israeli soldiers hiding behind a tree shot and killed Abdulkhaleq Jabour, 16, while he was closing up the shop where he worked during a military incursion into Salem, a town east of Nablus.

[According to](https://www.dci-palestine.org/israeli_forces_kill_16_year_old_palestinian_boy_working_at_a_shop_near_nablus)
 Defense for Children International-Palestine, Israeli soldiers surrounded Abdulkhaleq for at least 10 minutes while two of his relatives attempted to render first aid.

Israeli forces have killed 24 Palestinian boys and girls in the West Bank since the beginning of the year, according to the children’s rights group.

In addition to the above, on 21 April, a 48-year-old man died of a heart attack triggered by tear gas inhalation after he was assaulted by Israeli forces who accompanied settlers during a raid in the town of Sinjil near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

“During the incident, Israeli forces injured 17 other Palestinians, including four children, and Israeli settlers physically assaulted and injured three Palestinians,” according to OCHA.

Save the Children, a charity based in the UK, [said](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/about-130-children-born-daily-gaza-amid-total-siege-aid-and-goods)
 on 2 April that around 130 babies are being born daily in Gaza, where the health care system is on “the verge of collapse.”

“The survival of mothers and newborn children in Gaza is under particular threat due to the lack of food, destruction of hospitals and chronic stress,” the charity stated.

At least 287 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between 3 and 8 April alone, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-278-gaza-strip)
 the health ministry in the territory.

On 1 April, dozens of settlers broke into Duma village near Nablus in the northern West Bank and set fire to several vehicles, burned a chicken coop and sprayed graffiti on the walls of homes while raiding Israeli forces fired tear gas and live ammunition, injuring three people, [according to](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-279-west-bank)
 the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Palestinians in the West Bank are under increasing pressure from both settlers and the Israeli military.

On 6 April, Israeli forces demolished more than 33 structures, including 11 residential tents, and damaged water tanks and solar panels in Khirbet al-Ras al-Ahmar, located in an area of the West Bank’s Jordan Valley that Israel has designated as a firing zone.

The mass demolition incident displaced 33 people, including 19 children – all of whom were previously displaced from another area of the Jordan Valley due to settler violence, according to OCHA. <image:8781>

 that it was “alarmed by the breakdown of public order in Gaza, with recent allegations of killings and unnecessary or disproportionate use of force in crowd control by local police.”

The UN office added that Gaza’s governance and law enforcement structures have been dismantled and destroyed by Israel’s attacks, “contributing to a deterioration of public order that threatens the safety of Palestinians and their access to basic services and life-saving humanitarian aid.”

Also on 6 April, Hamas said it [fired rockets](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-fires-rockets-israeli-cities-2025-04-06/)
 from Gaza, with Israeli media reporting a direct strike in Ashkelon in southern Israel that lightly injured 12 people."

© AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE | 2024 | Všetky práva vyhradené. An image that social media posts say shows a Palestinian child trapped under rubble, however, actually appeared online at least eight months before the Gaza war, triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas militants against Israel on October 7. May God have mercy on them,” commented another.

However, AFP found the image circulated online months before Hamas’ October 7 attack and Israel’s subsequent bombardment of Gaza.

**Image predates war**

A reverse search on [TinEye](https://perma.cc/LLV5-F8GJ)
 found the image has been shared online as early as February 2023, eight months before the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The photo was shared by user on [X](https://perma.cc/7YHX-8864)
, formerly Twitter, on February 8 in response to a post about relief works in Syria and Turkey following a devastating [earthquake](https://perma.cc/MU4G-PSSL)
 on February 6 that killed more than 50,000 people.

A Google reverse image search found the same image had also been shared on [LinkedIn](https://perma.cc/L9XV-TPYA)
 in February 2023.

Below is a screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right):

**Author(s):** AFP Bangladesh

**Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip has killed thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government. Long live, Long live Palestine”, reads the Bengali-language caption.

The post circulated after Hamas militants poured into Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians and taking 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gaza’s Hamas government.

A [truce agreement](https://perma.cc/M3X2-VPC8)
 that went into effect on November 24 has brought a temporary halt to seven weeks of fighting and saw dozens of Israeli hostages freed, with over 100 Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in return.

! The image also bears visual irregularities that suggest it had been AI-generated, an expert told AFP.**

The image appearing to show a child trapped under concrete blocks was posted [here](https://perma.cc/6QFW-LYRP)
 on Facebook on October 19, 2023, and has since been shared more than 4,000 times.

Screenshot comparison of the image shared in the false posts (left) and the image that circulated online in February 2023 (right)

A visual communications expert told AFP it was “highly likely” the picture was generated with AI tools.

[Dr TJ Thomson](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/t/thomson-dr-t-j)
, a senior lecturer at Australia’s RMIT University School of Media and Communications, told AFP there were anomalies in the creases in the child’s forehead and chin, as well as the fingers on the child’s left hand.

An analysis of the image showed the child appears to have too many fingers, which are also deformed.

Despite the advancements in generative AI, errors still show up in AI-generated content."

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble in Gaza due to Israeli airstrikes. The BBC News article from January 31, 2024, mentions that many children have been found under the rubble. The PBS News article from March 20, 2025, reports on an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, that killed at least 16 people, mostly women and children. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image or the exact date (April 2025) mentioned in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it is plausible that children were found dead under the rubble of their home in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. However, the claim's specific details, such as the exact date and the image's origin, cannot be verified with the provided evidence.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.4, 'Pakistan': 0.31, 'Tunisia': 0.13, 'Jordan': 0.02, 'Bhutan': 0.01, 'China': 0.01, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine. This supports the claim that the image is related to Gaza, as Gaza is part of Palestine. However, the evidence still does not confirm the exact date or the circumstances described in the claim.

The evidence confirms that the image is likely related to the conflict in Gaza, as the geolocation analysis suggests it was taken in Palestine. The search results also show that images of children in the context of the Gaza conflict are circulating. However, the search did not return the specific image in the claim, and the claim's details, such as the exact date and circumstances, remain unverified. The evidence also includes a debunking of a different image, which highlights the need for caution.

Therefore, the claim is still unverified due to the lack of direct evidence supporting the specific image and its context.

However, the specific image and its context cannot be verified with the provided evidence. The search results did not return the image, and the claim's details remain unconfirmed. Therefore, the claim is considered `false`.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is **false**. While the evidence confirms that children have been found under rubble in Gaza, and the image's geolocation points to Palestine, the specific image and its context cannot be verified. The search results did not return the image, and the claim's details remain unconfirmed.

**ISTANBUL**

Iranian Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force, was seen alive and well during celebrations Tuesday in Tehran of Iran's self-claimed victory over Israel, according to local media.

A video posted by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency showed Qaani among the crowd at the event.

“Commander Qaani attends today’s gathering of the people of Tehran following Operation Divine Victory,” the agency said on X.

State-funded Press TV also published the video, saying: “Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, was warmly received by a jubilant crowd in Tehran during victory celebrations over the Zionist (Israeli) regime.”

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Qaani was among the Iranian military leaders killed in Israeli strikes.

Israel launched airstrikes on several sites across Iran since June 13, including military and nuclear facilities, alleging that Tehran was on the verge of producing a nuclear bomb, a claim vehemently denied by Iran.

While Iran launched retaliatory missile and drone strikes, the US joined the conflict by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday.

After 12 days of aerial combat between the two regional arch-foes, US President Donald Trump announced overnight a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end their conflict. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence contradicts the claim. Reports indicate that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, which is after the alleged April 2025 date of him fleeing to Israel. There is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel.

For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Iran's IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani has fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel."

## Actions
```
web_search("Esmail Qaani fled Iran Israel April 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force, is the subject of reports. One source mentions reports of Qaani being killed in Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, but these were not confirmed, and a video from June 24, 2025, showed him in Tehran (<image:k>). Another source reports Qaani appeared in Tehran during celebrations, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination (<image:0>). A third source reports on a post denying rumors of ties to Esmail Qaani (<image:1>).

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani), [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-s-quds-force-commander-appears-after-reports-of-his-assassination/3612018), and [https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-859504).


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. Reports indicate that Esmail Qaani was seen in Tehran in June 2025, which is after the alleged April 2025 date of him fleeing to Israel. There is no evidence to support the claim that he fled to Israel.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results show conflicting information about Esmail Qaani's whereabouts. While there were reports of his death and appearances in Tehran, there is no evidence to support the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is safe in Israel.

`false`

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza
============================================================

### The video actually shows him at a U.S. The video had been shared close to 4,000 times and viewed more than 700,000 at the time of publishing.

The video, and screenshots from the video, were shared with similar captions across multiple platforms in March 2025.

“I’ve got zero sympathy or respect for this Zionist puppet!!” one Facebook user [wrote](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10236160829271032&set=a.1416068811808)
 while another on Bluesky [wrote](https://bsky.app/profile/paulwalker44.bsky.social/post/3ljilv7ute227)
“Libs love Zelensky. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/europe/ukraine-russia-kherson-front-lines/index.html)
 and Russia exchanged aerial assaults overnight, just hours after the Kremlin agreed to temporarily halt attacks on energy infrastructure targets, but stopped short of signing off on a broader ceasefire sought by the US.

President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump [spoke by phone](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/politics/trump-putin-ceasefire-russia-ukraine-war/index.html)
 on Tuesday, with the Russian leader not agreeing to the 30-day truce that Trump has endorsed and Ukraine has agreed to. The White House said a narrower pause on attacking energy targets would go into effect followed by negotiations over a broader ceasefire.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday accused Putin of already breaking his pledge, saying that Russia attacked Ukraine with 150 drones overnight, including strikes on energy facilities.

The Kremlin also condemned an overnight attack on an oil facility in Russia, saying it showed Ukraine’s “lack of will” to reach a deal – although Kyiv was not part of the negotiation talks, and no formal agreement has been signed.

Zelensky said Tuesday that while Kyiv supported the pause in attacks on energy targets, he wanted to know the details behind the proposal that Trump and Putin discussed in their bilateral meeting.

Authorities in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar said a Ukrainian drone had caused a fire at an oil depot near the village of Kavkazskaya, Reuters reported. According to our data, the enemy’s grouping in the Kursk direction currently consists of 70,000 soldiers.”

Content: "The "first steps toward real peace must include forcing the sole source of this war, Russia, to stop such attacks against life,” the Ukrainian leader said.

Russia targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight in a large-scale missile and drone attack, Ukrainian officials said Friday.

At least 10 people, including a child, were wounded, authorities said.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko described the attack as "massive" in a post on Facebook.

“Russia is trying to hurt ordinary Ukrainians by striking energy and gas production facilities, without abandoning its goal of leaving us without light and heat, and causing the greatest harm to ordinary citizens,” Halushchenko said.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that energy supplies were a legitimate target in the war, as they were linked to Ukraine's "military industrial complex and weapons production."

The attack came hours after Zelenskyy announced that talks with the US on ending the three-year war would take place in Saudi Arabia next week.

The overnight bombardment comes days after Washington announced it would stop sharing military support and intelligence with Ukraine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce on Friday after Russia bombarded Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight.

Writing on Telegram, he reiterated that there must be "silence" in the seas and skies over Ukraine. Zelenskyy has also proposed ceasing combat operations in the Black Sea to allow safe shipping.

Zelenskyy's proposals contain elements of those suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron during last week's summit of leaders in London.

In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Macron proposed a four-week truce in the "air, sea and on energy infrastructure" that would not cover fighting along the frontline in the east, as this would be complex to "monitor".

France's Foreign Minister Joel-Noel Barrot reiterated that a temporary pause would allow European allies to determine whether Russia was acting in "good faith" when committing to a true.

"That's when real peace negotiations can start," Barrot said.

Russia has not publicly commented on the French proposals for peace.

Also on Tuesday, the Ukrainian leader announced he was ready to work under US President Donald Trump's "strong leadership" to get lasting peace, signalling a turnaround from when he left the White House following a spat between the two last week.

The US temporarily paused both military aid and [intelligence](https://www.euronews.com/2025/03/05/us-puts-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine-on-pause-cia-director-says)
 to Ukraine this week following the public argument, although officials suggested that the latter pause would be lifted if Ukraine quickly came back to the negotiating table.

Zelenskyy has faced intense US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, whilst he has been pushing for security guarantees for Kyiv.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells. According to a Spotlight by EBU article published on March 13, 2025, the video and images were falsely shared online with captions claiming Zelenskyy signed bombs to be dropped on Gazans. The video was actually taken at a U.S. munitions factory on September 23, 2024, and the handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. The Euronews article from March 7, 2025, reports that Zelenskyy called for an air and sea truce after a Russian missile attack. The CNN article from March 19, 2025, discusses the exchange of attacks between Ukraine and Russia. <image:40>

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

Turkey, which had a large Jewish community, recognised the state of Israel as early as 1949, ahead of all other Muslim-majority countries. And Turkey’s generals admired the Israeli army: Jenkins highlights the enthusiasm of Turkish National Security Council secretary-general Doğan Bayazıt, who envied ‘the closeness of the Israeli army to the people’ and its ‘leading role in society’."

# Your Judgement

Content: "We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

A Haaretz article ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)) discusses President Trump's involvement in the relationship between Syria and Israel.


## Elaboration
The new evidence indicates that Erdogan made statements regarding Israel's actions in Syria in January and February 2025. On March 30, 2025, Erdogan prayed for Israel's destruction. The evidence does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there were discussions and actions involving Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in early 2025, including statements by Erdogan, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim. While there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in early 2025, including statements by Erdogan, there is no record of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results show Erdogan made statements regarding Israel's actions in Syria in January and February 2025, and on March 30, 2025, he prayed for Israel's destruction, but not that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.

Published On 16 Jul 202516 Jul 2025

Israel has carried out powerful [air strikes](/news/2025/7/16/why-did-israel-bomb-syria-a-look-at-the-druze-and-the-violence-in-suwayda)
 near Syria’s presidential palace and on the military headquarters in the heart of Damascus, a major escalation in its bombardment of the neighbouring country.

At least three people were killed and 34 others were wounded in the [attacks on Damascus](/video/newsfeed/2025/7/16/israel-targets-syrian-government-with-attack-on-damascus-military-hq)
 on Wednesday, Syrian state media reported, citing the Ministry of Health.

While targeting Damascus, the Israeli military continued to pound areas in southern Syria, including [Suwayda](/news/2025/7/16/sectarian-tension-israeli-intervention-what-led-violence-syria)
, where a new ceasefire deal has been struck after four days of clashes between Druze armed groups, Bedouin tribes and government forces, which left hundreds dead.

Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Israeli attacks on Damascus and Suwayda were “part of a systematic Israeli policy to ignite tension and chaos and undermine security in Syria”, calling on the international community to take “urgent action” against Israeli aggression.

Israel said its bombing campaign is aimed at protecting the Druze minority, and it has called on the Syrian government to withdraw its troops from the city of Suwayda, where much of the violence has taken place.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said on X that the Israeli military would “continue to operate vigorously in Suwayda to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely”.

Later on Wednesday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the parties to the fighting in southern Syria had agreed on “specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight”.

“This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X of the ceasefire deal, reached one day after an earlier iteration had collapsed.

More than 300 people had been killed in fighting as of Wednesday morning, including four children, eight women and 165 soldiers and security forces, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Army withdrawal from Suwayda
----------------------------

The Syrian Ministry of Interior and Druze leader Sheikh Yousef Jarbou confirmed on Wednesday that they had reached a ceasefire. But the new deal was rejected by Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajari, another Druze leader, who promised to continue fighting until Suwayda was “entirely liberated”.

According to the ministry, the deal declares a “total and immediate halt to all military operations”, as well as the formation of a committee comprising government officials and Druze spiritual leaders to supervise its implementation.

That evening, the Syrian Ministry of Defence said it had begun withdrawing the army from Suwayda “in implementation of the terms of the adopted agreement after the end of the sweep of the city for outlaw groups”.

Speaking shortly before Rubio’s announcement of a deal, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce had said that the US wanted Syrian government forces to “withdraw their military in order to enable all sides to de-escalate and find a path forward”.

But while Syrian troops are withdrawing, the government will be maintaining a presence in the city,

Reporting from Syria’s capital Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the deal included the “deployment of government forces”.

“They will set up checkpoints, and this area will be fully integrated into the Syrian state,” she said.

A complete withdrawal by the government would, she said, “mean a failure in efforts by the new authorities to unite a fractured nation and extend its authority across Syria”.

“But staying could open a much bigger conflict with Israel that has promised more strikes if, in the words of Katz, the message wasn’t received.”

Pretext to bomb
---------------

The escalation in Syria began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between Druze armed factions and local Sunni Bedouin tribes in the southern province of Suwayda.

Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze, with reports of the former carrying out human rights abuses, according to local monitors and analysts.

The actions committed by members of the security forces – acknowledged as “unlawful criminal acts” by the Syrian presidency – have given Israel a pretext to bombard Syria as it builds [military bases](/news/2025/2/3/satellite-images-show-israel-building-military-bases-in-syria-buffer-zone)
 in the demilitarised buffer zone with Syria seized by its forces.

Haid Haid, consulting fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that Israel had been clear since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad last year that they did not want Syrian forces “to be deployed to the deconfliction line in southern Syria”.

“One way Israel is trying to advance that plan is to present itself as the ‘protectors’ of the Druze community,” Haid said.

Ammar Kahf, the Damascus-based executive director of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies, said: “It’s a clear message to the Syrian government that the Israelis are not going to be silent.

“The Israelis are not going to allow the Syrian government to spread its authority all over the territory.”

CNN  — 

Syria says it is withdrawing troops from a flashpoint southern city after days of deadly clashes with an [Arab minority group](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-sectarian-clashes-druze-intl)
 that triggered military action from Israel.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the country was “not afraid of war” but had chosen to put its people “above chaos and destruction,” after his government announced a new ceasefire with the Druze, an offshoot of Islam whose followers are spread across Syria, Israel and Lebanon.

The truce followed intervention from the US as well as Israeli strikes on the Syrian capital Damascus, with Israel saying it was acting to protect the Druze.

So far, the ceasefire appears to be holding, but it is unclear whether it will last. They are made up of a network of groups with multiple figureheads.

In Syria, the Druze community is concentrated around three main provinces close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in the south of the country, and form a majority in the Suwayda province.

More than 20,000 Druze also live in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981.

Hundreds of Druze crossed from Israel into Syria this week, apparently responding to pleas from Druze leaders to support their community in the ongoing clashes.

While Israel says its efforts aim to protect Syria’s Druze the country has also been alarmed by the Syrian government and has been trying to shore up its borders by expanding its military footprint in the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously referred to the new leaders of the country as an “extremist Islamic regime” and a threat to Israel.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed alarm over the continued escalation of violence in Suwayda, also condemning “Israel’s escalatory airstrikes on Suwayda, Daraa and in the center of Damascus,” and calling for “an immediate cessation of all violations of Syria’s sovereignty.”

At least 169 people have been killed, and 200 others injured during several days of clashes in the south, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said on Wednesday. A previous deal collapsed within hours, and a prominent Druze leader has rejected the new truce.

In a televised address to the nation early Thursday, Sharaa said the Syria was faced with two options: either “an open war” with Israel “at the cost of our Druze citizens,” or allowing Druze clerics “to return to reason and prioritize the national interest.”

He vowed to protect the rights of the Druze, many of whom are leery of Syria’s new rulers, who toppled the previous administration in an Islamist-led insurgency.

Syria said on Wednesday night local time its army started withdrawing from Suwayda, where clashes erupted over the weekend between Druze militia and Bedouin tribes, prompting government forces to intervene. Video on Syrian TV purportedly showed a convoy of military vehicles driving out of Suwayda city.

Israel’s airstrikes on Damascus targeted several government buildings Wednesday, with authorities saying at least three people were killed. One video from a Syrian television channel showed the Ministry of Defense building being hit live on air, forcing the anchor to take cover.

In his address, al-Sharaa accused Israel of trying to divide the Syrian people.

“The Israeli entity, known for its repeated attempts to destabilize us and sow division, once again seeks to turn our land into a battlefield of chaos and to dismantle the fabric of our people,” he said.

Israel has stepped up strikes against Syria despite pressure from the US, which has made moves to end the country’s international isolation following the rebel takeover.

US steps in
-----------

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday said the Trump administration had engaged with all parties of the conflict to end the clashes in Syria.

“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight. This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X.

Rubio also described the latest tension between Israel and Syria as a “misunderstanding.”

A statement published by the Syrian government said that, under the new ceasefire, there will be a complete halt to military operations, a monitoring committee will be formed with the Druze leaders and members of the community will be leading security in the province.

A Druze spiritual leader representing one of the factions in Suwayda, Youssef Jarbou, confirmed an agreement was reached for a “complete and immediate halt to all military operations and de-escalation from all sides, with the army returning to its barracks.”

However, Hikmat al-Hijri – another leading Druze figure who had asked for international protection on Wednesday – rejected the ceasefire, calling on his supporters to continue fighting, raising doubts over the truce’s longevity.

The Druze, an Arab sect of roughly one million people, practice an offshoot of Islam which permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage."

US says 'specific steps' agreed to end Syria violence after Israeli strikes hit Damascus

Watch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus

Israel's military struck the Syrian defence ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria for a third day on Wednesday, as deadly sectarian fighting in the mostly Druze province of Suweida continued.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was "working to save our Druze brothers". Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa accused Israel of causing a "large-scale escalation".

More than 350 people are reported to have been killed since Sunday, when clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted in Suweida.

The Syrian military reportedly began to withdraw its forces from Suweida late on Wednesday, as the US said it had agreed "steps" to end the violence.

"We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.

Syria's state news agency, Sana, reported that troops were leaving Suweida as part of an agreement between the government and the Suweida's religious leaders, following the "completion of the army's pursuit of outlaw groups".

The Syrian foreign ministry said the country "welcomes the efforts made by the US and Arabian sides" to "resolve the current crisis" peacefully.

Israel has not yet commented on the ceasefire efforts.

The Israeli military began striking Syrian security forces and their weapons on Monday, after they were deployed to the city of Suweida for the first time since Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.

! Netanyahu urged those with Israeli citizenship to "return to your homes and let the \[Israeli military\] take action".

Israel said the significant escalation of its bombing campaign was aimed at making the Syrian government immediately withdraw its forces from Suweida province.

Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Wednesday afternoon that "the warnings in Damascus" had ended and that the Israeli military would "continue to operate vigorously in Suweida to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely".

He later posted that "the painful blows have begun", above a video clip showing a TV presenter diving under a desk live on camera as an Israeli air strike hit the nearby entrance to the Syrian defence ministry in Umayyad Square, in central Damascus – where huge crowds celebrated Assad's downfall last year.

A separate strike on what the Israeli military called a "military target in the area" of the presidential palace underscored the severity of Israel's warning to Sharaa.

Fadi Al Halabi, a London-based Syrian filmmaker who is visiting Damascus, said he was nearby when he heard the Israeli fighter jets approach.

"People's faces were so afraid. Suddenly the air strike\[s\] began, targeting some of the most crowded areas, including the ministry of defence," he told the BBC.

The Israeli military said it also struck armoured vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.

Syria's foreign ministry said the strikes targeted government institutions and civilian facilities in Damascus and Suweida and killed "several innocent civilians".

"This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law," it added.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that the humanitarian situation in Suweida city had rapidly deteriorated.

It cited sources as saying there were clashes in several area of the city and that tanks had attacked the national hospital, causing panic among the scores of casualties from the fighting being treated there. <image:314>!A BBC map showing Syria, Israel, the occupied Golan Heights and Suweida city <image:315>

Minority groups including the Druze - whose religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs - are suspicious of Sharaa and his government, despite his pledges to protect them.

Their fears have been heightened by several outbreaks of sectarian violence over the past eight months, including one in May in which dozens of people were reportedly killed in clashes between Druze, security forces, and allied Islamist fighters in Damascus and Suweida.

In the wake of that fighting, the government reached an agreement with Druze militias to hire local security forces in Suweida province from their ranks. The continued control of Suweida by the militias sparked tensions with Bedouin tribes backed by the government.

Netanyahu has said he is committed to preventing harm to the Druze in Syria because of their deep ties to those living in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The Syrian interior ministry said a ceasefire had been agreed on Wednesday night to end the fighting in Suweida city

The fighting between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias in Suweida is said to have been sparked by the abduction of a Druze merchant on the highway to Damascus last Friday.

On Sunday, armed Druze fighters reportedly encircled and later seized a neighbourhood of Suweida city that is inhabited by Bedouin. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN and UK, but no longer by the US.

The Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets since the fall of the Assad regime.

And it has sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon.

Later, the Syrian health ministry said government forces had entered the hospital and found "dozens of bodies" after "outlaw groups withdrew", according to the official Sana news agency.

A man named Hosam told the BBC he was in the centre of Suweida city and had witnessed civilians coming under fire from artillery and snipers.

"I lost my neighbour today on the street. We tried to \[get an\] ambulance \[to take\] him to hospital, but we couldn't," he said.

Other witnesses and local activists have described scenes of looting and extrajudicial killings.

The SOHR says more than 350 people have been killed since Sunday in Suweida province.

They include 79 Druze fighters and 55 civilians, 27 of whom were summarily killed by interior ministry and defence ministry forces, according to the group.

At least 189 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, it says.

It was not immediately possible to verify the SOHR's casualty figures, but Syrian security sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the death toll was close to 300.

 [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 in the town of [Caesarea](/wiki/Caesarea_(modern_town) "Caesarea (modern town)")
, Israel. This targeting came in the context of ongoing escalation between [Israel](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack
------

On October 19, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea was targeted by one of three drones, believed to have been launched from Lebanon. She reported that sirens had gone off around Caesarea only after the attack on Netanyahu's residence was confirmed.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:5540>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:5541>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

A “Palestinian terrorist” attempted to drive a car at a police vehicle at the entrance to the Ofra settlement in the Israeli occupied West Bank, the IDF said this morning.

It said the driver of the vehicle was killed and that no Israeli soldiers were injured.

The IDF added that the incident was under review.

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Analysis: Sinwar’s final moments evoke uncomfortable parallels to Israel hero

Shira Pinson

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

Reporting from Aitou, Lebanon

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Police called on the public not to to approach or touch the remains of rockets.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee also ordered residents located in Choueifet Al-Umara and Borj El Brajneh to leave, saying they were "near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah," and urged people to evacuate.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

Israeli police sealed off the site of a reported drone attack in the northern town of Caesarea

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is undeterred from his war aims following a reported drone attack on his private residence.

"The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake," he wrote in a post on X.

His office earlier said a drone was "launched towards" his residence in the northern coastal town of Caesarea on Saturday morning.

Mr Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time, and no one was injured.

Iran says Hezbollah was behind the reported attack, Iranian state news agency IRNA reported.

Iran's mission to the UN was quoted as saying: "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon”.

Hezbollah - which is funded and equipped by Iran - has not commented on the reports.

The Israeli military said three drones were launched from Lebanon, with one hitting a building in Caesarea.

They did not confirm whether the building was part of the prime minister's residence, nor the extent of any damage.

US outlet Axios reported that the drone did hit the residence.

At 08:19 local time (06:19 BST), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: "In the last hour, three unmanned aerial vehicles crossed into the country from Lebanon.

"Two of the aircraft were intercepted.

The Israeli prime minister makes use of two private homes, in Caesarea and Jerusalem, and has also spent time at Beit Aghion, his official residence in Jerusalem, which is currently being renovated.

The reported attack comes as Israel prepares to respond to Iran's large-scale ballistic missile attack on 1 October - with Israel's defence minister saying its response would be "deadly, precise and surprising".

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. No sirens were activated during that attack."

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel&#39;s time was coming to an end and that&#39;s why they&#39;re destroying everything in the way. <image:5565>

Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel's time was coming to an end and that's why they're destroying everything in the way.

However, the truth was that Gibson had no public-facing social media accounts. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

!Mel Gibson apologizes for anti-Semitic slur at Jewish police officer  <image:5574>

The American actor and filmmaker Mel Gibson's has issued a second apology to Jews following a confrontation with policemen during which a drunken Gibson allegedly said: "The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world", asking a police officer: "Are you a Jew?" Gibson said in a statement: "Please know from my heart that I am not an anti-Semite. The project was being created with Mel Gibson's production company, Icon. Gibson clearly is contrite, and he has made a public confession. But the third step can only be evaluated after an extended period of time." The actor is known for holding strongly conservative, Catholic views on religion and politics, and last came under fire from Jewish groups in 2004 for his movie "The Passion of Christ."

Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, confirmed that his client was in an "ongoing program" for his alcoholism. Gibson also said: "I am in the process of understanding where those vicious words came from during that drunken display." The sheriff's deputy who temporarily arrested Gibson last week told AP that he hopes Gibson will hesitate before drinking and driving again. Gibson," said James Mee, who is Jewish.

Image caption,

Gibson said the film was put on hold because Eszterhas' script was 'substandard'

**Hollywood screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has accused Mel Gibson of shelving a movie about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee because he "hates Jews".**

Warner Bros recently halted production on The Maccabees, which Gibson was due to direct, saying Eszterhas' script lacked "a sense of triumph".

In a letter to Gibson, the writer said, "the reason you won't make \[it\] is the ugliest possible one. You hate Jews".

The actor has called the accusations "utter fabrications".

Gibson's reputation has plunged since his arrest for drink-driving in 2006, during which he made anti-Semitic comments to the arresting police officer.

He later apologised for his comments, which he blamed on alcoholism.

Eszterhas nine-page, expletive-filled letter was <link> <caption>published by film industry website The Wrap</caption> <url href="http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/joe-eszterhas-letter-mel-gibson-36949" platform="highweb"/> </link> .

In it, he accused Gibson of never having any intention to make the film.

"I believe you announced the project with great fanfare - 'a Jewish Braveheart' - in an attempt to deflect continuing charges of anti-Semitism which have dogged you, charges which have crippled your career," he wrote.

**'Substandard first draft'**

He also accused the actor of using offensive terms including "hebes", "oven-dodgers" and "Jewboys" to describe Jewish people during their time working together.

Eszterhas - who is best known for writing Basic Instinct - added, "I became increasingly worried that I'd made a grave mistake hooking up with you".

"I felt trapped. I couldn't legally or morally take it from you.

"I was hoping that the power of the story would overcome your anti-semitic prejudices."

Gibson responded to the allegations <link> <caption>in his own letter</caption> <url href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/04/mel-gibson-responds-to-the-hateful-e-mail-that-joe-eszterhass-leaked/" platform="highweb"/> </link> , saying: "I would have thought that a man of principle, as you purport to be, would have withdrawn from the project regardless of the money if you truly believed me to be the person you describe in your letter."

"I guess you only had a problem with me after Warner Brothers rejected your script."

The actor added he still wanted to make the movie, just not based on Eszterhas' script.

"Both Warner Brothers and I were extraordinarily disappointed with the draft," he said.

"In 25 years of script development I have never seen a more substandard first draft or a more significant waste of time. The success of the revolt is celebrated today by the Hanukkah festival.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

    The heads of the US and Israeli spy agencies - the CIA and Mossad - are due to meet with the Qatari prime minister today in Doha, according to the Reuters news agency, which cites an official who has been briefed on the talks.
    
    Qatar has been acting as a mediator between Israel and Hamas for ceasefire and hostage-release talks and the US and Egypt have also been leading negotiations to end the war.
    
    The talks follow the Israeli prime minister's office announcing earlier this week that the head of Mossad had been directed to head to Doha, following "meetings that were held in Cairo".
    
    This is an apparent reference to reports that an Egyptian delegation met with Hamas leaders there as part of efforts to resume negotiations.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded, there is no evidence to support the assertion that he fled to Poland. In fact, reports indicate that Netanyahu remained in Israel and was present at events following the attack, such as a memorial ceremony on October 7, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/).

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources describe the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which was completed in 2009. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, features a bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame and includes a remnant from the Twin Towers. The memorial also has plaques with the names of the victims. <image:50> <image:2231> <image:2232> <image:2233> <image:2234> <image:2235> <image:2236>

The memorial is located in Jerusalem Park and honors the victims of the September 11 attacks, including five Israelis.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks. However, the evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if there are other 9/11 memorials located outside of the United States.

On February 3, 2002, during the halftime show of [Super Bowl XXXVI](/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVI "Super Bowl XXXVI")
, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)
 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

On September 11, 2002, the documentary play _[Bystander 9/11](/wiki/Bystander_9/11 "Bystander 9/11")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

### The sole survivor of her family

The baby's mother, her father Shukri Jouda, and toddler sister Malak — Arabic for angel — were also killed in the Israeli airstrike that hit the family's home in Rafah, according to information from the hospital morgue and extended family.

The day after the strike that killed the family, the baby's [uncle, Rami al-Sheikh, told cameras](https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-sabreen-jouda-the-baby-girl-saved-from-dead-mothers-womb-in-gaza-dies-13123248#:~:text=Sabreen%20Jouda%20was%20born%20prematurely,care%20unit%20at%20another%20hospital.)
 he was ready to care for her. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since then, according to Gaza health officials.

Hisham al-Sayed's mother holds up a photograph of her son in April 2016

**Palestinian militant group Hamas has released a video appearing to show an Israeli citizen being held captive in the Gaza Strip.**

The clip appears to show Hisham al-Sayed lying in a bed looking dazed and wearing an oxygen mask - the first sighting of him since 2015.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said releasing a video of a sick man was "reprehensible and desperate."

The BBC has not been able to independently verify the footage.

Hamas alleges that Mr al-Sayed is an Israeli soldier, but both the Israeli government and his family say he is a civilian with mental health problems.

The charity Human Rights Watch, which has criticised Mr al-Sayed's "unlawful detention" in the past, says he was last seen walking into the Gaza Strip in April 2015 for unknown reasons, having made similar attempts to cross the frontier in the past.

In the video released by Hamas the 34-year-old, who is a member of Israel's Bedouin Arab minority, could be seen lying attached to a ventilator beside what appeared to be his Israeli-issued ID card.

A television monitor also in the room showed news footage from an economic conference in Qatar earlier this month.

No further details were given by the Palestinian militant group about the detainee's condition other than a reference on Monday to his health having deteriorated.

Israel says he is one of two citizens, the second being Avera Mengistu, currently being held captive by Hamas in violation of international law.

Both are believed to have crossed willingly into the Gaza Strip despite Israel banning its citizens from entering the Palestinian enclave.

There was some suggestion that the video's release was an attempt by Hamas to pressure Israel into resuming prisoner swap negotiations.

The two sides have engaged in prisoner swaps in the past, most notably in 2011 when abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.

How Israel’s war on Gaza has cut Palestinian life expectancy
============================================================

Israeli attacks have caused secondary deaths from malnutrition and disease among others, as well as affecting vulnerable groups including pregnant women

A wounded Palestinian girl is brought into Nasser hospital after Israeli strikes on Khan Younis in December 2023 (Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters)

[](#main-content)

By [MEE staff](/users/mee-staff "View user profile.")

Published date: 24 April 2025 11:37 BST | Last update: 4 months ago

It is 18 months since [Israel](https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel)
 declared [war on Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-war-gaza)
, following the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023, which killed more than 1,100 people.

At the time of writing, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 100,000 injured from a pre-war population of 2.2 million. And on 13 April, Israel bombed [al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-bombs-one-last-functioning-hospitals-gaza)
, Gaza’s last fully functioning hospital.

More than 90 percent of health facilities in Gaza sustained some damage throughout 2024.

Witnesses to the attack on the al-Ahli al-Arabi Baptist Hospital said the Israeli military gave staff and patients, some of who were in intensive care, 18 minutes to leave.

![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)A doctor from the Red Crescent told MEE that medical staff now had to send displaced patients to other hospitals which themselves had limited care.

"All the hospitals are overcrowded and are unprepared for providing full medical services,” he said. Israel has also blockaded supplies of aid and other essentials into [Gaza since 2 March](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-blocks-all-aid-entering-gaza-following-end-first-phase-ceasefire)
.

The Palestinian dead have come from all age groups: women, children and the elderly account for 56 percent of those killed.

That high level of fatalities has also slashed the average life expectancy of Palestinians, according to a [study in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02810-1/abstract)
.

For Palestinian men, the drop in average life expectancy has been 51.6 percent to 40.5 years during the first 12 months of the war - that’s a loss of 34.9 years of life. 

For Palestinian women, it has been a cut of 38.6 percent to an average life expectancy of 47.5 years - a loss of 29.9 years. Before the war, agriculture, according to the [UN Food and Agriculture Organisation](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/FAO-gaza-emergency-relief-food-production/en)
, accounted for “approximately 10 percent of Gaza’s economy, with more than 560,000 people relying entirely or partially on cropping, herding, or fishing for their livelihoods”.

More importantly, agriculture allowed Palestinians to feed themselves. 

That stopped with the war, as [fishing fleets](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:aff5befe-3f73-48d4-af91-201f2fcc4bf1)
, [fields](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:b2096872-9c89-42cd-8fef-eb778f097cef)
, [greenhouses](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/damage-greenhouses-due-conflict-gaza-strip-31st-december-2024#:~:text=56.5%20percent%20of%20Gaza%20Strip's,it%20the%20most%20affected%20governorate)
 and other [necessities for](https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/09e7c2a2-6a31-4ac4-88c9-deb023f14a10)
 food production were devastated by Israeli attacks.

![Food production losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza%20food%20production%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=-Hxm_-tM)

The scarcity of food has been reflected in high prices: for example, in [Deir al-Balah Governorate](https://www.solidarites.org/en/?s=gaza)
 in central Gaza, food prices soared between October 2023 and December 2024, including a kilogram of flour (1,058 by percent), tomatoes (956 percent), cucumbers (752 percent), lentils (360 percent) and rice (142 percent) among others.

In April 2025, Gaza’s [bakery owners’ association](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-bakeries-forced-close-gaza-due-lack-flour-and-fuel)
, announced that they had all shut due to a lack of flour and fuel because of Israel’s blockade.

Likewise, livestock has been hit: [milk production](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2024/02/01/gaza-fresh-milk-supply/)
, for example, has almost halted on occasion, while meat is hard to come by.

![Livestock losses in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/Gaza-livestock-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=4F0cszaN)

Farmer Faraj Jarudat, a farmer from northern Gaza, [told The Guardian in November 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/gaza-food-production-decimated-70-per-cent-farmland-hit)
 that he used to own three cows and 60 sheep. “There is not a single one left.”

The farm and his home, he was told by friends and former neighbours, had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.

### Malnutrition in Gaza

The lack of food that has been a constant during Israel’s war on Gaza has brought with it malnutrition.

In April 2024, Oxfam reported that Palestinians in northern Gaza were surviving on an average of 245 calories per day, or [less than one can of fava beans](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/palestinians-northern-gaza-living-less-can-beans-day-report-says)
. My face is pale and I’ve lost a lot of weight.”

The Palestinian population has often been driven to extreme measures, such as [eating grass](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-are-being-forced-eat-grass-heres-what-it-does-your-body)
, which is indigestible for humans, causes diarrhoea and vomiting, and has negligible nutritional value. On other occasions, [animal fodder](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinians-forced-mix-animal-fodder-flour-make-bread)
 has been used to make bread.

Many NGOs, charities, and other agencies use the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or [IPC](https://www.ipcinfo.org/)
 to analyse food security and nutrition. The scale runs from 1 (none/minimal) to 5 (catastrophe/famine).

![Malnutrition in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-malnutrition-graphic.jpg.webp?itok=Q_cCAFdK)

In February 2025, it was estimated that at least 60,000 children in Gaza will need treatment for [acute malnutrition](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-4-february-2025-1500)
 in the coming year.

There have already been instances of child fatalities, including [Azzam al-Shaer](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-on-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-malnutrition-gaza-hunger-crisis-rages)
, who died in June 2024; and [Yazan al-Kafarna](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-palestinian-child-dies-hunger-and-malnutrition-gaza)
, who died in March 2024.

Yazan was born with cerebral palsy, meaning he had to follow a special diet and take supplements. Human waste is one of the many forms of pollution in Gaza, attracting mosquitoes that in turn can spread disease.

![Sanitation in Gaza](/sites/default/files/styles/article_page/public/gaza-sanitation%20graphic.jpg.webp?itok=lM4cHkaX)

Homeless Palestinians, who usually live in tents, have little protection against insect bites and their serious effects.

In May 2024, [Omar Nasser described to MEE](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/war-gaza-overflowing-waste-threatens-health-crisis-hepatitis-spread)
 how his daughter Gada, then aged nine, had contracted hepatitis A, a liver infection that is transmitted through solid human waste and can be caught from coming into contact with unclean water or eating food handled by an infected person.

Nasser took his daughter to hospital, where a doctor prescribed some medications and a nutritional diet, which Nasser could not provide as he is unemployed.

"The doctor said she must not eat canned food, but it's the only food we get from the aid organisations," he said. “I’ve had to ask people for food to provide for my daughter.”

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

[Israel's war on Gaza](/topics/israel-war-gaza)

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers. More about MEE can be found [here](https://middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye)

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."

Al-Haq ([https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html](https://www.alhaq.org/monitoring-documentation/6941.html)) reported an incident from December 28, 2011, where an Israeli soldier unleashed a dog on a woman. <image:2790>

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.

The China Daily image can be found here: [Source](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2007-03/22/content_833702.htm). The Al Jazeera video can be found here: [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli army dogs have attacked Palestinian women. The Middle East Eye article ([https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-dog-mauled-palestinian-pregnant-woman-then-she-lost-baby)) reports an attack in late October 2023. Al Jazeera also has a video about an attack on an elderly Palestinian woman ([https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman](https://www.aljazeera.com/video/newsfeed/2024/6/26/video-israeli-military-dog-attacks-elderly-palestinian-woman)).

However, the provided evidence does not verify the authenticity of the specific image in the claim. The image search results do not include the same image.

Therefore, the claim is unverified due to the lack of evidence to support the authenticity of the image.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
