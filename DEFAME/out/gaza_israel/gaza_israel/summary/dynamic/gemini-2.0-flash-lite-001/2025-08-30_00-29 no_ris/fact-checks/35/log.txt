Useful result: From [Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/09/29/the-ring-photo-is-old-and-does-not-belong-to-hassan-nasrallah/): 
Content: The image shows the remains of a ring. The source states that the photo is old and does not belong to Hassan Nasrallah. <image:9446>

Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/obituary-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-2da3789a02fd4e2e88511a7f59174d19): 
Content: The Associated Press published an obituary of Nasrallah. The obituary includes a picture of Nasrallah wearing a ring. <image:9447>

Useful result: From [Source](https://dfrac.org/en/2024/09/30/do-the-remains-in-viral-image-belong-to-deceased-hezbollah-supremo/): 
Content: The image shows the remains of a ring and a piece of paper. The source is from September 30, 2024. The image was posted on January 5, 2024. <image:9448>

The claim '<image:24> This image shows the remains of Nasrallah's ring after being killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While news sources such as [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25279/israels-military-says-it-killed-hezbollah-leader) and The Washington Post confirm that Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut on September 28, 2024, the image of the ring's remains is not related to Nasrallah. Multiple sources, including [Kashif](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2024/09/29/the-ring-photo-is-old-and-does-not-belong-to-hassan-nasrallah/), state that the image is old and does not belong to Nasrallah.

So, the overall veracity is: false
