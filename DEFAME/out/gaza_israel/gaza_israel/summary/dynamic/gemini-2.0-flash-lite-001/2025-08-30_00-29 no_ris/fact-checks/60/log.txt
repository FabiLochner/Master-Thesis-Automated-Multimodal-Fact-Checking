Useful result: From [Source](https://fox47.com/news/local/hamas-accepts-cease-fire-proposal-for-gaza-but-israels-stance-still-uncertain): 
Content: The search result from fox47.com includes an image of an explosion over a building, credited to MAHMOD HAMS. <image:9613>

The claim '<image:35> This image shows an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While there were indeed Israeli attacks on Lebanon on that date, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan), the image itself, credited to MAHMOD HAMS, is associated with Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip, according to image search results.

So, the overall veracity is: false
