Content: The CNN article, published on August 20, 2025, discusses Israel's plans to call up tens of thousands of reservists for a military operation in Gaza City. <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>.

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check found no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While the US is involved in the conflict, and there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, a source explicitly states that there is no US military draft ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)).
