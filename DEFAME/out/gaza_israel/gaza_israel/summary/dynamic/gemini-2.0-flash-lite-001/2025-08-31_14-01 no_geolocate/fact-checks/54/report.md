### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. government is offering charter flights to help Americans leave Israel, with options to Athens or Frankfurt by air, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. Americans will be asked to sign an agreement to repay the U.S. government. The State Department has begun "assisted departure flights" for U.S. citizens and lawful residents out of Israel. The U.S. State Department has placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory. ![image 9577](media/2025-08-30_00-59-1756515584-362178.jpg), ![image 9595](media/2025-08-30_01-00-1756515603-202049.jpg), ![image 9596](media/2025-08-30_01-00-1756515603-341271.jpg)

## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering loans to U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon due to the conflict with Israel, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel)), Texas Standard ([https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/)), and KQED ([https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region](https://www.kqed.org/news/12008953/leave-lebanon-now-what-assistance-is-available-for-u-s-citizens-in-the-region)).

The U.S. government is also providing "assisted departure flights" for U.S. citizens and lawful residents out of Israel, as reported by Reuters, Newsweek, and CBS News. However, the evidence does not mention chartered flights for Israeli citizens.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported. The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon and is providing assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans to leave Lebanon and is providing assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel. However, the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year is not supported by the evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The U.S. government is offering loans to U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon amid escalating tensions, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140168/u-s-citizens-are-advised-to-lease-lebanon-amid-conflict-with-israel)), and is also providing assisted departure flights for U.S. citizens from Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that the U.S. government has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights.
