## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel and Euronews both reported on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where protesters carried mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to represent hostages held in Gaza. The protesters demanded a deal for the release of the hostages. The Euronews article includes the image of the coffins, which is the same as the one in the claim (![image 49](media/80.jpg)). The BBC article from February 20, 2025, discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages.

### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israel_hostage_deal_protests): 
Content: The search result is from Wikipedia and discusses the September 2024 Israel hostage deal protests. The protests began on September 1, 2024, after the Israel Defense Forces stated it had recovered six dead hostages. Protests occurred in Israel, including Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem, with demonstrators carrying prop coffins. The Histadrut, Israel's largest trade union, announced a one-day strike. The government responded with a rare apology from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ![image 49](media/80.jpg) is not mentioned in the search result.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially accurate. The image depicts mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv in September 2024. The protest was related to the Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The coffins were not for dead Israeli soldiers, but rather a symbolic representation of the hostages.


## Final Judgement
The image shows mock coffins used in a protest in Tel Aviv in September 2024, not coffins of dead Israeli soldiers. The protest was related to the Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

`false`
