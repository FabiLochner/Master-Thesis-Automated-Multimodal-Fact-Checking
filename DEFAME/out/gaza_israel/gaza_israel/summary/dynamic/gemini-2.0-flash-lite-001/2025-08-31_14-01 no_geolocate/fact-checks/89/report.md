The article does not mention Israeli intelligence tracking Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

Another source from bne Gulf bureau reports that WhatsApp may have given away the location of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran on July 31, 2024, suggesting spyware on his phone through his WhatsApp account enabled location tracking ([https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/)) ![image 4643](media/2025-08-23_01-07-1755911275-462094.jpg).

The Guardian published an article on April 3, 2024, discussing the use of AI by Israeli intelligence to identify Hamas targets in Gaza, but it does not mention Ismail Haniyeh or WhatsApp ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes)) ![image 4657](media/2025-08-23_01-08-1755911291-919292.jpg), ![image 4658](media/2025-08-23_01-08-1755911292-467848.jpg).
