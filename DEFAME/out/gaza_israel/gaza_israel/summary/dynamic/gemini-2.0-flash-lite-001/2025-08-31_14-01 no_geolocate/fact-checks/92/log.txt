Useful result: From [Source](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-palestinians-evacuation-27-july-2024-c95e8effebd9d4e4ba7e69bfbae61e04): 
Content: The Associated Press published an article on July 27, 2024, reporting on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip. The article includes multiple images of the aftermath, including a child inspecting the rubble <image:k>. The article states that the airstrike killed at least 30 people, including children.

The claim '<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim depicts a Syrian child, Sham, rescued from the rubble after an earthquake in February 2023, as confirmed by reverse image searches and articles from Enab Baladi ([https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2023/03/shams-journey-from-under-the-rubble-to-abu-dhabis-burjeel-hospital/)), UAE Times, and El País. The claim incorrectly associates the image with a Palestinian child in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.

So, the overall veracity is: false
