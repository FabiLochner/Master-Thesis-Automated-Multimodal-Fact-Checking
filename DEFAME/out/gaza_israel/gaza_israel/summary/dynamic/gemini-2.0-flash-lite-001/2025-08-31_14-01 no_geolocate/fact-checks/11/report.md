### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli army base near Binyamina, Israel. The attack resulted in the death of four Israeli soldiers and injuries to dozens more.

## Elaboration
The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack is false. A Yahoo News article, originally from USA TODAY, explicitly states that the claim is false and includes photos of Halevi visiting the military base after the drone attack. The drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, on an Israeli army base near Binyamina, resulting in the death of four soldiers and injuries to dozens more.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack is demonstrably false. Multiple reliable sources, including a Yahoo News article, confirm that the claim is false and provide evidence, such as photos of Halevi visiting the military base after the attack. The drone attack did occur, but Halevi was not killed.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, the IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, was not assassinated. A fact-check by Yahoo News, originally from USA TODAY, explicitly states that the claim is false and provides evidence, including photos of Halevi visiting the base after the attack ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-israels-defense-chief-not-213141242.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-israels-defense-chief-not-213141242.html)).
