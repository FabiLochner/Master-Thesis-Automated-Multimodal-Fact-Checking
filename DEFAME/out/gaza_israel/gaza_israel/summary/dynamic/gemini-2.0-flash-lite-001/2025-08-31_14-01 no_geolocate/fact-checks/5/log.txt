Useful result: From [Source](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east): Found exact image on website with title: Gaza under fire: Israeli jets strike Hamas targets after Tel Aviv attack
Content: The search result from Arab News PK contains an image of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares over the Gaza Strip on March 25, 2019. <image:6>. The article is titled "Gaza under fire: Israeli jets strike Hamas targets after Tel Aviv attack" and was updated on March 26, 2019.

The claim '<image:6> This image shows an Israeli helicopter shot down by Hezbollah amid clashes in Southern Lebanon on November 23, 2024.' is false.
