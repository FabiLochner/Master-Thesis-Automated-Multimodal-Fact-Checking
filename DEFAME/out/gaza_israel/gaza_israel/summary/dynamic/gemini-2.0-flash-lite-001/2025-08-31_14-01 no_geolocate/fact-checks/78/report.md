## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Several news articles from January 2025 discuss Poland's plans to protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest. These articles, including those from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)), the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)), and DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)), report on the context of an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Netanyahu. <image:k> <image:k> <image:k>

The articles focus on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and whether Netanyahu would attend. The DW.COM article also mentions an opinion poll regarding the situation.


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, which is discussed in articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The Wikipedia article refers to the attack as "Operation True Promise II" and mentions that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" and vowed that Iran "will pay" for it.

The NPR article notes that Israel shot down most of the Iranian missiles and mentions an Israeli ground offensive in Lebanon. The Al Jazeera article states that the attack was in response to Israeli attacks and assassinations and also includes Netanyahu's reaction. <image:i>, ![image 281](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-334464.jpg), ![image 282](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-506528.jpg), <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, the provided sources do not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland on that date.

The articles about Poland protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest are from January 2025, which is several months after the missile attack. These articles discuss the context of an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu, but they do not provide any information about his whereabouts during the October 1, 2024, attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not contain information about Netanyahu's location on October 1, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Reuters reported that Benjamin Netanyahu was in Jerusalem, Israel, where he stated that Iran's missile attack on Israel failed and vowed retaliation. ![image 12844](media/2025-08-31_15-00-1756652407-266827.jpg) The Guardian published an article on the same day discussing how Netanyahu has weathered the storm since the Hamas attack, but it does not mention him leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland. ![image 12832](media/2025-08-31_14-59-1756652387-597400.jpg) A Wikipedia article discusses a drone attack on Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024, and also mentions the October 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel. <image:k>


## Elaboration
The claim is false. On October 1, 2024, Netanyahu was in Jerusalem, Israel, responding to the Iranian missile attack. There is no evidence to support the claim that he left Israel and fled to Poland on that date.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results confirmed the Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Netanyahu responded to it. However, they did not mention him leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland. Subsequent searches revealed that Netanyahu was in Jerusalem on that date. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is demonstrably false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), evidence from Reuters indicates that Netanyahu was in Jerusalem, Israel, on that date, not in Poland.
