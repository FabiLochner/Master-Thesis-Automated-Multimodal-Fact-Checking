Useful result: From [Source](https://loudwire.com/roger-waters-calls-out-u2-bono-israel-tribute/): 
Content: The Loudwire article discusses Roger Waters' criticism of Bono for a tribute to the victims of the Hamas-led attack in Israel. <image:12679> The article does not mention a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.

The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unsubstantiated. While there is evidence of collaborations between Bono and Bob Geldof, and criticism of Bono's actions related to Israel, the search results from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Geldof) and [Dublin Live](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394) do not mention a tour in November 2024. Furthermore, a Loudwire article discusses Roger Waters' criticism of Bono, but not the claimed tour.

So, the overall veracity is: false
