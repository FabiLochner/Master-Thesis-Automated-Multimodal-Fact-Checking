### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 9, 2024, Houthi rebels targeted a U.S.-flagged container ship, the Maersk Sentosa, in the Gulf of Aden, according to a report by PBS News ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/houthi-rebels-target-u-s-flagged-container-ship-off-coast-of-yemen](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/houthi-rebels-target-u-s-flagged-container-ship-off-coast-of-yemen)). The captain reported an explosion near the vessel off the coast of Yemen. ![image 12572](media/2025-08-31_14-21-1756650079-011388.jpg) CENTCOM also reported that Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists fired missiles at the U.S.-flagged container ship M/V Maersk Detroit in the Gulf of Aden ([https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3654573/houthis-attack-commercial-shipping-vessel-with-anti-ship-missiles/](https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/PRESS-RELEASES/Press-Release-View/Article/3654573/houthis-attack-commercial-shipping-vessel-with-anti-ship-missiles/)).

The Wikipedia article "Attacks on the MV Maersk Hangzhou" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_the_MV_Maersk_Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_the_MV_Maersk_Hangzhou)) mentions attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including the MV Maersk Hangzhou.


## Elaboration
The claim that a US-flagged vessel was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024 is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources confirm that the Maersk Sentosa, a US-flagged container ship, was targeted by Houthi rebels in the Gulf of Aden on July 9, 2024. Additionally, the M/V Maersk Detroit, another US-flagged container ship, was attacked with missiles in the Gulf of Aden.

The evidence also indicates that a Singapore-flagged vessel was attacked in the Gulf of Aden on July 19, 2024. However, this does not contradict the claim about the US-flagged vessel.

The evidence does not include a direct quote from a Maersk spokesperson. Therefore, the part of the claim that mentions a Maersk spokesperson needs further verification.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially true. Multiple sources confirm that a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, was attacked in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. However, the claim also includes a quote from a Maersk spokesperson, which is not directly verified by the provided evidence.

`true`


### Verdict: TRUE
