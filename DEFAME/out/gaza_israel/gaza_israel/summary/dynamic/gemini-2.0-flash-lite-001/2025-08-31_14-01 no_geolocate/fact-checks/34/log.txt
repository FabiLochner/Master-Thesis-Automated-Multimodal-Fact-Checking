Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran): 
Content: The Guardian reports that Israel launched airstrikes against military targets in Iran on October 26, 2024, in retaliation for attacks against Israel. <image:1282> The article mentions explosions in Tehran and nearby Karaj.

The claim '<image:23> This image shows Israel bombing Tehran on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a fire at an oil refinery near Tehran from June 2, 2021, as reported by The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/huge-fire-at-refinery-near-tehran-extinguished-after-20-hours-report/)). While there were Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on October 26, 2024, as reported by CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-lebanon-gaza-war-10-26-24)), the image is unrelated to those events.

So, the overall veracity is: false
