Useful result: From [Source](https://harapandaily.com/2025/06/17/middle-east-on-the-brink-gaza-israel-iran/): Found exact image on website with title: Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran - Harapan Daily
Content: The image <image:649> is found on Harapan Daily, in an article titled "Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran". The article discusses the Israeli aggression against Gaza, the role of the United States and the West, and the Iranian factor. The article mentions an Iranian drone and missile operation targeting Israeli military installations in April 2024.

The claim '<image:8> This image shows Israel launching several waves of revengeful attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is associated with events in Syria and Oregon, and also with an article discussing the Israeli aggression against Gaza, as evidenced by a reverse image search. The image is dated October 22, 2024, which contradicts the claim's date of October 26, 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.
