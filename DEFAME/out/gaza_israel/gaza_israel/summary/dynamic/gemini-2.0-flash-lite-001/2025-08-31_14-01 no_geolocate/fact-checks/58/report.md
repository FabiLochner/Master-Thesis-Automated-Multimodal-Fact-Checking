## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip states that nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. It also mentions that as of January 2025, Israel had destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries. The UN News article from April 22, 2025, states that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. The destruction of heavy machinery has halted rescue and recovery efforts, making it difficult to reach the estimated 11,000 bodies still trapped under the debris. ![image 33](media/58.jpg)
