Useful result: From [Source](https://mondoweiss.net/2025/01/im-looking-through-the-skulls-to-find-my-sons-palestinians-dig-through-gazas-rubble-to-search-for-their-missing-loved-ones/): 
Content: The Mondoweiss article from January 2025, discusses Palestinians searching for missing loved ones in Gaza's rubble and includes an image of a human skull and bones next to a shoe <image:12543>.

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is AI-generated, as confirmed by a reverse image search and a source from kashif.ps ([https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/ai-generated-image-of-woman-hugging-skeleton-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)), which explicitly identifies the image as such. Therefore, the claim is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
