Useful result: From [Source](https://www.siasat.com/trump-netanyahu-meeting-focuses-on-hostages-saudi-relations-iran-threats-3175717/): Found exact image on website with title: Trump, Netanyahu meeting focuses on hostages, Saudi relations ...
Content: The search result from Siasat.com contains the image <image:16> and reports on a meeting between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington. The article is dated February 4, 2025.

The claim '<image:16> This is an authentic image of Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu and Elon Musk during Netanyahu's official visit to the U.S. in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, as confirmed by a reverse image search that found the same image in an article on siasat.com, which reported on a meeting between the two. However, the evidence does not mention Elon Musk being present at the meeting, making the claim that the image shows all three individuals unverified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
