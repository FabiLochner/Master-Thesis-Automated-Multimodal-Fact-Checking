The article was published on the website of a law firm.

The claim 'It is illegal to do a DNA test in Israel.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a law firm's website ([pz-law.co.il](https://pz-law.co.il/en/blog-en/repatriation-to-israel-via-a-dna-test/)), indicates that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes to establish Jewish identity. While regulations and restrictions may apply, the practice itself is not illegal.

So, the overall veracity is: false
