Content: The Suburban published an article about a legal action against Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante regarding pro-Palestinian electronic signs. The signs, which displayed messages like "Free Palestine," were used by activists. The article includes an image of a sign that says "INTIFADA NOW" <image:12566>. The legal action was initiated by Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi, who contends that Plante's negligence has enabled the spread of hate and violence. The article also mentions that the signs belong to a private contractor.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.readthemaple.com/city-of-montreal-illegally-seized-pro-palestine-signs-activists-allege/): 
Content: The article from The Maple, published on September 5, 2024, discusses the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election. The signs were put up by LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), a registered third-party campaign group. The article mentions that the City has been ordered to pay damages in the past for similar incidents. The article includes a tweet from Jeremy Levi, the mayor of Hampstead, who called the signs "hate propaganda." <image:13>

Useful result: From [Source](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs): 
Content: The Montreal Gazette published an article on July 26, 2024, reporting that electronic roadwork billboards in Montreal displayed anti-Israel messages, including "Free Palestine," "Escalate Now," and "Globalize the Intifada." <image:13> The mayor of Hampstead threatened legal action against Montreal's mayor, Valérie Plante, due to the messages. Montreal officials stated the signs were vandalized, with unauthorized messages overriding the original city messages.

The claim '<image:13> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially inaccurate. While electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed "Free Palestine" and other pro-Palestinian slogans, the evidence indicates that the city considered this an act of vandalism, and there is no evidence that Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante authorized the messages; in fact, legal action was taken against her regarding the signs, as reported by the [Montreal Gazette](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-mayor-warned-to-act-on-anti-israel-messages-on-road-signs) and [The Suburban](https://www.thesuburban.com/news/city_news/plante-served-over-pro-palestinian-electronic-signs/article_e0143fdc-d532-5ecf-9a66-095ad0ee8ab9.html).

So, the overall veracity is: false
