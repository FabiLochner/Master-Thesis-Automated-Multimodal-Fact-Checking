The uniform in the photo was retired in 2019, and there is no record of a US Army General named John Pagri. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.
",True,"A reverse image search reveals the photograph was uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, a website that collects free-use images, with a description that says that it was taken in 2007 in Iraq's Babil province (archived here). Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here). Several US media outlets published images of Doman from his service in Iraq, which are similar to those used in the social media posts (archived here)."

",True,"However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic. He, too, noted differences in the shape of the prime minister's ear compared to the one seen in the posts."
7,The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.,False,False,"The claim is false. While there was a ceasefire and a pledge to stop attacking ships, the Houthis continued attacks after Trump's election, as evidenced by attacks on ships and the Tel Aviv airport, according to sources like the [ABC News article](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774) and the [Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis).

However, the ICJ did not declare Israel an ""illegal state,"" as the claim suggests.
",True,"The court had instead found Israel's decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory as unlawful and said it should come to an end ""as rapidly as possible"". The ICJ said Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian territories was against international law, in a nonbinding advisory opinion issued on July 19 on the request of the UN General Assembly. In June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem, at the time annexed by Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt."

While there were attacks in Baghdad and escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah around September 30, 2024, the image in question has not been directly linked to a US facility attack on that date. The image search results show attacks on US facilities in Baghdad, but none of the images match the original one.
",True,"However, photos shared online do not show the strike -- they were taken years ago in the United States and the Gaza Strip and have repeatedly been used to spread misinformation. A reverse image search reveals the first picture -- a close-up view of an explosion near a building -- was taken in 2011 by photographer Tim Wynkoop for The Express-Times newspaper at a gas facility in the US state of New Jersey (archived here). ""A (sic) explosion tonight at Linde Electronics and Specialty Gas in Alpha sends a fireball into the night sky,"" the caption says.

Multiple sources, including an NPR article ([https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197958398](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1197958398)), confirm that James Baldwin stated, ""It was created for the salvation of the Western interests."" This quote is also found in Baldwin's ""Open Letter to the Born Again"" (September 29, 1979).

The CIA’s World Factbook says its population data is from the U.S. Census Bureau. A Census Bureau spokesperson told PolitiFact that if the World Factbook used census data for population growth rates, the data would come from the international population estimates and projections released in August 2023, before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The United Nations reported in July that Gaza’s current population decreased by 200,000 from the region’s projected 2024 population.

While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an attempted assassination of him on July 13, 2024, the evidence does not support the specific quote attributed to him.

Hajjaj told Misbar he took the photo two days earlier at Al-Ahli Arab Baptist Hospital, where Sham was treated after an Israeli attack targeted her family’s house in the Shuja’iyya neighborhood. He confirmed that Sham lost her right arm and died the following day due to the severity of her injuries. Nahed also posted footage of baby Sham on his Instagram account two days ago, providing details about the Israeli airstrike that targeted her family."

While the evidence confirms significant destruction in Gaza, with nearly 80-92% of buildings damaged or destroyed by July 2025, the image's date and location are not verified. The geolocation suggests the image was most likely taken in Jordan.
",True," Aerial Footage Shows the Destruction in Zamalka City, in Syria. The video includes an Arabic phrase, which upon translation, indicates that the footage does not show Gaza. After selecting the text, using the translation option in Google reverse image search, Google Translate showed that the Arabic phrase means, “Aerial shots of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside,” not Gaza as claimed. The video ends with the logo of the Syria TV channel, casting further doubt on the claim's validity. Upon searching for the keywords “Zamalka” and “Syria TV” in Arabic, Misbar’s team found the same video published on the Syria TV YouTube channel on Dec. 16, 2024, titled: “Aerial footage of the town of Zamalka in the Damascus countryside shows the massive destruction of its buildings.” The video showed several aerial shots of the Syrian city Zamalka, 10 kilometers away from the capital Damascus, where the city is completely destroyed and deserted."

",True," Iran is preparing to strike Israeli target from Iraqi territory, according to the Jerusalem Post. The plans are in response to attacks by Israel on Iranian soil, marking an escalation in the conflict, the outlet reported. The image accompanying this tweet is not recent. It originates from October 7, 2023, and has been repurposed to support claims of recent attacks. The specific details of the alleged ambush, including the use of bulldozers and explosives, have not been confirmed by credible sources. Independent military analysts and organizations tracking the conflict have not corroborated the incident or reported similar activity matching this description in recent days. Furthermore, while it is possible for older images to resurface in military contexts, this image has been previously used in unrelated posts, weakening the tweet’s credibility. Notably, accounts such as @sentdefender, @ozraeliavi, and @Global_Mil_Info, highlight that the accompanying photo lacks context and should not be used as evidence of the tweet’s claims, or at least confirm that the photos are not new.

The image dates back to 2000 and depicts a woman using an Israeli tank that was left over in Lebanon after the IOF pulled back to the international border line, ending a 22-year occupation of south Lebanon. The image was published in a report on the website of the war-zone correspondent and political analyst of the events in the Middle East and North Africa Elijah J. Magnier, titled ""20 Years After the Unconditional Israeli Withdrawal from Lebanon: Where Are We?

",True," Photos Show Recent Pro-Palestine Protests in Bangladesh. Misbar’s investigation found that the photos, falsely claimed to show protests in India, capture pro-Palestine demonstrations in Bangladesh amid the ongoing Israeli war on Gaza. Misbar's team conducted a detailed reverse image search and traced the photos to Somoy TV, a Dhaka-based news outlet. Somoy TV originally uploaded the images on Facebook, stating they show protests held at Suhrawardy Udyan in support of Palestine. The post’s translated caption reads, “March for Gaza. Lakhs of people are gathering in processions at Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire area is filled with slogans.” Misbar’s team verified the location mentioned by several media outlets, Suhrawardy Udyan, and found that the park is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not India. By comparing the videos and photos shared of the pro-Palestine protests, Misbar's team found that they all feature the exact location in Bangladesh. Moreover, Misbar’s team searched for reports of recent pro-Palestine protests in India but found no evidence confirming that such demonstrations have occurred there recently."

",True," Image of Zelenskyy at a Plant Producing Ammunition for Ukraine. Misbar’s team found that the image shows Zelenskyy signing American bombs produced for Ukraine. A reverse image search led to a YouTube video published by AFP News Agency in September 2024. The video, which included frames similar to the viral image, showed Zelenskyy visiting an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania. According to AFP’s description, Zelenskyy visited the United States at the time to seek permission to use Western weapons against targets in Russia. At the 0:56 timestamp, a frame similar to the viral image can be seen. Several news outlets, including BBC and Yahoo News, featured the viral image in reports on Zelenskyy’s September 2024 visit to the United States, where he toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and discussed his “victory plan” to pressure Russia into a diplomatic resolution. AP News also featured the image in a report on Zelenskyy’s visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant. The outlet stated that his visit aimed to thank workers producing one of the most needed types of ammunition for Ukraine in its war with Russia. AP reported that Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition plant was intended to thank workers for manufacturing weapons for Ukraine. Finally, Briscs News published the image in September 2024, captioning that it showed Zelenskyy signing bombs intended for use against Russia. According to the official website of the Ukrainian president, the Army Ammunition Plant is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s ammunition needs, particularly for producing 155mm shells. "

",True," 2021 Israeli Airstrike on Gaza. Misbar's team found through reverse image search that the photo shows an Israeli airstrike on Gaza in April 2021. The photo was originally published by Agence France-Presse (AFP) and taken by the photographer Said Khatib. According to AFP’s caption, the photo showed the explosion of an Israeli airstrike on Rafah, a city in southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli Occupation Forces stated that the airstrike was conducted in response to a rocket launch from the Strip. The photographer also shared the photo to his Facebook account in April 2021, along with another picture of the same airstrike captured at a different moment. Additionally, several reputable outlets featured the photo in reports on the airstrike or analyses on the situation between Hamas and Israel, such as Haaretz and Middle East Eye. Middle East Eye reported that Israel struck two “training sites” in southern Gaza, which came hours after a rocket was fired into southern Israel. The rocket attack on Israel struck open ground and caused no casualties or damage, according to an Israeli spokesperson. It bears noting that the photo was previously misrepresented as an airstrike on Syria. In October 2022, the Jewish Press, an American news outlet, shared the photo falsely claiming that it showed an Israeli rocket attack on Damascus."

",False," President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a missile defense plan to defend the United States from ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles and other aerial threats, according to DefenseScoop. NewsNation and the New York Post reported on Trump’s missile defense executive order. NewsNation reported that “Iron Dome was 90% effective against ballistic missiles fired at Israel by Iran in October, which has prompted Trump to order the planning of a ‘state-of-the-art’ missile defense system to be designed in the United States.” The New York Post reported that the Iron Dome “blasts ballistic missiles out of the sky with an accuracy rate of roughly 90%.” Both of these claims are misleading. The Iron Dome is designed to shoot down rockets and other short-range munitions, such as mortar shells, according to the BBC. It is true that it has been reported that the Iron Dome has shot down 90% of rockets fired, per the BBC. However, the Iron Dome is not used to intercept ballistic missiles, per the BBC. Israel uses David’s Sling and the Arrows 2 and 3 systems to shoot down cruise and ballistic missiles, per the outlet. Furthermore, Israel used the Arrows 2 and 3 missile defense systems to intercept Iranian ballistic missiles during Iran’s October 2024 attack, according to Axios. In addition, the USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired a dozen anti-missile interceptors, per the outlet. "

No casualties were reported. According to the report, on Saturday morning, three drones were allegedly deployed from Lebanon in an assault aimed at the prime minister’s private home. Two of them were stopped near Rosh Hanikra and Nahariya, while the third detonated in Caesarea, a coastal town famous for its luxury homes and ancient Roman remains. At the time, the prime minister and his wife were away from the residence. We found similar updates in reports by India TV, Mint and India Today. None of them mentioned any casualties. Further, we checked Yair’s social media handles and analysed his online activity. We found that Yair Netanyahu's account is active on X. His latest activity was seen on October 21 with a repost of an interview of a Hezbollah leader. We also found Yair’s Instagram account. Although his last post was on October 7, he shared his latest status 10 hours ago. We checked Yair’s Facebook account; his last activity was on October 8. Hence, the claim that the Hezbollah drone attack on the Israeli PM’s home in Caesarea killed his son Yair Netanyahu is false."

While there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, the image search revealed that the image of tents on fire is from an NBC News article about an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, not related to the Iranian strikes.
",True," Israeli Airstrikes Spark Deadly Fire at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The circulating image depicts tents engulfed in flames at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on the night of October 14, following an Israeli airstrike that resulted in the deaths of four individuals and injuries to dozens more. The photo was taken by Palestinian journalist Ramadan Abd for Reuters. These scenes were reported by Arab and Western media and captured by journalists and activists in Gaza, who documented the charred bodies of the victims from the Israeli strike that targeted displaced individuals inside their tents. Eyewitnesses stated that medical teams evacuated several injured people while large portions of their clothing were ablaze. They noted that the fire burned for 45 minutes before civil defense teams successfully brought it under control. "

Fact-checkers from the Associated Press and Yahoo News have debunked the Facebook post attributed to Mel Gibson, finding it to be fake. They confirmed that Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.
",True," Although the purported post's format resembles a Facebook layout, Logically Facts did not locate any active official accounts for Mel Gibson on Facebook, X, or Instagram. Our search for recent reports regarding Gibson’s alleged statement yielded no relevant results. In 2006, Gibson apologized for antisemitic remarks made during his arrest for drunk driving in Los Angeles. Aside from that incident, there have been no recent statements from him concerning Israel amid the ongoing conflict involving Hamas and Iran. We have contacted Gibson’s publicist for a comment and will update the story upon receiving a response. It is noteworthy that this same screenshot went viral in 2023 and was debunked by Reuters and AP News. At that time, Gibson’s representative, Alan Nierob, confirmed, “It is a fake post, as Mr. Gibson does not have any social media platforms.”"
77,"Israel experienced an earthquake on October 5, 2024.",False,True,"Multiple sources, including the Johns Hopkins Hub and NDTV, report that an earthquake occurred in Israel on October 5, 2024.
",False," The claim is false. USGS data shows that no earthquake occurred in Israel on or shortly before October 5th. No credible sources have reported that an earthquake occurred near Tel Aviv around October 5th. The EMSC made a post on X that verifies there is no data that indicates an earthquake occurred in Israel around October 5th. The caption reads, “#Israel 19 min ago⚠ We have no data confirming this crowdsourced detection. 👉 It likely was a false detection. No more info will be displayed in the thread. ” When asked for comment, EMSC told Check Your Fact, “we stress the preliminary and unconfirmed nature of this detection. The second message in the thread confirms that this detection has not been confirmed.” Check Your Fact has also reached out to USGS for comment. Due to the tension between Israel and Iran, many social media users have attributed the false detection to an alleged Iranian nuclear test. No reputable sources have reported that Iran conducted a nuclear test on or close to October 5th. "
78,"Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.",False,False,"The claim is false. While an Iranian missile attack on Israel did occur on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland during the attack. Information about Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland is related to a later event in January 2025, as reported by [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next).
",True," Netanyahu’s Travel Claims Disproved During Iranian Missile Attack. Misbar’s team searched the viral claim and did not find any credible news media reporting on it. On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.

While reports confirm a Hezbollah attack on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, the image's authenticity remains unconfirmed. Reverse image and image searches did not provide evidence to support the claim.
",True," The image was not shared by any credible media outlet which reported on the strike of Ramat David, which raised suspicion of the authenticity of the image. After analyzing the photo, Misbar’s team found that the image in question is an AI-generated photo. There are several distortions and unclear outlines that could be noted in the photo."

",False," Israeli Protesters Carry Coffins During Protest in Tel Aviv. Contrary to the viral claim circulating on social media, the photo does not depict real coffins of Israeli soldiers amid the ongoing military campaigns. Similar images, showing the same location and individuals, were posted by The Jerusalem Post on X, identifying the scene as a protest at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. Misbar’s investigative team conducted a thorough comparison of the circulating image with the one shared by Israeli media and confirmed several similarities, including protesters wearing yellow, holding photos of Israeli hostages, the Israeli flag, objects on the building roof, and the presence of 27 coffins, arranged in three rows of nine. Sky News also shared a video showing Israeli protesters carrying coffins, reporting that the coffins represent hostages killed in Gaza. The outlet noted that widespread protests erupted across Israel following the recovery of six hostages' bodies from Gaza. Moreover, The Times of Israel shared a similar photo of the circulating photo showing the same location and number of coffins during the protest in Habima Square, Tel Aviv. "

",True," Numerous other countries, including Italy, England, Ireland and Australia, have 9/11 memorials. Israel is far from the only country outside of the U.S. with a memorial commemorating the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed 2,977 people. More than a dozen other nations have such sites, according to the Voices Center for Resilience and Memorial Mapping. Those nations include Italy, England, Ireland and Australia. "

",True," Israeli Government Officials Took Shelter in Bunkers on October 7. Media outlets published the image on October 7, 2023, claiming it showed Israeli government ministers rushing to shelters after sirens sounded in Tel Aviv amid escalating exchanges of fire between Palestinian resistance groups and the Israeli military.

A news report by The Times of Israel published on January 30, 2024, headlined, ""State approves repairs to pool in Netanyahu's Caesarea home – report,"" carried the same photo of the property. The image captioned, ""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea,"" was credited to Israeli public broadcaster KAN. The Times of Israel also used the photo for another article on Netanyahu's house published on July 19, 2024. Another report by Radio J, a French radio station that broadcasts information from the Jewish community, carried the same image in an article published on January 30, 2024, crediting the photo to KAN. Further, upon relevant Google searches in Hebrew, we found a video uploaded by KAN (archived here) on its YouTube channel on July 1, 2019, with the same visuals at the 0:07 timestamp. The video was originally titled in Hebrew and, when translated using Google, reads, ""The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works."" "

",True," A Doctored Screenshot of Channel 12 News’ 2022 Poll. Contrary to social media users’ viral circulation of the image, the screenshot was photoshopped, altering the original captioning of the poll behind the Israeli channel’s presenter. The poll, originally conducted by Channel 12 in May 2022, asked whether respondents agreed with the claim that the government's support leans on terror supporters. The original video showing Channel 12's presenter announcing the poll results was uploaded to YouTube on May 28, 2022. The translated caption of the Hebrew question from the Channel 12 poll reads, ""Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?"" Despite this, the image has been misrepresented on social media, with a false caption suggesting the poll asked if Israeli soldiers should be allowed to rape a prisoner."

The report stated that 20 NATO allies participated in the 53rd iteration of the Baltic Operations 2024 (BALTOPS) held in Kiel, Germany, on June 20, 2024. The report explains that allies gathered at the port in Kiel to reflect on the 21-day BALTOPS exercise that involved 50 ships, 85 aircraft, and nearly 9,000 personnel. The BALTOPS exercise started on June 8, 2024, in Lithuania and involved exercises by warships of NATO countries in the Baltic Sea.

The image caption reads, ""The presence of Haj Esmail Qaani in the #March_22_of_Bahman (Translated from Persian)."" The image shows Qaani wearing a black cap and black eyeglasses, not a burqa.

",False," WhatsApp Is Banned in Iran. Contrary to social media users’ spreading conspiracy theory regarding the assassination of Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh, Meta’s WhatsApp has not been working in Iran since 2022. As protests spread over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in Iran, access to Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked in September 2022. According to data from NetBlocks, authorities have responded with a series of internet restrictions, targeting all users registered with an Iranian (+98) phone number across all major network operators.

The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act.

The image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag is fabricated, as confirmed by multiple sources, including [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html) and [Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/).
",True," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "
99,<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.,False,False,"The claim is false. While there are documented instances of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim is a digitally created artwork, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it depicts an authentic event. Reverse image searches and web searches did not provide any information to verify the claim.
",True," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
