The claim '<image:11> This image shows a US factility come under attack in Baghdad on September 30, 2024 as the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah escalated.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were attacks in Baghdad and escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah around September 30, 2024, the image in question has not been directly linked to a US facility attack on that date. The image search results show attacks on US facilities in Baghdad, but none of the images match the original one.

So, the overall veracity is: false
