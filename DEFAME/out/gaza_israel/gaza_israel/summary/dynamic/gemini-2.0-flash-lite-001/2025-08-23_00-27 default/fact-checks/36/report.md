The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) reported that Yoav Gallant visited the Nevatim Airbase after an Iranian missile attack on October 1, 2024, and includes images of the aftermath of the attack ![image 3855](media/2025-08-23_00-38-1755909527-493851.jpg). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/biden-and-netanyahu-to-speak-as-israel-attack-on-iran-expected)) mentioned Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, warning of a "deadly, precise and surprising" attack after the October 1 attack.

NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) reported that Benjamin Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on November 5, 2024, and replaced him with Israel Katz ![image 3859](media/2025-08-23_00-38-1755909537-579979.jpg), ![image 3862](media/2025-08-23_00-38-1755909539-998672.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) shows that Yoav Gallant visited the Nevatim Airbase after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, indicating he was alive at that time. Furthermore, NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) reports that Gallant was fired on November 5, 2024, which also proves he was alive after the alleged date of his death.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, and was later fired from his position. The claim that he was killed in the attack is therefore false.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/)) shows Yoav Gallant visited a base after the attack on October 1, 2024, and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu)) reports he was fired on November 5, 2024, proving he was alive after the alleged date of death.
