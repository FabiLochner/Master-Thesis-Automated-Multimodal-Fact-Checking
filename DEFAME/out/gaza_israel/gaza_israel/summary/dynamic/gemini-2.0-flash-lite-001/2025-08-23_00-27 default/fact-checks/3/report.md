## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reported on February 23, 2025, that police found no evidence of Israeli settlements or business dominance in Pai District, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, and that 4,573 Israelis visited Pai. The Nation ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) published an article on February 18, 2025, refuting claims of an Israeli "promised land" in Pai district, stating that Israeli tourists visit legally and mentioning a Chabad House. Khaosod English ([https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) discussed fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai into an occupied land, with the Prime Minister assuring the public that the fears are unsubstantiated, and that there are only about 40 to 50 Jewish families residing in Pai.

The articles include images of Pai District, Israeli tourists, and police presence. ![image 530](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873148-834738.jpg), ![image 536](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873163-563040.jpg), ![image 534](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873161-060535.jpg), ![image 535](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873161-801096.jpg), ![image 532](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873158-950368.jpg), ![image 533](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873160-034061.jpg), ![image 540](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873171-303134.jpg), ![image 537](media/2025-07-18_21-12-1752873167-570258.jpg), ![image 4](media/3.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were concerns and discussions about Israelis in Pai District, Mae Hong Son, Thailand, in February 2025. The Bangkok Post ([https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai](https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2966381/no-israeli-settlement-or-business-dominance-found-in-northern-thailands-pai)) reported that police found no evidence of Israeli settlements. The Nation ([https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434](https://www.nationthailand.com/news/tourism/40046434)) refuted claims of an Israeli "promised land" in Pai. Khaosod English ([https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/](https://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2025/02/23/why-some-thais-fear-israelis-turning-pai-into-an-occupied-land/)) discussed fears among some Thais that Israelis are turning Pai into an occupied land.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm or deny the claim that the image shows Israelis who have stopped fighting wars and moved to become settlers. However, the evidence does show that there were concerns about Israelis in Pai District, and the image could be related to those concerns.

The claim's veracity cannot be fully determined without additional information. Specifically, it is unclear whether the people in the image are Israelis, and if so, whether they are settlers.
