Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the December 12, 2024, airstrike by the Israeli Air Force on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza, resulting in at least 33 deaths and 50 injuries.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/): 
Content: The Amnesty International report published in December 2024, concludes that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report documents Israeli actions between October 7, 2023, and early July 2024, including air strikes that killed at least 334 civilians, including 141 children. The report includes an image <image:3682> of Palestinians fleeing Gaza. The image is credited to Mahmoud Issa/Anadolu via Getty Images.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9g4yl8j17o): 
Content: The BBC News published an article on December 23, 2024, reporting on Israeli strikes in Gaza, which resulted in the deaths of at least 28 people, including children. <image:3684> The article mentions attacks on a school sheltering displaced families and the condemnation of the attacks by Pope Francis.

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image, credited to Anadolu, depicts Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, not the U.S. bombarding Yemen. Evidence from a reverse image search and web searches, including sources like the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/pg/photo-gallery/israeli-airstrikes-on-gaza-strip-)), confirms the image's origin and context.

So, the overall veracity is: false
