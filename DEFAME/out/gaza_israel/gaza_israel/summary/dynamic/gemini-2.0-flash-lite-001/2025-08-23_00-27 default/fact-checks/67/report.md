### Evidence from `web_search`
According to The Times of Israel, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Ankara, Turkey, on February 4, 2025. The article also mentions that Israel and Turkey held talks in Azerbaijan to prevent misunderstandings between their militaries operating in Syria. The article states that on April 3, 2025, there was an Israeli strike on a military airbase near Hama, Syria.

The Arab Weekly published on July 18, 2025, discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria.

The article also mentions that on February 4, 2025, Erdogan met with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in February 2025, Turkish President Erdogan met with Syria's interim President and criticized Israel's actions in Syria. However, the evidence does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The information about whether Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reported on March 16, 2025, that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, discussing the war between Russia and Ukraine and restoring stability in Syria, but did not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel (![image 4480](media/2025-08-23_01-00-1755910826-100881.jpg)). A Haaretz article from July 3, 2025, does not contain information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Erdogan discussed Syria with U.S. President Trump in March 2025. However, the provided sources do not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Turkish President Erdogan discussed Syria with the U.S. President in March 2025, but there is no evidence to support the claim that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Based on the evidence, while Turkish President Erdogan discussed Syria with the U.S. President in March 2025, there is no supporting evidence to confirm that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel regarding its intervention in Syria. The search results from Reuters and Haaretz ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/)) do not mention such a request.
