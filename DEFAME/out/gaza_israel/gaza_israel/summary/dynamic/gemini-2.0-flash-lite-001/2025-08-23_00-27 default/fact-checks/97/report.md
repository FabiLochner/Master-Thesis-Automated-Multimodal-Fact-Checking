## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The War on the Rocks published an article on August 8, 2024, discussing the possibility of a draft in the U.S., mentioning that conscription is being discussed among U.S. allies and adversaries. It also mentions recent proposals to automate Selective Service System registration and expand it to include all Americans, which has led to public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing. (<image:k>) Military.com states that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. Any attempt to bring back the draft would require legislation passed by Congress and signed by the president.

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that there were discussions about the possibility of a draft in the U.S. in August 2024, but there were no plans to reactivate it. The evidence also mentions a draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war in June 2025.

The claim that the U.S. reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is not supported by the evidence. While there were discussions and rumors, there is no evidence of the draft being reinstituted.


## Final Judgement
The search results show discussions about the possibility of a draft in the U.S. in August 2024, but no plans to reactivate it. The evidence also mentions a draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war in June 2025.

The claim is demonstrably false as there is no evidence to support the claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. `false`
