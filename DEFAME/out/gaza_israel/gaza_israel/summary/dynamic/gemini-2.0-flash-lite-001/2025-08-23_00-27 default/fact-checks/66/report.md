## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing munitions. According to Eurovision News | Spotlight, a video and still images falsely claimed that Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel. The video actually shows Zelenskyy at a U.S. munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces. The video was published in September 2024, and Zelenskyy's handwritten messages on the shells reference Ukraine's war with Russia, not Israel's war in Gaza.

Fox News reports that Zelenskyy signed a missile alongside Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Caliber.Az reports that Zelenskyy signed munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in Pennsylvania and inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” The event stirred controversy. ![image 40](media/66.jpg)
