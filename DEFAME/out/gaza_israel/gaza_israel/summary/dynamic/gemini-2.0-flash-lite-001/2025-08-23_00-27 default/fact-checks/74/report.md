## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, the evidence does not mention anything about Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack. The reports explicitly state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and that there were no injuries.

Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.

The claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm a drone attack on Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, but make no mention of Yair Netanyahu being killed. The reports state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and that there were no injuries.

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided evidence contradicts the assertion that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, as reported by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl4e7w2e7o) and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/drone-strike-launched-lebanon-netanyahus-house-no-casualities-reported-rcna176215), there were no injuries, and the reports do not mention Yair Netanyahu being killed.
