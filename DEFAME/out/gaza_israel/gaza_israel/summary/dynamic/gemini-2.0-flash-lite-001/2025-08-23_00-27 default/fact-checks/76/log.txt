Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-235600604.html): 
Content: The search result from Yahoo News, published in mid-October 2023, fact-checks a claim about a Facebook post attributed to Mel Gibson. The post, which includes an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass, claims Gibson said Israel's time was running out and that's why they're destroying everything in the way. The fact-check rates the post as "Fake" <image:4516> and states that Gibson has no public-facing social media accounts. The article also mentions that the independent Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar debunked the same fake Gibson post. <image:4517>, <image:4515>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53162246): 
Content: The BBC News article from June 24, 2020, discusses a dispute between Mel Gibson and Winona Ryder, where Ryder claims Gibson made anti-Semitic comments to her. <image:4527>, <image:4529>. The article mentions that Gibson has been accused of using the offensive term "oven dodger" and made widely documented anti-Semitic comments in 2006.

The claim '<image:47> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic social media post from Mel Gibson saying that Israel will end soon and therefore destroy everything in its way together with a flag in the color of Israel that shows an hourglass.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Fact-checkers from the Associated Press and Yahoo News have debunked the Facebook post attributed to Mel Gibson, finding it to be fake. They confirmed that Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.

So, the overall veracity is: false
