## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 6](media/5.jpg)) of an Israeli helicopter shooting flares was found in multiple sources. One source, from The Times of Israel, states that the image was taken during fighting in Gaza in May 2019 and that a Palestinian Islamic Jihad cell attempted to down an Israeli military helicopter. Another source, PesaCheck, states that the image is not of an Israeli helicopter shot down in southern Lebanon. Arab News PK published an article on March 26, 2019, stating that the image was taken on March 25, 2019, during Israeli airstrikes on Hamas targets in Gaza.

The sources are: [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-tried-to-down-an-idf-helicopter-during-fighting-this-month-report/), [PesaCheck](https://pesacheck.org/archive/2024/12/03), and [Arab News PK](https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1472406/middle-east).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts an Israeli helicopter deploying flares, not being shot down. The image was taken in Gaza in May 2019, not in Southern Lebanon in November 2024.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The image is from 2019 and shows an Israeli helicopter deploying flares in Gaza, not being shot down in Lebanon in 2024. `false`
