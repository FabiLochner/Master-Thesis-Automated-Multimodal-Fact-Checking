## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Mahmoud_Khalil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Mahmoud_Khalil)), Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and lawful permanent U.S. resident, was arrested and detained by ICE agents on March 8, 2025. The ACLU ([https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil)) also reported the arrest in March 2025, with Khalil's legal team claiming the arrest was unconstitutional.

CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/world/mahmoud-khalil-ice-detention-amanpour-interview-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/world/mahmoud-khalil-ice-detention-amanpour-interview-intl-hnk)) published an article on July 11, 2025, discussing the ICE detention of Mahmoud Khalil ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 2](media/1.jpg), ![image 3](media/2.jpg). The article mentions protests against his arrest, his claims of poor treatment in detention, and a claim filed by his lawyers against the Trump administration. It also mentions that Khalil was denied permission to be present at his son's birth.


### Evidence from `web_search`
A BBC News article from June 20, 2025, discusses the arrest and detention of Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil by U.S. immigration agents. The arrest was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators. Khalil was arrested in 2024 and held for three months before a judge ruled he must be released. The article mentions that Khalil moved to the US in 2022 and earned a master's degree at Columbia University.

## Elaboration
The claim is supported by the evidence. Multiple sources, including Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Mahmoud_Khalil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Mahmoud_Khalil)), the ACLU ([https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/us/mahmoud-khalil-detention-ice-court](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/us/mahmoud-khalil-detention-ice-court)) confirm that Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and lawful permanent U.S. resident, was arrested and detained by ICE agents. The arrest occurred in March 2025, as stated in the claim.

The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo)) mentions that Khalil was arrested in 2024 and held for three months before being released. This contradicts the claim that the arrest happened in March 2025. However, other sources support the March 2025 arrest date.

The evidence suggests that the claim is mostly accurate, but there is a discrepancy regarding the exact date of the arrest.


## Final Judgement
The claim is supported by multiple sources, including Wikipedia, the ACLU, and CNN, which confirm that Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and detained by ICE agents. The arrest date is consistently reported as March 2025. However, a BBC News article mentions an arrest in 2024.
