### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published a live coverage on July 7-8, 2025, about Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting at the White House, amid indirect talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. The article also mentions that Trump called Musk's new political party 'ridiculous'.

France 24 published an article on February 5, 2025, stating that an AI-generated photo of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Benjamin Netanyahu (![image 16](media/19.jpg)) is circulating on social media. The article debunks the claim that the image is authentic. An NDTV article, published on January 2, 2025, discusses Elon Musk's praise for Donald Trump's negotiation skills regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.
