The claim '<image:1> This image shows General John Pagri, Commander of the Special Tasks Battalion in the U.S. Army, which has died in the Gaza Strip in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of two soldiers in Iraq in 2007, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Two_19th_Group_Special_Forces_Soldiers_in_Babil_Province_Iraq.jpg)). The uniform in the photo was retired in 2019, and there is no record of a US Army General named John Pagri. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
