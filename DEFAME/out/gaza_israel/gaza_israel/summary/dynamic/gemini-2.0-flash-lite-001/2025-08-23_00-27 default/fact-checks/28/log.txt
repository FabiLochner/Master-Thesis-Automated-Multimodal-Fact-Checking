The claim 'Ethiopia has expelled Israel's ambassador in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was removed from an African Union meeting in April 2025, as reported by [Tasnim News Agency](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/), and [JNS](https://www.jns.org/israeli-envoy-ejected-from-african-union-event-on-rwandan-genocide/), the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.

So, the overall veracity is: false
