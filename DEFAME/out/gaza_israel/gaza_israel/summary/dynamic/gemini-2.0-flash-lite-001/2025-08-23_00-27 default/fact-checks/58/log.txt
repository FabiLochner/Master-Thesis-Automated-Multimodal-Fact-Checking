Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Gaza_war): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Timeline of the Gaza war" provides a timeline of events from October 7, 2023, to August 2025. It includes sections on the initial attacks, the invasion of the Gaza Strip, ceasefires, and various military engagements and attacks. The article also lists casualties and reactions to the war. The article was retrieved on February 26, 2025. The article mentions the "May 2025 Gaza offensive" and the "August 2025 Gaza offensive".

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-the-gaza-strip-in-modern-history): 
Content: The PBS article, published on February 5, 2025, provides a timeline of the Gaza Strip in modern history. It mentions the destruction in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on October. The article includes an image of destruction in Gaza <image:4236>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.oxfam.org/en/timeline-humanitarian-impact-gaza-blockade): 
Content: The Oxfam timeline details the humanitarian impact of the Gaza blockade, mentioning events from 2007 to 2018. The timeline includes images of destruction and mentions the impact of the blockade on the economy and the lives of Palestinians.

The claim '<image:33> This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the evidence confirms significant destruction in Gaza, with nearly 80-92% of buildings damaged or destroyed by July 2025, the image's date and location are not verified. The geolocation suggests the image was most likely taken in Jordan.

So, the overall veracity is: false
