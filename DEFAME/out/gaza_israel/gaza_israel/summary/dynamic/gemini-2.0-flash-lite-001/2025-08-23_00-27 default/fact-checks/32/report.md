## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The AOL fact-check, published on December 12, 2024, states that the claim that Israeli General Tomer Bar was killed by Hezbollah in a drone strike is false, and there are no media reports confirming Bar's death (![image 3825](media/2025-08-23_00-37-1755909433-429696.jpg)). Inshorts reports that Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed by Hezbollah in a November drone attack on his Tel Aviv residence. The article was published on December 9, 2024, by Disha Jana (![image 3852](media/2025-08-23_00-37-1755909446-318723.jpg), ![image 3853](media/2025-08-23_00-37-1755909446-914662.jpg)).

CUFI.org discusses a drone strike and mentions Air Force Commander Major General Tomer Bar (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The article states that Major General Tomer Bar ordered the elimination of Hezbollah’s UAV unit. The article was published in October 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results provide information about Tomer Bar, the current Commander of the Israeli Air Force, who assumed office on April 4, 2022 (<image:k>). The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/tags/tomer-bar](https://www.jpost.com/tags/tomer-bar)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/tomer-bar/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/tomer-bar/)) have published articles mentioning Tomer Bar. The Times of Israel published an article from June 28, 2024, where Tomer Bar said the IDF is ready to face Hezbollah, and another article from December 10, 2024, discusses a drone that hit a building in Yavne. An article from August 12, 2025, mentions Tomer Bar saying he will not allow political polarization to split troops under his command (<image:i>).


## Elaboration
The claim is false. Fact-checks from AOL and Inshorts confirm that Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed in a drone attack. Additionally, CUFI.org mentions Tomer Bar in the context of a drone strike, but not as a victim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple sources, including fact-checks from AOL and Inshorts, confirms that the claim is false. These sources state that Tomer Bar is alive and was not killed in a drone attack.

`false`
