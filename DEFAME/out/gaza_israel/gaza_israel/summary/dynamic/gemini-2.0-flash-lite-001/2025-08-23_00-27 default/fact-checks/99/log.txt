Useful result: From [Source](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/union-city-dog-attack-donna-nguyen): 
Content: The search result from FOX 5 Atlanta reports on a 62-year-old woman, Donna Nguyen, who died after a dog attack. The article includes an image of the woman in the hospital <image:4847>. The attack occurred in Union City, Georgia, and the family is seeking accountability. The article was published on August 17, 2023.

The claim '<image:65> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are documented instances of Israeli army dogs attacking Palestinian women, the image in the claim is a digitally created artwork, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it depicts an authentic event. Reverse image searches and web searches did not provide any information to verify the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
