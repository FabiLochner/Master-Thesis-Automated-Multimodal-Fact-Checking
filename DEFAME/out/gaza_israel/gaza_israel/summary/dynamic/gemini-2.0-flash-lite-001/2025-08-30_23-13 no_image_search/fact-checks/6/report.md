### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 10202](media/6.jpg)) has been identified as potentially fake and AI-generated, according to PesaCheck ([https://pesacheck.org/fake-this-image-claiming-to-show-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-admitted-in-hospital-isnt-24197dac209e](https://pesacheck.org/fake-this-image-claiming-to-show-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-admitted-in-hospital-isnt-24197dac209e)).

### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from Buffalo.edu, published on November 20, 2024, discusses an AI-generated image falsely claiming Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized, and mentions AFP Fact Check debunking the image. ([https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html](https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/news-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/ai-generated-image-used-to-falsely-claim-netanyahu-hospitalized.detail.html))

CNN reports that Benjamin Netanyahu left a Jerusalem hospital on December 31, 2024, after prostate removal surgery. ![image 10202](media/6.jpg) is not present in the search result. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/netanyahu-hospital-prostate-budget-bill-intl-latam](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/31/middleeast/netanyahu-hospital-prostate-budget-bill-intl-latam))


## Elaboration
The image is likely fake or AI-generated, as indicated by PesaCheck and the University at Buffalo. The image was used to falsely claim Netanyahu was hospitalized in November 2024.

While Netanyahu did undergo prostate surgery in December 2024, the CNN report does not include the image.


## Final Judgement
The image is likely fake or AI-generated, and was used to falsely claim Benjamin Netanyahu was hospitalized in November 2024. While Netanyahu did undergo prostate surgery in December 2024, the provided image is not associated with that event in reliable sources.
