Content: The Haaretz article, published on August 7, 2025, reports that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was photographed next to graffiti reading "Death to Arabs" during a visit to an Israeli settlement in the northern West Bank.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-photographed-next-to-death-to-arabs-graffiti-disavows-message/): 
Content: The Times of Israel published an article on August 7, 2025, about Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich being photographed near the phrase "Death to Arabs" during a tour of the northern West Bank. <image:12231>, <image:12232>. The article mentions Smotrich's visit to the former settlement of Sa-Nur.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/bezalel-smotrich): 
Content: The search result from Getty Images contains several photographs of Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The images show Smotrich at various events, including a Jerusalem Day Flag March on June 5, 2024, a party meeting on February 5, 2024, and a visit to the Knesset. <image:12241>, <image:12242>, <image:12243>, <image:12244>, <image:12245>, <image:12246>, <image:12251>, <image:12252>, <image:12257>, <image:12258>. The images do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim.

The claim '<image:10246> This image shows Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich, who previously threatened to invade Lebanon, taking shelter in an Israeli bomb shelter during Hezbollah's attack on Israel on August 25, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich was present at other events, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image shows Smotrich in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on that date ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-launches-airstrikes-inside-lebanon-hezbollah-targets/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
