```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10228](media/58.jpg) was found on two websites: Apartments.com ([https://www.apartments.com/near-me/apartments-for-rent/11/](https://www.apartments.com/near-me/apartments-for-rent/11/)) and a website titled "Apartments For Rent In Hometown, Illinois" ([https://www.setrents.com/Hometown/Apartment](https://www.setrents.com/Hometown/Apartment)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
An Al Jazeera article from August 24, 2025, reports that Israel has destroyed over 1,000 buildings in Gaza City.

The UN article also discusses the challenges in removing debris and recovering bodies. The image ![image 10228](media/58.jpg)

## Elaboration
The reverse image search results are not relevant to the claim. However, the web search results provide information about the destruction in Gaza.

The Al Jazeera article from August 2025 and the UN News report from April 2025 confirm significant destruction in Gaza. The UN article states that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed.

## Final Judgement
The image search results are not relevant. However, the web search results confirm significant destruction in Gaza. The UN article states that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed. The claim that Gaza is completely destroyed is plausible, given the extent of damage reported in 2025.
