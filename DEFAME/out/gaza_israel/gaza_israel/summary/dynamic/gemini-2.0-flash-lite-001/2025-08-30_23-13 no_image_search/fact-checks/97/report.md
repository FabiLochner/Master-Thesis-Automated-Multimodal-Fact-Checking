## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php)) discusses a draft resolution on the war in Gaza, with the US expected to vote on it. The UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164056](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/06/1164056)) reports on a US veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire.

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Israel_in_the_Gaza_war)) details US support for Israel, including military aid and vetoes of ceasefire resolutions. The provided sources do not mention the US reinstituting the draft. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. The search results focus on the US's involvement in the Israel-Hamas war through diplomatic actions and military aid, but they do not mention the reinstitution of the draft.

The Security Council Report and UN News articles discuss the US's role in the conflict, including voting on resolutions. Wikipedia provides information on US support for Israel. None of these sources mention a draft.

To verify the claim, information about a potential draft would be needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on conscription in the United States ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)) discusses the history of the draft, including its use in past wars and the end of the draft in 1973. It also mentions the possibility of future drafts.

An article published on War on the Rocks on August 8, 2024, titled "Preparing for the Possibility of a Draft Without Panic" ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)) discusses the possibility of a draft in the US. <image:k>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The PBS NewsHour article ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-israel-is-responding-to-latest-u-s-proposals-to-pause-war-in-gaza](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-israel-is-responding-to-latest-u-s-proposals-to-pause-war-in-gaza)) discusses a U.S. proposal for a cease-fire in Gaza. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4p9rg8zlo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr4p9rg8zlo)) reports on a US veto of a UN Security Council resolution demanding a ceasefire. Neither article mentions the US reinstituting the draft. ![image 12565](media/2025-08-31_00-29-1756600158-918504.jpg) ![image 12566](media/2025-08-31_00-29-1756600160-928500.jpg) ![image 12569](media/2025-08-31_00-29-1756600164-641159.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the "War on the Rocks" article ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)) discusses the possibility of a draft, it does not confirm that the draft has been reinstituted. The other sources focus on US involvement in the Israel-Hamas war through diplomatic actions and do not mention a draft.


## Final Judgement
The search results do not provide any evidence that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While some sources discuss the possibility of a draft, none confirm that it has been reinstituted.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, the provided evidence, including articles from the Security Council Report, UN News, Wikipedia, and War on the Rocks ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)), does not confirm that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.
