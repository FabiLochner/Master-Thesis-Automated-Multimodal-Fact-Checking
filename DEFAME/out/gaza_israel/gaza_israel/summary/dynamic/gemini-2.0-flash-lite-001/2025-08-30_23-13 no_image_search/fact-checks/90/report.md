## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Redouane Messaoud Dris, an Algerian judoka, was disqualified from the Olympics after failing to weigh-in before his match against Israel's Tohar Butbul, according to the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo)) ![image 12291](media/2025-08-31_00-18-1756599487-029339.jpg). ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) ![image 12295](media/2025-08-31_00-18-1756599489-770151.jpg) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) <image:i> also reported on the incident, with the IJF investigating the situation.

The incident marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul in the past two Olympics.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Redouane Messaoud Dris, an Algerian judoka, was disqualified from the Olympics after failing to weigh-in before his match against Israel's Tohar Butbul. The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo)), ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) all reported on the incident.

The evidence supports the claim that an Algerian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent. However, the reason for the withdrawal was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that an Algerian judoka, Redouane Messaoud Dris, did not compete against an Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, at the Olympics. However, the reason was a failure to weigh-in, not a direct withdrawal.

`true`

### Verdict: TRUE

### Justification
Redouane Messaoud Dris, an Algerian judoka, did not compete against Israel's Tohar Butbul at the Olympics because he failed to weigh-in, as reported by the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cp68x1xp05eo)), ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)), and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)).
