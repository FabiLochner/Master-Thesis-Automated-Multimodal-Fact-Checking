Useful result: From [Source](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel): Found exact image on website with title: FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

The release includes the image <image:1348> which is the same as the image in the claim. The release is a statement condemning the attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists.

Useful result: From [Source](https://turdef.com/country/israel-news?page=5): Found exact image on website with title: Israel Defence News - TURDEF
Content: The search result from TURDEF contains an image that matches the claim <image:10253> and is titled "Second Yom Kippur War in Israel" with a release date of October 7, 2023. <image:1356>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-daily-edition/2023-10-07/): Found exact image on website with title: The Daily Edition | The Times of Israel
Content: The Times of Israel published an article on October 7, 2023, detailing the Hamas attack on Israel. The article includes images of the aftermath of rocket attacks and the damage caused. <image:10253> is not mentioned in the article. The article also mentions that rockets were fired at Tel Aviv.

The claim '<image:10253> This image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim was published in October 2023, and is related to the Hamas attack on Israel, not a Houthi attack in July 2024. The reverse image search results show the image was used in news articles from October 2023, such as the one from the [Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel).

So, the overall veracity is: false
