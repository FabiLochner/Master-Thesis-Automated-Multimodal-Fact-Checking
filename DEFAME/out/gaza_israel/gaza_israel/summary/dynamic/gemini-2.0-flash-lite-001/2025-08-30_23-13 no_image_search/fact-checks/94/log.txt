Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/newborn-baby-dies-c-section-gaza-rafah-airstrike-1.7185400): 
Content: The CBC News article, published on April 25, 2024, reports on the death of a baby girl in Gaza who was delivered via emergency C-section after her mother was killed in an Israeli airstrike.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68369336): 
Content: The BBC article, published on February 22, 2024, discusses the evacuation of injured Palestinian children from Gaza. The article includes images of the evacuation process, including children on a plane and being carried by aid workers. <image:12460>, <image:12462>, <image:12465>.

The claim '<image:10256> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches reveal that the image was taken in Douma, Syria, in 2018, and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask, as reported by sources like The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/russia-backed-network-of-syria-conspiracy-theorists-identified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/russia-backed-network-of-syria-conspiracy-theorists-identified)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
