Content: The Suburban published an article about a legal action against Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante regarding pro-Palestinian electronic signs. The signs, which displayed messages like "Free Palestine. Escalate now" and "Globalize the Intifada," were criticized for promoting hate and violence. The legal action was initiated by Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi, who contends that Plante's negligence enabled the spread of hate. The article includes an image of one of the signs <image:10622> and mentions that Montreal is denying responsibility, stating the signs belong to a private contractor. The article also mentions that the police are investigating the incident.

Content: The article from The Maple, published on September 5, 2024, discusses the City of Montreal's removal of pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election. The signs were put up by LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), a registered third-party campaign group. The article mentions that this is not the first time the city has removed pro-Palestine signs, and that the city is facing legal action. The article also mentions that Jeremy Levi, the mayor of Hampstead, called the signs "hate propaganda." <image:10208> is not mentioned in the article.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-812229): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article on July 28, 2024, about Montreal electronic street signs displaying a message. The article mentions Hampstead Mayor Levi demanding an apology from Montreal. <image:1>.

The claim '<image:10208> This image shows a traffic sign in Montreal in July 2024 which displays a 'Free Palestine. Escalate now' message and was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." However, the sign was the result of a hack, and the City of Montreal considered it an act of vandalism, as reported by [CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/montreal/article/montreal-electronic-traffic-signs-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian-political-slogans/), [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809), and [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-montreal-traffic-signs-apparently-hacked-to-display-pro-palestinian/). Therefore, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
