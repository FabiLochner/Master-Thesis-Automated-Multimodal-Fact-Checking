Content: Reuters reports that the U.S. military conducted an airstrike on December 16, 2024, against a Houthi command and control facility in Yemen. The article mentions that the Houthis have been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

The claim '<image:10200> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is from 2018 and shows the destruction of Al-Aqsa TV headquarters in Gaza, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%89-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9/1309486)). While the U.S. did conduct airstrikes in Yemen on December 22, 2024, the image does not depict this event.

So, the overall veracity is: false
