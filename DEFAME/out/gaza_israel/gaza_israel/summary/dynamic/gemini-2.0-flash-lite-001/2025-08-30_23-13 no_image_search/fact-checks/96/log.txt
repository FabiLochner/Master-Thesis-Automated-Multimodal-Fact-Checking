The claim '<image:10258> This image shows Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) who were killed by Israel along with their mother and grandmother at Al-Jaoni UN school in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on July, 6 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school, as reported by [countercurrents.org](https://countercurrents.org/2024/07/israel-bombs-un-school-in-nuseirat/). However, the claim that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
