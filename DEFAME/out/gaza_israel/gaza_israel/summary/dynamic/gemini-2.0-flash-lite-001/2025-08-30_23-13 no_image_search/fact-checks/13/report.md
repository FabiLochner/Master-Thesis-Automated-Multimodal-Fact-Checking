## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 10206](media/13.jpg) appears in multiple contexts. One source, [Serateshgh.com](https://serateshgh.com/international/massive-explosion-reported-in-kandahar-mosque/), uses the image to report a massive explosion in Kandahar's grand mosque.
