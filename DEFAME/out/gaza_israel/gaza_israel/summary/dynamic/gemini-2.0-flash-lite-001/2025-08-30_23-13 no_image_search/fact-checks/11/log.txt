Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-attack-10-14-24-intl-hnk): 
Content: CNN reports on October 15, 2024, about a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli army base on October 13, 2024, which killed four Israeli soldiers and injured more than 60. <image:k>. The article does not mention the assassination of Herzi Halevi.

The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, which resulted in casualties, reports from sources like The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/)) indicate that Herzi Halevi was not assassinated and, in fact, visited the site the following day.

So, the overall veracity is: false
