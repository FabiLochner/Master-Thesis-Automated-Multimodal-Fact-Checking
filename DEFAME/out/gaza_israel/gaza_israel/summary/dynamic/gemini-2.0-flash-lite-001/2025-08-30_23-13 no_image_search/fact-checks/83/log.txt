Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/spanish/noticias-del-mundo/article-837650): Found exact image on website with title: FC Barcelona envía un mensaje de apoyo a Israel
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article on January 15, 2025, about FC Barcelona sending a message of support to Israel. The article includes the image <image:10247> and states that Israeli diplomats presented the FC Barcelona president with an Israeli flag on February 16, 2023.

The claim '<image:10247> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts FC Barcelona's president with Israeli embassy representatives, taken on February 16, 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/spanish/noticias-del-mundo/article-837650) and Ynet. This predates the Gaza war, which began on October 7, 2023, making the claim's date inaccurate.

So, the overall veracity is: false
