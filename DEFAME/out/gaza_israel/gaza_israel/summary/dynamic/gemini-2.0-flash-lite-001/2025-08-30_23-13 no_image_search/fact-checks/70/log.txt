Useful result: From [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets): 
Content: NPR reported on October 2, 2024, that the Iranian missile strike on Israel appeared to have hit some targets, and that the attack was more sophisticated than the one in April. <image:11981>, <image:11967>, <image:11980>. The article mentions that the Iron Dome is used to intercept incoming missiles. The article also mentions that the Arrow missile defense system is also used, but has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome. The article does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf): 
Content: The Washington Institute published an article on October 11, 2024, discussing the October 1 Iranian attack on Israel. The article states that Iran fired around 200 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) at Israel. It also mentions that "most of the missiles were destroyed before reaching their target, some did impact and cause minimal damage." The article estimates that around three-quarters of the missiles were intercepted, primarily by Israeli air defenses, with help from the U.S. <image:i>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next): 
Content: Al Jazeera reports that Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, firing a barrage of missiles. <image:i>. The article states that the US and Israel worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles fired by Iran. The Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The IRGC claimed that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets. The article was published on October 1, 2024, by Al Jazeera Staff.

The claim 'The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While some sources suggest a high interception rate, the evidence indicates conflicting information. The Washington Institute estimates around three-quarters of the missiles were intercepted, and Al Jazeera reports that the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the missiles, while the IRGC claimed 90 percent of the projectiles hit their targets. ([https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/israels-missile-defense-performance-views-gulf), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)).
