Wikimedia Commons credits a blog post from the US National Guard as the source of the image. While the site has since been deleted, an archived version available via the Internet Archive says that the men in the image are two sergeants named Robbie Doman and Christopher W. Sullenberger. Doman, standing in the middle of the photograph, received media coverage in 2017 when he appeared on the NBC television show ""American Ninja Warrior"" after being injured in an explosion in 2008 (archived here, and here). Several US media outlets published images of Doman from his service in Iraq, which are similar to those used in the social media posts (archived here)."

","However, November 2024 social media posts claiming he was hospitalized with a ""serious health issue"" are false; the Israeli leader gave a speech to lawmakers when he was supposedly admitted, and experts told AFP the image shared online is likely AI-generated. The photo being shared of Netanyahu was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said. Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California-Berkeley (archived here), said he analyzed the image using three models trained to identify pictures created using artificial intelligence, all of which classified it as ""likely"" being AI-generated. He told AFP on November 19 that he compared the image with actual photographs of Netanyahu and found the left ear was different from that of the Israeli prime minister, indicating it is ""not authentic."" Siwei Lyu, director of the State University of New York at Buffalo's Media Forensic Lab (archived here), also ran the image through a program designed to detect deepfake images and found it is likely not authentic.

On the contrary, the latest travel by Netanyahu that could be found on news outlets was before the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27. The Israeli prime minister traveled to New York to trick Nasrallah into thinking that he was safe, as reported by The Telegraph. Furthermore, Netanyahu published a video on his X account on Wednesday at 12:52 a.m. Israel time, only a few hours after the Iranian missile attack. In the video, the Israeli prime minister was at the Security Cabinet giving a speech on the attack, thanking the U.S. and warning Iran that it made a big mistake, which further confirms that he did not leave Israel for Poland.

97,The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.,False,False,True,"The claim is false. While there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, the provided evidence, including articles from the Security Council Report, UN News, Wikipedia, and War on the Rocks ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)), does not confirm that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.
"," The U.S. is not conscripting Americans into the military for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The video references a bill passed by the House that would automatically register 18- to 25-year-old men for the selective service, but the bill isn't law and doesn't automatically induct individuals into the armed forces. To reinstate a draft, Congress and the president would be required to act. There is no evidence the U.S. has begun forcing Americans to enlist in the military to fight in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The website for the Selective Service System – the federal agency that registers men and maintains a system for a potential draft – says there is currently no draft."
98,<image:10259> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel.,False,False,True,"The image in the claim is used as cover art for a song and is not an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson wearing the Israeli flag. While Dwayne Johnson has shown support for Israel, the image is not authentic, as confirmed by a reverse image search ([Source](https://music.apple.com/us/song/jewish-rock/1406634253)) and fact-check articles ([Myth Detector](https://mythdetector.com/en/dwayne-johnson-about-israel/) and [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fact-check-fake-dwayne-johnson-234700368.html)).
"," A close look at the image showed several discrepancies that indicated it could be generated via artificial intelligence. Johnson's left eye is misaligned with his right. His hand holding the placard is unusually large and distorted, and he appears to be holding the placard awkwardly. We also noticed a very different tattoo on his right arm in the viral image, which does not match his original tattoo, as seen on his official Instagram account (archived here). In reality, Dwayne Johnson has a tattoo resembling an animal skull — he had shared an image of him getting the tattoo in 2021 (archived here), saying that it was a ""bull tattoo."" This tattoo can also be seen on his right arm in a recent video (archived here) he posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on July 1, 2024. Hive Moderation, an online AI detection tool, found this image to be 70.8 percent likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content. "
99,<image:10260> This is an authentic image of an elderly Palestinian women being attacked by an Israeli army dog in June 2024.,True,False,False,"The image depicts an attack by an Israeli police dog on an elderly Palestinian woman, as reported by [Morocco World News](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2024/06/18005/israeli-police-dog-attack-on-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outrage/) and other sources, confirming the claim's authenticity. The incident occurred in June 2024 in the Jabalia refugee camp.
"," NewsMeter found that claim is misleading. The incident did occur but the image is AI-generated. Upon examination, the angle and the graphical aesthetics of the photo suggested that the photo might be AI-generated. Further inspection of the image revealed a watermark - IN.VISUALART - indicating its origin. The ‘Ps+ Ai’ notation signified that the image was created using Artificial Intelligence. A keyword search led to an Instagram post from six days ago, where the same photo was shared with a caption stating, “Al-Jazeera obtained leaked footage from a camera mounted by occupation soldiers on a police dog showing the dog attacking an elderly Palestinian woman in her home during an operation the occupation army was about to carry out in Jebalia camp weeks ago. Stop genocide - Ceasefire now- Save Gaza- free Palestine.” A follow-up video on the same channel, with the caption “Video shows Israeli military dog mauling elderly Palestinian woman amid army operation in Jabalia,” featured the elderly woman speaking about the attack. Different news outlets, including the Palestine Chronicle, reported the incident with the title “‘Israelis Set a Dog on Me’ – Video Shows Army Unleashing Dog on Elderly Palestinian Woman.” Hence, the claim is misleading. Although the incident did occur, the viral photo was created using Artificial Intelligence. There are clues in the image that is the focus of this fact check that the picture is not real -- the men's fingers appear abnormally elongated, and the ball of fire behind the Israeli flag appears to be in the sky beside the two World Trade Center towers. Lead Stories also ran the video through True Media, an AI-detection tool, which found substantial evidence that it was created using AI."
