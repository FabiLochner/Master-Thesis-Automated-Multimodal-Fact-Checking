### Evidence from `web_search`
The Special Troops Battalion (STB) provides command, readiness, and legal support to assigned and attached units and supports community relations and outreach in the Kansas and Missouri area (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) website provides information about the TRADOC Special Troops Battalion, including its mission, functions, and contact information (![image 10316](media/2025-08-30_23-15-1756595713-188307.jpg)). The United States Army Special Forces (SF), also known as the "Green Berets," is a branch of the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC).

The core missions of the Special Forces include unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, direct action, counterterrorism, and special reconnaissance.


## Elaboration
The search results did not provide any information about a General John Pagri. The image search did not provide any information about the image. The search results mention the Special Troops Battalion, but there is no mention of a commander named John Pagri.

Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. There is no information to support the existence of General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip.

Content: The search result from Yahoo News states that the image ![image 10196](media/0.jpg)

## Elaboration
The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Peru, Pakistan, Tunisia, or the United States. The Yahoo News search result indicates that the image is of a U.S. Army general. However, the search results do not mention a General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The initial search results did not provide any information about a General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip. The image search did not provide any information about the image. The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Peru, Pakistan, Tunisia, or the United States. The Yahoo News search result indicates that the image is of a U.S. Army general. However, the search results do not mention a General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip.

The claim is demonstrably false because there is no evidence to support the existence of General John Pagri or his death in the Gaza Strip. The image is of a U.S. Army general, but not the one mentioned in the claim. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
