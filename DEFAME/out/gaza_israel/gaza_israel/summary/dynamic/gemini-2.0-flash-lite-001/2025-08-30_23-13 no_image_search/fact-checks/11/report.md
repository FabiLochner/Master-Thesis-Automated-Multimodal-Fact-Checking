## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) reported on false rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death in a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024, which left over 60 people wounded ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/)) reported on a Hezbollah drone attack on a Golani base on October 13, 2024, which killed four soldiers ![image 10562](media/2025-08-30_23-23-1756596224-075402.jpg), ![image 10563](media/2025-08-30_23-23-1756596224-508940.jpg), ![image 10564](media/2025-08-30_23-23-1756596224-817371.jpg), ![image 10561](media/2025-08-30_23-23-1756596223-653646.jpg). Herzi Halevi visited the site on October 14, 2024, and praised the troops ![image 10565](media/2025-08-30_23-23-1756596225-113258.jpg).

CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-attack-10-14-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-attack-10-14-24-intl-hnk)) reported on October 15, 2024, about a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli army base on October 13, 2024, which killed four Israeli soldiers and injured more than 60 <image:k>. The article does not mention the assassination of Herzi Halevi.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) reported on false rumors of Herzi Halevi's death. Furthermore, Herzi Halevi visited the site of the drone attack on October 14, 2024, which contradicts the claim of his assassination on October 13, 2024.


## Final Judgement
The evidence from multiple reliable sources, including The Jerusalem Post, The Times of Israel, and CNN, contradicts the claim. These sources report on a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, but they do not mention the assassination of Herzi Halevi. In fact, Herzi Halevi was reported to have visited the site the following day.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While there was a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024, which resulted in casualties, reports from sources like The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) and The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/)) indicate that Herzi Halevi was not assassinated and, in fact, visited the site the following day.
