Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next): 
Content: Al Jazeera reported on October 1, 2024, that Iran launched a missile attack against Israel in response to Israeli attacks. <image:1> The article mentions that alarms sounded in Israel, and the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The US and Israel worked together to shoot down most of the projectiles. The article also includes reactions from world leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Iran "made a big mistake" and "will pay for it."

The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as confirmed by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence that Netanyahu fled to Poland. Although Poland later offered Netanyahu protection due to an ICC arrest warrant, this was unrelated to the missile attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
