## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article on October 6, 2024, discussing Keir Starmer's call for unity and a ceasefire in the Middle East, mentioning his comments on the anniversary of the October 7 attacks, his support for the Jewish community, and his call for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon. The article also mentions rallies and demonstrations (![image 10733](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596521-469226.jpg), ![image 10737](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596524-182196.jpg), ![image 10738](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596525-013798.jpg), ![image 10742](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596527-291221.jpg), ![image 10726](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596519-077969.jpg)). The BBC published an article on October 7, 2024, discussing Keir Starmer's reflections on the October 7 attacks on Israel (![image 10747](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596532-340324.jpg), ![image 10750](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596533-658217.jpg)).

Al Jazeera reported on September 24, 2024, that Keir Starmer called for de-escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and appealed for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not support the claim that Keir Starmer said in October 2024 that the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel. The evidence indicates that Starmer called for ceasefires and de-escalation, and expressed support for the Jewish community.

The articles from The Guardian, BBC, and Al Jazeera do not mention any statements by Starmer about boycotting diplomatic relations with Israel.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer made statements about the conflict in the Middle East, including calls for ceasefires and de-escalation. However, there is no mention of him stating that the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided evidence does not support it. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The search results from The Guardian, BBC, and Al Jazeera show that Keir Starmer made statements in October 2024 regarding the conflict in the Middle East, including calls for ceasefires and de-escalation, but there is no evidence to support the claim that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel. Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false.
