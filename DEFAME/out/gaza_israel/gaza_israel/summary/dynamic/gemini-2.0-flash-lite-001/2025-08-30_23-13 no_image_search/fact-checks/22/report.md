Content: The article from ABP Live fact-checks an image of Mike Tyson with a Palestinian flag, claiming it is fake and likely AI-generated. The article states that the image was not taken before his fight with Jake Paul on November 15, 2024. The article provides evidence of manipulation, including visual discrepancies in the image, such as the absence of Tyson's tattoo and incorrect flag design. ![image 10749](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596533-289316.jpg), ![image 10751](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596536-520341.jpg), ![image 10752](media/2025-08-30_23-28-1756596538-734239.jpg), ![image 10753](media/2025-08-30_23-29-1756596541-384990.jpg), ![image 10754](media/2025-08-30_23-29-1756596544-872861.jpg), ![image 10755](media/2025-08-30_23-29-1756596547-881362.jpg), ![image 10757](media/2025-08-30_23-29-1756596550-352283.jpg). The article also mentions that Tyson has not publicly taken a partisan stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The article was published on November 20, 2024.


## Elaboration

The image is a fake, as confirmed by multiple sources. The claim that it is an authentic image is therefore false. `false`
