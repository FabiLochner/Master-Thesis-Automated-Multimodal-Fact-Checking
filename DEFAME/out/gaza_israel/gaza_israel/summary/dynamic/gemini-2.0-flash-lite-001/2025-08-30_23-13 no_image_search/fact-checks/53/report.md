## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on July 25, 2024, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump's post on July 25, 2024, stated, "I hope that America obliterates Israel." Instead, one article mentions a post where Trump called for the annihilation of Iran. Another article mentions Trump welcoming Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago.

The evidence does mention an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, at a Trump rally. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote from the claim.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and that there was an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024. However, the search results do not contain the exact quote from the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the provided evidence does not support the specific quote attributed to Trump. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Donald Trump did post on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, and there was an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, the provided evidence, including reports from [Iran International](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407252585) and the [Indiana Capital Chronicle](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2024/07/25/in-capitol-address-israeli-leader-calls-for-u-s-backing-to-defeat-hamas/), does not support the specific quote attributed to Trump in the claim.
