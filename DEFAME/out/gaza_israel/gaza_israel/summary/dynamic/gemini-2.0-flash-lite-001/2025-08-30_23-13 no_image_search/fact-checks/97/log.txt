The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there are discussions about the possibility of a draft, the provided evidence, including articles from the Security Council Report, UN News, Wikipedia, and War on the Rocks ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)), does not confirm that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
