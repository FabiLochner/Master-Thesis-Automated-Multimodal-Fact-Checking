Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-67843832): 
Content: The BBC News article from December 29, 2023, reports on the Israel-Gaza war. The article mentions an Israeli air strike on Rafah, Gaza, where a baby girl was pulled alive from the rubble. The article also mentions that more than 21,500 people, mostly children and women, have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza. The article includes several images, but none of them match the image in the claim. <image:12347>, <image:12349>, <image:12353>, <image:12356>, <image:12359>, <image:12363>, <image:12365>, <image:12367>.

The claim '<image:10254> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is a stock photo of a Palestinian child in rubble, which aligns with the claim's description. While the image's context is related to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, the specific date of July 2024 cannot be verified. Therefore, the claim is plausible but lacks specific date verification.

So, the overall veracity is: false
