Useful result: From [Source](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/18/lebanon-exploding-pagers-harmed-hezbollah-civilians): 
Content: Human Rights Watch published an article on September 18, 2024, about exploding pagers in Lebanon on September 17, 2024, which resulted in at least 12 deaths and 2,800 injuries. <image:10226> is not present in the search result.

The claim '<image:10226> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there were attacks in Lebanon in September 2024, they involved explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, not iPhones. The image depicts an iPhone, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it exploded during the attacks.

So, the overall veracity is: false
