TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

Your Message Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

Questions and Answers: Israeli Military’s Use of Digital Tools in Gaza

[![A technologist with the Israeli military's Matzpen operational data and applications unit works at his station, at an Israel Defense Force base in Ramat Gan, Israel, June 11, 2023. The Israeli military reportedly uses surveillance technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital tools to help determine who or what to attack in Gaza and when.

Human Rights Watch found that four digital tools that the Israeli military is using in Gaza use faulty data and inexact approximations to inform military actions. Some tools rely on machine learning, which is the use of computerized systems that can draw inferences from data and recognize patterns without explicit instructions.

It has not been possible to document when and where these digital tools are being used or the extent to which these tools have been used in conjunction with other methods of information and intelligence collection. Based on reports, Israeli military officers are responsible for setting the threshold beyond which an individual can be marked as a target subject to attack.

The military has acknowledged the existence of a tool like Lavender [in very general terms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-defence-forces-response-to-claims-about-use-of-lavender-ai-database-in-gaza)
, calling it a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources.”

A presentation and book by two Israeli officers provide important technical details. **What is** “**Where’s Daddy?**” **and how does it work?**

Based on media reports, “Where’s Daddy” is a tool that uses mobile phone location tracking to notify Israeli military operators when people who have been marked as military targets enter a specific location – according to reports, often a family home – where they can be attacked. A mobile phone is not a reliable proxy for a human target, as people, especially in conflict zones, may change numbers or devices during an emergency where access to networks and devices may frequently and suddenly change.

In addition, the most common methods for tracking cell phone location are through [triangulating cell tower locations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221568410_Accuracy_Characterization_of_Cell_Tower_Localization)
, called cell site location information, or through gaining access to a [mobile phone's GPS data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638960/)

 in their operations in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military’s use of these digital tools risk Israeli forces violating international humanitarian law, in particular the laws of war concerning distinction between military targets and civilians, and the need to take all feasible precautions before an attack to minimize civilian harm.

Human Rights Watch research indicates that the tools apparently rely on ongoing and systematic Israeli surveillance of all Palestinian residents of Gaza, including with data collected prior to the current hostilities in a manner that is incompatible with international human rights law."

How Israeli intelligence tracked Iranian leaders in June strike? NYT reveals
============================================================================

30 August 2025 18:29

**Israel developed a new method for targeting key Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists during the 12-day conflict in June 2025.**

An analysis by The New York Times **[revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/us/politics/israel-iran-assassination.html)
** that Israeli intelligence tracked high-ranking Iranian officials by monitoring the cell phones of bodyguards accompanying them. This strategy went undetected by Iran’s security and intelligence agencies.

On June 16, Israeli military aircraft struck an underground bunker on a mountainside in Tehran during an emergency session of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Share it on social media!

!loading <image:12324> Present in the bunker were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the head of the judiciary, ministers of interior, defence, and intelligence, along with senior military commanders. While the leaders survived, several security personnel were killed in the explosions.

The attacks were part of a larger Israeli operation aimed at infiltrating the upper levels of the Iranian security apparatus. Intelligence experts also noted that the information the guards shared on social media inadvertently revealed the leaders’ whereabouts.

The operation was intended to eliminate top Iranian military officials in a secretive strike reminiscent of the notorious “Red Wedding” scenario from Game of Thrones.

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

Revealed: Israeli military creating ChatGPT-like tool using vast collection of Palestinian surveillance data
============================================================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

The powerful new AI model is designed to analyze intercepted communications – but experts say such systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes

Israel’s military surveillance agency has used a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian communications to build a powerful artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT that it hopes will transform its spying capabilities, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal.

The joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found Unit 8200 trained the AI model to understand spoken Arabic using large volumes of telephone conversations and text messages, obtained through its extensive surveillance of the occupied territories.

According to sources familiar with the project, the unit began building the model to create a sophisticated chatbot-like tool capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring and providing insights into the massive volumes of surveillance data it collects.

The elite eavesdropping agency, comparable in its capabilities with the US National Security Agency (NSA), accelerated its development of the system after the start of the war in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 in October 2023. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”

Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.

The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.

A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the new LLM, but said the military “deploys various intelligence methods to identify and thwart terrorist activity by hostile organisations in the Middle East”.

A vast pool of Arabic-language communications
---------------------------------------------

Unit 8200 has developed an array of AI-powered tools in recent years. Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.

Initially, Israeli military intelligence struggled to build a model on this scale. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.

The UK’s spy agencies [are also developing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/01/uk-intelligence-spy-agencies-relax-burdensome-laws-ai-data-bpds)
 their own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.

But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.

One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.

Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.

Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining \[an\] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.

Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.

Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.

In February, the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108)
 AI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls. It is not clear whether it has yet been deployed.

The efforts to build the large language model (LLM) – a deep learning system that generates human-like text – were partially revealed in a little-noticed public talk by a former military intelligence technologist who said he oversaw the project.

“We tried to create the largest dataset possible \[and\] collect all the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic,” the former official, Chaked Roger Joseph Sayedoff, told an audience at a military AI conference in Tel Aviv last year."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Human Rights Watch article ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)) discusses the Israeli military's use of digital tools, including mobile phone location tracking, using methods like cell tower triangulation and GPS data access (<image:k>). A Caliber.Az article ([https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike](https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike)) mentions Israeli intelligence tracking Iranian leaders by monitoring their bodyguards' cell phones and social media activity (<image:12313>, <image:12315>, <image:12317>, <image:12319>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance)) reports on the Israeli military's use of AI, including a ChatGPT-like tool and Unit 8200's analysis of intercepted communications for target selection (<image:12325>, <image:12326>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, including mobile phone location tracking via cell tower triangulation and GPS data, as well as monitoring social media activity. While the initial evidence suggests a possible link between WhatsApp and the assassination, the new evidence broadens the scope of potential tracking methods used by Israeli intelligence.

The claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The new evidence provides context on the methods used by Israeli intelligence, but it does not directly confirm or deny the use of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

To verify the claim, specific evidence linking WhatsApp to the tracking of Haniyeh is needed.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

The claim is supported by the evidence, as it indicates a possible link between Israeli intelligence, WhatsApp, and the tracking of Haniyeh.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there are unconfirmed reports and suggestions of WhatsApp's involvement in tracking Ismail Haniyeh, the evidence is not conclusive. However, the search results indicate that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, and there are claims and suggestions that spyware, possibly including WhatsApp, was used in the assassination.

Given the evidence, the claim is not definitively proven, but there are indications of a possible link between Israeli intelligence, WhatsApp, and the tracking of Haniyeh. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Based on the evidence, the claim is neither definitively confirmed nor refuted. While there are unconfirmed reports and suggestions of WhatsApp's involvement in tracking Ismail Haniyeh, the evidence is not conclusive. However, there are claims and suggestions that spyware, possibly including WhatsApp, was used in the assassination.

Photo of Turkish man holding hand of dead daughter underlines earthquake despair

Image showing father from Kahramanmaraş region comes as death toll from Syria and Turkey quake pushes past 7,800

Videos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 7,800 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks concertinaing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a [castle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/fears-for-ancient-sites-after-earthquake-destroys-parts-of-gaziantep-castle-turkey)
 that had stood for almost two millennia.

But few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmaraş, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.

Sitting hunched in the rubble, Mesut Hancer keeps hold of 15-year-old Irmak as she lies on her bed beneath the slabs of concrete, smashed windows and broken bricks that were once apartments. Close to the father and daughter, a man with a sledgehammer tries to smash his way through the ruins.

The epicentre of the first earthquake was the Pazarcık district of Kahramanmaraş, which lies in south-east [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey)
. The initial, 7.8-magnitude earthquake was followed, hours later, by a second quake that measured 7.7 magnitude.

Elsewhere in Kahramanmaraş province, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble. One lay on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Rescuers quieted the throngs of people trying to help so they could hear survivors and find them.

On the other side of the border, the Associated Press described seeing a Syrian man holding a dead girl in his arms as he walked away from the debris of a collapsed two-storey building.

He and a woman set the girl on the floor under covering to protect her from the rain, wrapping her in a large blanket before looking back to the building. According to Agence France-Presse, [a newborn baby was pulled alive from the rubble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/syria-newborn-still-joined-to-dead-mother-pulled-alive-from-earthquake-rubble)
 of a home in northern Syria after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday’s quake.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by dozens of continuing aftershocks, freezing winter weather and the damage caused to roads leading in and out of the affected areas.

On Tuesday evening, the Turkish government said 4,500 people had been killed in the quake, with another 26,000 injured. The number of confirmed deaths on the Syrian side of the border – where the disaster has exacerbated the destruction wrought by more than 11 years of civil war – stood at at least 1,700 bringing the death toll in both countries to more than 6,200. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes disaster zones, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.

As men clamber over the ruins of the pancaked building, now shaped like a pyramid of rubble, one man sits still. 

Wearing an orange coat to protect himself from the winter freeze, Mesut Hançer perches on concrete slabs and twisted rebar — all that remains of the apartment block in Kahramanmaras, a Turkish city close to [the epicenter of Monday’s earthquake](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/oliveburd/turkey-syria-earthquake-photos)
. 

His face is still — his expression, blank. He is grief-stricken but resolute: He won’t let go of his daughter’s hand. 

  ! <image:12479>

Irmak, 15, was killed when the building collapsed. The girl’s body is sandwiched between a mattress, dirt, and the colossal weight of the upper floors of the building. All that peeks out is a lifeless, pale hand that her father steadfastly grips. 

“He never left the hand of his daughter who died in the earthquake,” wrote Adem Atlan, the photographer with Agence France-Presse who took the pictures of the grieving father on Tuesday, in an Instagram story uploaded Wednesday. 

"Unbelievable pain," he later [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CochRLEq1H8/)
.

Adem Altan / AFP via Getty Images

Altan’s photos [went viral online](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1622977020194959360)
 and were printed on newspaper front pages around the world on Wednesday from Turkey to Spain to the UK to the US. 

“With the courage of despair,” read the headline accompanying the photo in [Belgium's De Standaard newspaper](https://www.standaard.be/krant/archief)
. 

“A glimpse of pain and desperation among the ruins,” Brazil’s O Globo paper wrote in its headline for the picture. 

A 2015 photo of Mesut and Irmak uploaded by the girl [to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=846968168721806&set=pb.100002258936209.-2207520000.&type=3)
 shows the father and daughter smiling as they pose by a small water fountain. Almost eight years later, a different photo of the pair has been seen across the globe and become a defining image of tragedy.

Irmak is just one of a horrifyingly large number of people killed by Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has devastated large swaths of Turkey and neighboring Syria.

More than 20,000 people are known to have died, according to [tallies from the Associated Press on Thursday](https://apnews.com/article/politics-syria-government-damascus-turkey-6ba6f153102945d93340dbf55e63d4bf)
, making the disaster one of the deadliest of the last decade. 

There are few more traumatized corners of the globe that the quake could have struck than Syria’s northwest. 

That country, plagued for more than a decade by a civil war that has wrought devastation and triggered a global refugee crisis, already had 15 million people in need of humanitarian aid even before the tremor began, according to David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.

“One of the deadliest earthquakes this century, followed by hundreds of aftershocks, now adds to a litany of devastation,” Miliband said in a statement shared with BuzzFeed News, calling for aid to begin “skyrocketing” in order to meet the desperate need.

Search and rescue efforts in the Besnaya district of Idlib, Syria, on Thursday. 

On Thursday, three days after the quake, the first convoy of aid trucks finally reached the opposition-held Idlib area in Syria’s northwest. The trucks arrived via the only crossing with the Turkish border that the United Nations has authorized for use but that had been blocked for days by damage.  

However, the White Helmets, a humanitarian group that assists in the region, said the aid was merely the same supplies that had preceded the disaster. “It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble,” the group [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1623667466860740608)
. “We are disappointed at a time when we are desperate for equipment that will help us save lives from under the rubble.”

Almost 2,000 people have died in the region, according to the White Helmets. Many of the dead had fled destruction and violence elsewhere in Syria only to lose their lives when buildings collapsed there.

As time passes, hopes dim that more people will be found alive — but there are still miracles. On Thursday, the White Helmets shared a photo of a young girl named Sham being pulled from the rubble. The group said her two siblings were also saved, but their mother was killed. 

Among the international figures who have arrived in the region to assist in relief and recovery efforts are a small contingent of 87 rescue workers from Ukraine, which itself has been plagued by war for the past year.

 of the workers searching damaged buildings in Turkey for signs of life.

"Our first task is search and rescue operations — to find the living people!” spokesperson Oleksandr Khorunzhiy [said](https://www.facebook.com/MNS.GOV.UA/posts/pfbid02pY78BwEzgveGq9rCJ14ZwhcSs4zk4iNjdKCypYG3aLEgRiuyRmEf86W4QoAY2GVql)

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand)), BuzzFeed News ([https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl)) all published articles about the image.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in February 2023. The event occurred in Turkey, not Gaza, and the date was February 2023, not July 2024.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows a man in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not in Gaza in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the location, date, and context of the image. `false`

 [! The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

**The quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is fake. No such statement appears on any of the actor’s official pages, nor has it been reported by any reputable media outlet.**

The quote about the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government, allegedly made by Dwayne Johnson, is fabricated. Johnson expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.

![Dwayne Johnson](https://mythdetector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sotsialur-qselshi-israelthan-dakavshirebith-duein-jonsonis-gaqhalbebuli-tsitata-vrtseldeba-2.png "sotsialur qselshi israelthan dakavshirebith duein jonsonis gaqhalbebuli tsitata vrtseldeba 2 | mythdetector.com")

__Screenshot of Dwayne Johnson’s post__

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)
 by the organization Snopes.

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

**About the Source:**

Among others, the fake quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is being spread by a Facebook account belonging to [Zaal Mamatsashvili](https://www.facebook.com/zaal.mamatsashvili/posts/pfbid02ZV5icDdtmZzamBaPfkzkBa1LbrBuTVdevkkWGkfsuRSLoZVoFnzTAvrBqKq47j7l)

The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are heartless criminals with no shred of humanity."

'Worst-case scenario' famine crisis in Gaza

The quote attributed to Johnson began circulating online in late July, at around the same time the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification [said](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/countries-in-focus-archive/issue-133/en/)
 on July 29 that, due to Israel's ongoing military offensive and [blockade](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-30-2025-9b9b516f22e61bd1dde879733fdd97aa)
, about 2 million Palestinians in Gaza were living in the "worst-case scenario of famine."

For further reading, a previous fact-check article [examined](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-tiktok-video-wrongly-192800744.html)
 whether a video truly showed actor Harrison Ford calling pro-Palestinian supporters a "force of nature."

#### Sources:

"IPC ALERT: Worst-Case Scenario of Famine Unfolding in the Gaza Strip." _Integrated Food Security Phase Classification_, 29 Jul. In that user's July 24 post, the quote had a different ending, reading, "The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are sons of a b\*\*\*\*."

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”
