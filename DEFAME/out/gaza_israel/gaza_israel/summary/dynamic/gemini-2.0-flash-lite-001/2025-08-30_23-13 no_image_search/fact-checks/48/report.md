## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, that Donald Trump allegedly called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal, as reported in an article by Jordan King. The American Muckrackers PAC accused Trump of violating the Logan Act. Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place. ([https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248)) ![image 11382](media/2025-08-30_23-48-1756597720-658701.jpg)

The Guardian published an article on January 15, 2025, discussing the impact of Donald Trump's return on Gaza ceasefire negotiations, mentioning a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Benjamin Netanyahu. ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/a-stern-message-how-return-of-trump-loomed-over-gaza-ceasefire-negotiations)) ![image 11388](media/2025-08-30_23-48-1756597727-231675.jpg) CNN reported that Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Donald Trump on December 15, 2024, to discuss the war on Hamas in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests conflicting information regarding the claim. Newsweek reported on August 22, 2024, about an alleged phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, discussing a ceasefire deal, but both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The Guardian mentioned a phone call from Trump's special envoy to Netanyahu, but it does not specify the date or the content of the call. CNN reported a call on December 15, 2024, but it does not mention the content of the call.

The Newsweek article is the only one that mentions the date in the claim. However, the article does not provide any information about Trump's alleged motivation to stop the ceasefire deal.

The claim cannot be verified because the evidence does not confirm the content of the phone call and Trump's alleged motivation.

Tehran Times ([https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502791/Probe-called-into-Trump-Netanyahu-dealings-to-prolong-Gaza-war](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502791/Probe-called-into-Trump-Netanyahu-dealings-to-prolong-Gaza-war)) reported that American Muckrakers asked for an investigation into reports that Trump was lobbying Netanyahu to influence a Gaza ceasefire. The report cited an alleged phone call on August 14, where Trump urged Netanyahu not to cut a deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign. Both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. The New Indian Express ([https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report)) also reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to reject a Gaza ceasefire deal, fearing it might help Kamala Harris in the upcoming elections, mentioning a report of a phone call on August 14, 2024, which coincided with the collapse of ceasefire talks. Trump and Netanyahu denied the call. ![image 1](media/0.jpg) ![image 11416](media/2025-08-30_23-49-1756597763-249711.jpg) ![image 11418](media/2025-08-30_23-49-1756597776-753856.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence provides more details about the claim. Both the Tehran Times and The New Indian Express reported that Trump allegedly urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, citing a phone call on August 14, 2024. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

The claim is supported by reports from multiple news sources, which state that Trump's alleged motivation was to hinder Kamala Harris' campaign. However, the denial of the call by both Trump and Netanyahu casts doubt on the veracity of the claim.

The claim's veracity is **unclear** due to conflicting reports and denials from the involved parties.


## Final Judgement
The claim is based on reports that Trump urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Kamala Harris' campaign, allegedly during a phone call on August 14, 2024. However, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While reports from the Tehran Times and The New Indian Express ([https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/21/trump-allegedly-urged-netanyahu-to-avert-gaza-ceasefire-deal-fearing-it-may-help-harris-in-elections-report)) state that Trump allegedly made the call on August 14, 2024, and urged Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal to hurt Kamala Harris' campaign, both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call ever took place.
