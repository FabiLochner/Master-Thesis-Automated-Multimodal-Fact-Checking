Geldof performing as a solo artist in 1987

Geldof left the Boomtown Rats in 1986 to launch a solo career and publish his autobiography, _Is That It?_,[\[6\]](#cite_note-GeldofBio-6)
 which was a UK best-seller.

His first solo records sold reasonably well and spawned the hit singles "This Is The World Calling" (co-written with [Dave Stewart](/wiki/Dave_Stewart_(Eurythmics) "Dave Stewart (Eurythmics)")
 of [Eurythmics](/wiki/Eurythmics "Eurythmics")
) and "The Great Song of Indifference". In 1998, he [erroneously announced](/wiki/List_of_premature_obituaries "List of premature obituaries")
 [Ian Dury](/wiki/Ian_Dury "Ian Dury")
's death from cancer, possibly due to hoax information from a listener who was disgruntled at the station's change of ownership.[\[29\]](#cite_note-29)
 The event caused music paper _[NME](/wiki/NME "NME")
_ (who had been involved in a running feud with Geldof since his Boomtown Rats days—primarily due to his disparagement of [The Clash](/wiki/The_Clash "The Clash")
) to call Geldof 'the world's worst DJ'.[\[30\]](#cite_note-30)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg/250px-Breiti%2C_Campino%2C_Bob_Geldof.jpg)](/wiki/File:Breiti,_Campino,_Bob_Geldof.jpg)

Geldof performing with [Die Toten Hosen](/wiki/Die_Toten_Hosen "Die Toten Hosen")
 at Your Voice Against Poverty concert in [Rostock](/wiki/Rostock,_Germany "Rostock, Germany")
, Germany on 7 June 2007

Along with [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
's Bono, he has devoted much time since 2000 to campaigning for [debt relief](/wiki/Debt_relief "Debt relief")
 for developing countries. In November 2014, Geldof announced that he would be forming a further incarnation of Band Aid, to be known as [Band Aid 30](/wiki/Band_Aid_(band)#Band_Aid_30 "Band Aid (band)")
, to record an updated version of the [charity single](/wiki/Charity_record "Charity record")
, with the proceeds going to treat victims of the [Ebola virus](/wiki/Ebola_virus_disease "Ebola virus disease")
 in West Africa.[\[42\]](#cite_note-42)

### Live Aid

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Live Aid")\
\]

Main article: [Live Aid](/wiki/Live_Aid "Live Aid")

> "The greatest legacy of Live Aid for me personally, is the example of how Bob Geldof's leadership demonstrated the power of the individual. Some journalists have suggested that the Derg was able to use Live Aid and [Oxfam](/wiki/Oxfam "Oxfam")
 money to fund its enforced resettlement and "villagification" programmes, under which at least 3 million people are said to have been displaced and between 50,000 and 100,000 killed.[\[50\]](#cite_note-50)
[\[51\]](#cite_note-51)
 However, in November 2010 the BBC formally apologised to Geldof for misleading implications in its stories on the subject of Band Aid, saying it had 'no evidence' that Band Aid money specifically went to buy weapons.[\[52\]](#cite_note-52)

### Commission for Africa

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Commission for Africa")\
\]

In January 2004, on a visit to friends in Africa, Geldof came to believe that more people were at risk of starvation there than had died in the famine of 1984/85 which had prompted Live Aid. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice and Equity.[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The 2013 report outlined issues relating to oil, gas and mining in Africa.

### DATA and One Campaign

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Bob_Geldof&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: DATA and One Campaign")\
\]

Bob Geldof worked closely with [DATA](/wiki/DATA "DATA")
 (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa), an organisation founded by U2's Bono in 2002 to promote debt relief, third-world trade and AIDS relief in Africa. Brand responded by saying "It's no wonder Bob Geldof knows so much about famine – he's been dining out on '[I Don't Like Mondays](/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays "I Don't Like Mondays")
' for 30 years".[\[67\]](#cite_note-67)
 Then, in mid-July 2006, he infuriated many New Zealanders by criticising the New Zealand government's foreign aid contribution as "shameful" and "pathetic".[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)
 [Winston Peters](/wiki/Winston_Peters "Winston Peters")
, the [Minister of Foreign Affairs](/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(New_Zealand) "Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)")
 responded that Geldof failed to recognise the "quality" of New Zealand aid as well as other New Zealand contributions.[\[69\]](#cite_note-69)

During mid-November 2008, a local for-profit organisation, Diversity@Work, invited Geldof to Melbourne, to speak about Third World poverty and the failure of governments to combat the crisis. He said the EU was "a mess" but warned Britain's young people had their futures "taken from them" as a result of the referendum.[\[108\]](#cite_note-108)

Ahead of the [2024 United Kingdom general election](/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election "2024 United Kingdom general election")
 Geldof posted a video endorsing the re-election of [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)")
 candidate and [Minister of State for Development and Africa](/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Development_and_Africa "Minister of State for Development and Africa")
 [Andrew Mitchell](/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell "Andrew Mitchell")
.[\[109\]](#cite_note-109)

In July 2025, Geldof accused Israeli authorities of "lying" about the [famine](/wiki/Gaza_Strip_famine "Gaza Strip famine")
 caused by the [Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip](/wiki/Israeli_blockade_of_the_Gaza_Strip_(2023%E2%80%93present) "Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip (2023–present)")
.[\[110\]](#cite_note-a-110)
 "Israel is preventing food from reaching hungry, terrified, and exhausted mothers. The coroner was satisfied that this voice was Hutchence arguing with Geldof.[\[135\]](#cite_note-HandInquestReport-135)
[\[136\]](#cite_note-Hand-136)

Geldof later went to court and obtained full custody of his three children.[\[137\]](#cite_note-auto-137)
 He has since become an outspoken advocate of [fathers' rights](/wiki/Fathers%27_rights "Fathers' rights")
.[\[138\]](#cite_note-138)
 After Yates' death from a heroin overdose in 2000,[\[139\]](#cite_note-139)
[\[140\]](#cite_note-140)
 Geldof became the legal guardian of Tiger Hutchence[\[141\]](#cite_note-141)
 and later adopted her in 2007.[\[142\]](#cite_note-142)
[\[143\]](#cite_note-143)
 As of 2022, Tiger's legal name is Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence-Geldof.[\[144\]](#cite_note-144)

In April 2014, his daughter Peaches died at the age of 25, of a heroin overdose.[\[145\]](#cite_note-145)
[\[146\]](#cite_note-146)
 Geldof stated the family was "beyond pain" after he confirmed the news of her death.[\[147\]](#cite_note-147)
[\[148\]](#cite_note-148)

Geldof announced his engagement to French actress Jeanne Marine, his partner of 18 years, on 1 May 2014, and they were married in France on 28 April 2015.[\[149\]](#cite_note-149)
[\[150\]](#cite_note-150)
 They currently reside in [Battersea](/wiki/Battersea "Battersea")
, South London.[\[151\]](#cite_note-151)

Regarding his [Jewish](/wiki/Jew "Jew")
 ancestry, in an interview with the Manchester-based _[Jewish Telegraph](/wiki/Jewish_Telegraph "Jewish Telegraph")
_, Geldof said "I was a quarter Catholic, a quarter Protestant, a quarter Jewish and a quarter nothing – the nothing won."[\[152\]](#cite_note-152)

According to [The Sunday Times Rich List](/wiki/The_Sunday_Times_Rich_List "The Sunday Times Rich List")
, Geldof was worth £32 million in 2012.[\[153\]](#cite_note-153)

Music legend Mary Coughlan has criticised the reaction of Live Aid founder [Bob Geldof](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bob-geldof)
 on Gaza.

The 1985 fundraising concert was famously conceived by Geldof after he was moved and angered by images of people starving to death in Ethiopia. I’d have no problem saying it to them if I met them.”

Coughlan is the first guest on the podcast hosted by Kevin Dundon, and journalist and foodie, Caoimhe Young, which sees personalities speaking about dishes from their past. In a new culinary-themed podcast, Under the Grill, Coughlan says she can’t understand why the Boomtown Rats frontman and the Dubliner star – who have both called for peace in the Middle East – haven’t used their global platforms to speak out about the situation in the way they did with Live Aid in the 1980s.

The singer, who has been vocal in her support for Palestine, said: “We all saved the world when Bob and [Bono](https://www.dublinlive.ie/all-about/bono)
 were talking about saving the world, and I couldn’t understand what was different about this situation in Gaza. Why \[would\] they would be so quiet about it?"

Orthodox Ethiopian Christians celebrate Christmas on 7 January

Forty years on from the original recording, the cream of British and Irish pop music past and present are once again asking whether Ethiopians know it is Christmas.

In 1984, responding to horrific images of the famine in northern Ethiopia broadcast on the BBC, musicians Bob Geldof and Midge Ure corralled some of the biggest stars of the era to record a charity song.

The release of the Band Aid single, and the Live Aid concert that followed eight months later, became seminal moments in celebrity fundraising and set a template that many others followed.

'We knew Christmas before you' - the Band Aid fallout
=====================================================

A few weeks after the BBC film was broadcast in October 1984, Bob Geldof (L) and Midge Ure (R) managed to persuade the top musicians to turn up on a Sunday at a recording studio in west London

As the head of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission he had managed to smuggle the TV crew into the country. It’s still saying there’s death in every tear," he said referring to the lyrics of the 2014 version.

"I go to Ghana every Christmas… every December so we know there’s peace and joy in Africa this Christmas, we know there isn’t death in every tear."

Fuse ODG does not deny that there are problems to be resolved but "Band Aid takes one issue from one country and paints the whole continent with it".

The way that Africans were portrayed in this and other fundraising efforts had had a direct effect on him, he said.

When growing up "it was not cool to be African in the UK… \[because of\] the way that I looked, people were making fun of me", the singer said.

Research into the impact of charity fundraisers by British-Nigerian King’s College lecturer Edward Ademolu backs this up.

He himself remembers the short films shot in Africa by Comic Relief, which had been influenced by Band Aid, and that his "African peers at \[a British\] primary school would passionately deny their African roots, calling all Africans - with great certainty - smelly, unintelligent and equated them to wild animals".

Images of dangerously thin Africans became common currency in efforts to elicit funds.

The cover for the original Band Aid single, designed by pop artist Sir Peter Blake, features colourful Christmas scenes contrasted with two gaunt Ethiopian children, in black and white, each eating what looks like a life-saving biscuit.

For part of the poster for the Live Aid concert the following year, Sir Peter used a photograph of the back of an anonymous, naked, skeletal child.

That image was used again in the art work for the 2004 release and it has appeared once more this year.

For many working in the aid sector, as well as academics who study it, there is shock and surprise that the song and its imagery keep coming back.

The umbrella body Bond, which works with more than 300 charities including Christian Aid, Save the Children and Oxfam, has been very critical of the release of the new mix.

"Initiatives like Band Aid 40 perpetuate outdated narratives, reinforce racism and colonial attitudes that strip people of their dignity and agency," Lena Bheeroo, [Bond’s head of anti-racism and equity, said in a statement](https://www.bond.org.uk/press-releases/2024/11/band-aid-40-reinforces-harmful-stereotypes-and-colonial-attitudes-bond-statement/)
.

Geldof had previously dismissed the idea that Band Aid's work was relying on "colonial tropes".

The way that charities raise funds has undergone big changes in recent years.

! This was despite the government at that time, which was marking 10 years of Marxist rule and fighting a civil war, not wanting news of the famine to get out.

"The way the British people responded so generously strengthened my faith in humanity," he says, speaking from Namibia where he now works.

He praises the "young and passionate people" behind Band Aid - describing them as "amazing".

His questioning of the song, whilst also recognising its impact, sums up the debate for many who might feel that when lives need to be saved the ends justify the means.

Geldof was typically robust in defending it responding to [a recent article in The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/band-aid-at-40-how-the-problematic-christmas-hit-changed-the-charity-sector-241649)
 about the "problematic Christmas hit".

"It’s a pop song \[expletive\]… The same argument has been made many times over the years and elicits the same wearisome response," he is quoted as saying.

"This little pop song has kept hundreds of thousands if not millions of people alive."

He also recognises that Ethiopians celebrate Christmas but says that in 1984 "ceremonies were abandoned".

In an email to the BBC, Joe Cannon, the chief financial officer of the Band Aid Trust, said that in the past seven months the charity has given more than £3m ($3.8m) helping as many as 350,000 people through a host of projects in Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, Somaliland and Chad.

He adds that Band Aid’s swift action as a "first responder" encourages others to donate where funds are lacking, especially in northern Ethiopia, which is once again emerging from a civil war.

But this is not enough to dampen the disquiet.

In the last week, [Ed Sheeran has said he is not happy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k03qz5jqno)
 about his voice from the 2014 recording - made to raise funds for the West African Ebola crisis - being used as his "understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed".

He was influenced by British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG, who himself had refused to take part a decade ago.

"The world has changed but Band Aid hasn’t," he told the BBC’s Focus on Africa podcast this week.

"It’s saying there’s no peace and joy in Africa this Christmas. <image:11430>Getty Images

In 1984, U2's Bono sang one of the most memorable lines of the song: "Tonight thank God it's them instead of you"

While remaining critical, Kenyan satirist and writer Patrick Gathara, who often mocks Western views of Africa, agrees things have shifted.

"There has been a push within humanitarian agencies to start seeing people in a crisis first as human beings and not as victims, and I think that’s a big, big change," he tells the BBC.

"In the days of Live Aid, all you really had were these images of starvation and suffering… the idea that these are people were incapable of doing anything for themselves and that was always a misconception."

The fallout from the Black Lives Matter protests added impetus to the change that was already happening.

A decade ago, a Norwegian organisation Radi-Aid made it its mission to highlight the way that Africa and Africans were presented in fundraising campaigns using humour.

For example, it co-ordinated a mock campaign to get Africans to send radiators to Norwegians who were supposedly suffering in the cold.

In 2017, [Sheeran himself won one of their "Rusty Radiator" awards](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-42268637)
 for a film he made for Comic Relief in Liberia in which he offered to pay for some homeless Liberian children to be put up in a hotel room.

The organisers of the awards said "the video should be less about Ed shouldering the burden alone but rather appealing to the wider world to step in".

University of East Anglia academic David Girling, who once wrote a report for Radi-Aid, argues that its work is one of the reasons that things have shifted.

More and more charities are introducing ethical guidelines for their campaigns, he says.

"People have woken up to the damage that can be caused," he tells the BBC.

Prof Girling’s own research, carried out in Kibera, a slum area in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, showed that campaigns involving and centred on those who are the targets of the charitable assistance could be more effective than the traditional top down efforts.

Many charities are still under pressure to use celebrities to help raise awareness and money."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that in November 2024, Bono and Bob Geldof were involved in discussions and events related to the 40th anniversary of Band Aid and faced criticism for their silence on the situation in Gaza. However, there is no mention of a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.

The Dublin Live article specifically criticizes Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza, which contradicts the claim that they were organizing a tour to aid the Israeli army.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Abstract
--------

The Israeli State recently announced that it may begin to use genetic tests to determine whether potential immigrants are Jewish or not. This development would demand a rethinking of Israeli law on the issue of the definition of Jewishness. In this article, we discuss the historical and legal context of secular and religious definitions of Jewishness and rights to immigration in the State of Israel. In conclusion, we raise several questions about future potential impacts of Jewish genetics on Israeli law and society.

A DNA Test Can Confirm Jewish Ancestry
======================================

In certain cases, the right to repatriation can be supported by genetic testing (DNA test), which serves to establish a biological relationship with an individual whose Jewish origin has already been officially documented.

**Important:**  
DNA test results are legally valid only if the test is conducted pursuant to an order issued by an Israeli court and carried out in accordance with the prescribed legal procedure.

How to Prove Jewish Ancestry Through a DNA Test
-----------------------------------------------

If an applicant lacks sufficient documentation confirming Jewish ancestry, the Israeli consul may, following an interview, recommend undergoing genetic testing—or even issue a refusal of the repatriation request. To avoid such outcomes, it is essential to have the documents reviewed in advance by a lawyer, especially if Jewish lineage is through the paternal line.

To conduct DNA testing, a court order from an Israeli court is required. If a refusal has already been issued by the Nativ representative at the consulate, a separate legal process to reinstate the right to repatriation will be necessary — after the DNA procedure has been completed.

A similar process applies to children born to an Israeli father if their birth was not reported to the Israeli consulate abroad within the required timeframe.

To initiate DNA testing, you should consult a licensed Israeli attorney who specializes in family and immigration law.

Step-by-Step DNA Testing Process
--------------------------------

How to properly conduct a DNA test so that the results are accepted for repatriation and citizenship by birth:

*   Gather documents confirming the need for testing;
*   Open a case with the Israeli Family Court (personal presence is not required; a licensed Israeli attorney represents the applicants by power of attorney);
*   Obtain approval from the State Attorney’s Office and a court order authorizing the test;
*   Conduct the test as instructed by the court in a certified laboratory in Israel and/or at an Israeli consulate abroad (test kits are sent via diplomatic mail from the Israeli lab). 
    If the relationship is distant, or if the test results indicate a percentage that does not meet the threshold for Israeli citizenship, a medical expert may be brought in, and/or a test may be conducted with a different relative.

How Is a DNA Test Conducted?
----------------------------

The lawyer, acting under power of attorney, files a petition with the court on behalf of the applicant and obtains permission to carry out genetic testing. The samples are then compared with those of the alleged father or other biological relatives.

If the biological father or his blood relatives reside in Israel, their consent is not required—they can be compelled to undergo testing by court order.

DNA testing is conducted exclusively in licensed laboratories in Israel. Tests performed privately or abroad are not recognized by Israeli courts and will not be accepted for legal purposes.

Why Do You Need a Specialized Lawyer?
-------------------------------------

It is not possible to prove Jewish ancestry through DNA testing without legal representation. The process is strictly regulated, and the court will not authorize genetic testing unless an attorney is involved.

If the test confirms the applicant’s biological relationship to a person whose Jewish ancestry is documented or to someone who already holds Israeli citizenship, the lawyer can proceed with the repatriation process or apply for citizenship status—particularly in cases involving a child born after the parent acquired Israeli citizenship.

In total, the process may take between 4 and 7 months.

While genetic testing can make the repatriation process more complex, for many applicants, it is the very tool that makes repatriation possible.

The attorneys at our firm have successfully helped hundreds of clients confirm their eligibility for repatriation through DNA testing and obtain Israeli citizenship.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Why is a DNA test needed to establish paternity in Israel?

DNA testing is commonly used to establish paternity when it was not legally recognized at birth or when the child was born outside of marriage. However, it is important to note that DNA testing must be conducted exclusively in certified laboratories in Israel. Results from tests performed abroad are not accepted by the Israeli authorities.

### How to properly conduct a DNA test for repatriation and obtaining Israeli citizenship?

DNA testing is carried out strictly by order of the Family Court in Israel."

Content: "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, in a social media post on Thursday, called for the annihilation of Iran if they ever assassinate him, following reports of such plots by Tehran.

[**His statement was made**](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112848319395019188)
 alongside a video clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the US Congress on Wednesday, where Netanyahu emphasized Iran's threats.

On Truth Social, Trump wrote, “If they do ‘assassinate President Trump,’ which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth — If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered ‘gutless’ cowards!”

, the security concerns for those involved in the decision to kill Soleimani remain significant, necessitating ongoing protection measures.

Trump's post echoes his controversial rhetoric from 2019, when he threatened the "obliteration" of Iran if they attacked "anything American."

    Behrouz Turani On July 13, twenty-year-old Thomas Michael Crooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing a former volunteer fire chief and injuring two others. Trump was slightly injured in his ear.

However, no direct link has been found between the reported Iranian plot and the attempted assassination.

[**In a recent interview**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202407182631)
 with Iran International, Trump's former national security aide John Bolton said that naturally Trump would take the Iranian threat personally.

Trump withdrew from the Obama-era JCPAO nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 and imposed heavy sanctions, that have crippled Iran's weak economy.

Relations between the US and Iran became more strained since the 2020 US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the former commander of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, and Iran's top military intelligence operative in the Middle East.

Iranian officials, both political and military, have persistently issued threats against Trump and former members of his administration to avenge Soleimani's death, who orchestrated Iran's proxy operations throughout the region. For instance, in February 2023, Amirali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards aerospace force, explicitly declared that the Islamic Republic intends to kill Trump.

In January 2022, Iran's [**former President Ebrahim Raisi**](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202201033940)
 vowed retaliation for Soleimani's killing unless former US President Donald Trump was brought to trial.

"If Trump and (former Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo are not tried in a fair court for the criminal act of assassinating General Soleimani, Muslims will take our martyr's revenge," Raisi said in a televised speech.

In 2022, the US Justice Department brought charges against a member of the IRGC for plotting to assassinate John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, likely in retaliation for Soleimani's death. Similar threats have been directed at other former Trump administration officials, including Mike Pompeo and Robert O'Brien, who continue to have security details due to ongoing risks.

Soleimani played a crucial role in Iran's external military and intelligence operations, often orchestrating hostilities against US forces in the region."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses a joint meeting of Congress in the chamber of the House of Representatives at the U.S. and internationally-backed cease-fire proposal are limping along in Cairo as parties struggle to finalize a path forward for the Palestinian territories following the war, according to [numerous](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/19/nx-s1-5046255/israel-hamas-ceasefire-ukraine-russia-united-states-antony-blinken)

. Capitol on July 24, 2024 in Washington, D.C. “Ladies and gentlemen, that victory is in sight.”

The Israeli leader visited Washington as his military’s airstrikes in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis added dozens of deaths to a mounting toll of 39,000, according to Gaza health authorities in the Hamas-controlled territory.

Additionally, [news](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-declares-two-more-gaza-hostages-dead-2024-07-22/)

Israel’s offensive, approaching its tenth month, has been ongoing since Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Oct. Senate.

Rather, the likely Democratic presidential nominee departed Washington Wednesday morning for a speech in Indianapolis, followed by travel to Houston.

Harris’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Both Biden and Harris are expected to meet Netanyahu separately on Thursday, followed by a joint meeting with the families of American hostages still held by Hamas.

“The leaders will discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region,” according to a statement released Wednesday by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The Republican National Committee pounced on Harris’s absence in a statement, calling it “disgraceful snub” and accusing the vice president of being “weak” on Israel.

The Senate’s president pro tempore, Patty Murray of Washington, also did not preside, citing opposition to the war in a statement [reported](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jul/23/patty-murray-will-skip-israeli-prime-ministers-add/)

Instead, Sen. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, called Congress’s invitation to Netanyahu “wildly inappropriate” because the Israeli leader “has violated international human rights law so severely that an arrest warrant for war crimes has been recommended by the International Criminal Court.”

“I regret that one has not been issued yet, as I would have gladly served it to him on the House floor,” Pocan said in a statement Wednesday.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the rare Republican absence during Netanyahu’s address, dismissing it as “political theater on behalf of the State Department.”

“The purpose of having Netanyahu address Congress is to bolster his political standing in Israel and to quell (international) opposition to his war,” Massie [wrote](https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1816096291291623517)

CNN  — 

Former President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-45)
 met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, the first such meeting between the two men since Trump left the White House more than three years ago.

The meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was requested by Netanyahu, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee, [conveyed a forcefulness](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 on civilian suffering and ending the war following her time with the prime minister.

Netanyahu said Friday that he hoped Harris’ comments would not make a ceasefire deal harder to reach.

“I think to the extent that Hamas understands there’s no daylight between Israel and the United States, that expedites the deal,” said Netanyahu to reporters at his meeting with Trump. I actually don’t know how a person who is Jewish could vote for her, but that’s up to them.”

Ahead of Netanyahu’s remarks, [Harris’ office rejected on Friday](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/26/politics/harris-team-netanyahu-meeting-reaction/index.html)
 the suggestion originally from a senior Israeli official that the [vice president’s remarks](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/harris-netanyahu-israel-hamas-ceasefire/index.html)
 could have made [a ceasefire deal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/biden-netanyahu-meeting/index.html)
 harder to reach.

“I don’t know what they’re talking about,” a Harris aide told CNN, in response to a senior Israeli official being quoted in [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/harris-i-wont-stay-silent-on-gaza-suffering-israel-charges-shes-harming-deal-chances/)
.

“President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu: it is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done,” the aide to the vice president told reporters, adding that Harris’ meeting with Netanyahu was “serious and collegial.”

Trump elaborated on his own meeting with Netanyahu while continuing to slam Harris during a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday night.

“She doesn’t like Jewish people. However, their relationship has soured in recent years, and the former president has been reluctant to speak with him throughout the ongoing conflict.

In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’ attack on Israel, Trump criticized Netanyahu for his handling of the war, claiming to Fox News at the time the prime minister and the country overall were “unprepared.”

Part of that criticism, which Trump has continued in the months since, stems from his complicated relationship with Netanyahu, one that a former Trump administration official described as “a love-hate relationship,” who added that the two leaders experienced a dramatic up and down in recent years.

During his administration Trump enacted multiple policies to Israel’s benefit, including moving the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and backing multiple countries in Middle East and North Africa to normalize relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords. The letter was sent after the assassination attempt on the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

“Looking forward to seeing Bibi Netanyahu on Friday, and even more forward to achieving Peace in the Middle East!” Trump posted to Truth Social with the letter.

In posting that engagement with Abbas, Trump was trying to “strike a balance” going into the meeting, Bahbah said, adding that he hopes Trump will come out of the Netanyahu meeting calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.

Jewish supporters of Trump are hoping the former president asks Netanyahu what he needs to win the ongoing war, explained Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican and Trump supporter.

“At the table, the most important question is asking the prime minister what he needs to win. CNN’s Katelyn Polantz and New York Times White House Correspondent Maggie Haberman explain the details of this decision.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/trump-tariffs-fed-appeals-ct-digvid.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_250,c_fill)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that on July 25, 2024, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Trump's post on July 25, 2024, stated, "I hope that America obliterates Israel." Instead, one article mentions a post where Trump called for the annihilation of Iran. Another article mentions Trump welcoming Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago.

The evidence does mention an attempted assassination on July 13, 2024, at a Trump rally. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote from the claim.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the provided evidence.

On Wednesday, September 18, reports of a second wave of explosions began to come in from Lebanon, mostly from Beirut. Today, iPhones and other electronics were exploded.

As of 21:00, the Lebanese Ministry of Health reported 14 dead and 450 injured in the new wave of explosions. Later, the media reported at least 500 injured. Among them are several children and health workers. The attack again predominantly targeted members of «Hezbollah».

The video shows many explosions in the city.

In addition to the streets and public places, electrical appliances explode in apartments, houses and shops (about 60 cases), as well as cars (at least 15 cases). Among other things, funeral processions of «Hezbollah» officials killed in yesterday’s explosions were hit by the explosions.

An explosion during a funeral.

Among the explosive devices, the media name Apple iPhones and other smartphones, laptops, scooters and mopeds, walkie-talkies, solar panels, and even electronic locks and kitchen appliances. Many sources claim that this includes any device that has a battery.

Explosion in one of the apartments.

Hezbollah also exploded stationary and mobile communication stations «Hezbollah» in buildings and cars. The organization called on its members to get rid of electronics altogether. In crowded places, representatives of «Hezbollah» ordered everyone present to turn off their electronic devices.

There is currently no accurate information on whether the series of explosions in Lebanon has ended. Various sources reported two waves of explosions during the afternoon.

An image showing an exploded iPhone is going viral on social media with the claim that an iPhone has exploded in Lebanon along with the recent blast of other electronic devices. The caption states, “iPhones exploding in #Lebanon blowing up random people”.

Let’s check the truth

[https://archive.org/details/c-image\_202409](https://archive.org/details/c-image_202409)

**Fact Check-** 

We started our investigation with a reverse image search on Google and the results led us to a report by the Egyptian outlet Cairo 24 published on 19 March 2021.According to the report, the image shows an iPhone explosion that caused severe injuries, including a broken arm to a kid. The incident had taken place in Maadi, Egypt.

! <image:11533>

[Archive link](https://archive.org/details/untitled_20240923_1305)

The report further states that a child named Hamza from Al Maadi, Egypt, suffered a broken arm while attempting to escape a fire that broke out after an iPhone exploded while it was charging. Following the incident, the father filed a police report, accusing the iPhone company of negligence, stating that the phone was less than a month old.

Moving forward, we found an article in an Arabic website named [nabd.com](https://nabd.com/s/85455852-535a14/)
 published on 20 March 2021 with the same details. It states a child was injured due to iPhone explosion in Maadi, Cairo.

**Conclusion**

Fact Crescendo found the claim made along with the viral image to be Misleading. This image of an exploded iPhone is from the 2021 incident in a suburb of Cairo, Egypt. Not from Lebanon.

“Well, it Depends”: The Explosive Pagers Attack Revisited
=========================================================

On 17 September, 2024, thousands of pagers distributed by Hezbollah to its operatives in Lebanon and Syria exploded. While no State acknowledged responsibility for these explosions, [media reports](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
 have strongly suggested that Israel is responsible for them.

[_New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/18/world/middleeast/israel-exploding-pagers-hezbollah.html)
 and [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/05/israel-mossad-hezbollah-pagers-nasrallah/)
 reporting suggests the following sequence of events. We note in this regard that between 8 October 2023 and 17 September 2024, [Hezbollah fired](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4893654-hezbollah-has-fired-more-than-8000-rockets-toward-israel-since-october-7-ambassador/)
 more than 8,000 rockets towards Israel, [reaching a peak](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/war-data/)
 of 1,300 rockets in the month of August alone. The fact that the Israeli major counter-attack was undertaken almost a year after Hezbollah’s attacks started, following a series of failed attempts to end Hezbollah’s use of force through resorting to more [measured military responses](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-strikes-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-military-says-2024-08-25/)
 and [diplomatic means](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2475451)
, appears to us to clearly meet the _jus ad bellum_ test of necessity.

In the same vein, the [argument](https://x.com/BCFinucane/status/1840416147360854526)
 that Israel was legally required to accept a ceasefire deal in Gaza—on terms which it considers [unacceptable](https://news.sky.com/story/israels-benjamin-netanyahu-rejects-ceasefire-deal-that-would-leave-hamas-intact-13129727)
 to it (i.e., which would leave Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip)—in order to stop Hezbollah’s rocket attacks, and that its failure to do so implies lack of military necessity, appears to us to be baseless. It has also been reported that the explosive charges installed in the pagers were relatively [small](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html)
, leading mostly to injuries and not deaths. As early as 2020, Hezbollah’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, warned members of the group against the use of cell phones, because he feared Israel was monitoring their cell phone conversations, and tracking their movements. In February 2024, Hezbollah decided to go “low tech” in order to evade Israel’s monitoring.

Anticipating this, Israel formed a shell corporation in Hungary called B.A.C. The actual explosion occurred shortly afterwards either by pager holders pressing two buttons manually with both of their hands to view the encrypted message or through a second activating message.

On 17 September, the detonation order was given and thousands of pagers exploded. Twelve persons were reportedly killed by the explosions (two of them children, most likely of Hezbollah operatives). On 18 September, a second set of explosions took place resulting in more casualties."

Background
----------

Main article: [Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)](/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(2023%E2%80%93present) "Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)")

Hezbollah was founded in 1982 by Lebanese clerics in response to the [Israeli invasion of Lebanon](/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War "1982 Lebanon War")
.[\[47\]](#cite_note-bbc-hi-me2-50)
[\[48\]](#cite_note-51)
[\[49\]](#cite_note-52)
 Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians.[\[50\]](#cite_note-aj-53)
 This quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel, impacting [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
.[\[51\]](#cite_note-54)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[52\]](#cite_note-55)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
,[\[53\]](#cite_note-56)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-57)
 where over [50,000 Palestinians have been killed](/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Gaza_war "Casualties of the Gaza war")
, with at least half identified as women and children.[\[55\]](#cite_note-58)
 From 8 October 2023 to 20 September 2024, Hezbollah has launched 1,900 cross border attacks, and Israel has launched another 8,300.[\[56\]](#cite_note-59)
 The fighting killed 564 in Lebanon (including 133 civilians)[\[57\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-60)
 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displacing entire communities in both countries,[\[57\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-60)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[58\]](#cite_note-61)

On 10 September, the Israeli Defense Minister [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
 said Israel was shifting its focus from Gaza to the northern border.[\[59\]](#cite_note-62)
 Israel's domestic security agency, [Shin Bet](/wiki/Shin_Bet "Shin Bet")
, announced it had thwarted a Hezbollah plot to assassinate a former senior defense official using an explosive device, and _[The Jerusalem Post](/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post "The Jerusalem Post")
_ speculated that the pager explosions may have been in retaliation.[\[60\]](#cite_note-63)
[\[61\]](#cite_note-64)

### Use of pagers

While popular in the late twentieth century, pagers have since largely been replaced by cell phones, except in hospitals.[\[62\]](#cite_note-65)
 Some Hezbollah members had used pagers for years before the [7 October attacks](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
, but more members began using them after February 2024, when Hezbollah secretary-general [Hassan Nasrallah](/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah "Hassan Nasrallah")
 called on members to stop using smartphones, citing Israel's capability to infiltrate them.[\[24\]](#cite_note-The_New_York_Times-3-26)
[\[25\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera-2-27)
 Hezbollah subsequently imported the pagers to Lebanon in the months before the explosion.[\[28\]](#cite_note-The_Times_of_Israel-30)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-CNN-2-29)
 Reuters was told that the explosives were not detected despite checks and the pagers were still being distributed immediately before the attack.[\[63\]](#cite_note-66)

Israeli agencies have previously carried out operations involving explosive communication devices—notably the assassination of Hamas operative [Yahya Ayyash](/wiki/Yahya_Ayyash "Yahya Ayyash")
 in 1996.[\[64\]](#cite_note-The_Economist-67)

In 2015, Mossad began planting booby-trapped walkie-talkies in Lebanon, which secretly allowed Israel to monitor Hezbollah communications while holding the option to detonate them.[\[65\]](#cite_note-:14-68)
 For nine years, Israel limited its use of these devices to surveillance. [Jump to content](#bodyContent)

Explosions
----------

### Day 1: exploding pagers

Security camera footage showing exploding pager in Beirut

On 17 September 2024 at around 15:30 EEST,[\[19\]](#cite_note-Associated_Press-21)
 many pagers across Lebanon and Syria unexpectedly exploded in an apparently coordinated attack on Hezbollah members, many of whom were seriously wounded.[\[85\]](#cite_note-The_New_York_Times-2-88)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-41)
[\[15\]](#cite_note-BBC-17)
 According to the [Lebanese Health Ministry](/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Health_(Lebanon) "Ministry of Public Health (Lebanon)")
, the vast majority of those who came to emergency rooms were in civilian clothing and their Hezbollah affiliation was unclear.[\[86\]](#cite_note-guardian_abiad-89)

Facial and eye injuries were the most common effect of the explosions and, according to [Tracy Chamoun](/wiki/Tracy_Chamoun "Tracy Chamoun")
, the pagers emitted a sound to encourage users to pick the devices up and lift them to their heads.[\[87\]](#cite_note-90)
 Other reports say that the device vibrated and showed an error message on the screen, and only detonated when the user pressed a button to clear the error, increasing the chance that the operator of the device would be holding it.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Associated_Press-21)
 Iranian ambassador to Lebanon [Mojtaba Amani](/wiki/Mojtaba_Amani "Mojtaba Amani")
, along with two additional embassy staffers, were injured in the attack.[\[3\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-3)
 Amani testified that a “special beep” sounded followed by the text, “You have an important message.” The detonation occurred on pushing a button to read it.[\[88\]](#cite_note-91)
 Amani lost one eye and suffered severe injuries in the other.[\[89\]](#cite_note-92)
[\[90\]](#cite_note-93)
 According to reports, the message that appeared on the pager was encrypted and required two buttons be simultaneously pressed, which in practice meant both hands had to be used to read the message.[\[91\]](#cite_note-Edelson-2024-10-06-94)

Explosions occurred in several areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence,[\[19\]](#cite_note-Associated_Press-21)
 including its stronghold of [Dahieh](/wiki/Dahieh "Dahieh")
 in [Beirut](/wiki/Beirut "Beirut")
; [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
; and the [Beqaa Valley](/wiki/Beqaa_Valley "Beqaa Valley")
 near the Syrian border,[\[38\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-41)
[\[15\]](#cite_note-BBC-17)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-3)
 where explosions were reported in the towns of [Aali en Nahri](/wiki/Aali_en_Nahri "Aali en Nahri")
 and [Riyaq](/wiki/Riyaq "Riyaq")
.[\[3\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-3)
 In Syria, explosions of pagers were also reported in [Damascus](/wiki/Damascus "Damascus")
 and its vicinity.[\[92\]](#cite_note-95)
[\[93\]](#cite_note-96)
 Blasts reportedly continued for up to 30 minutes after the initial detonations, intensifying the resulting chaos.[\[94\]](#cite_note-The_Jerusalem_Post-2-97)

Witnesses reported seeing multiple individuals with bleeding wounds in the aftermath of the blasts.[\[38\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-41)
 In one instance, an explosion occurred inside the trouser pockets of a man standing outside a shop.[\[95\]](#cite_note-98)
 Photos and videos circulating on social media and local media from Beirut's southern suburbs showed individuals lying on the ground with injuries on their hands or near their pockets.[\[96\]](#cite_note-99)

Around 150 hospitals received victims of the attack, which saw chaotic scenes.[\[23\]](#cite_note-France24-25)
[\[22\]](#cite_note-Al_Jazeera-3-24)
 Hospitals in southern Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley, and Beirut's southern suburbs were overwhelmed with patients, many suffering from injuries to the face, hands and waist.[\[97\]](#cite_note-BBC-2-100)
[\[98\]](#cite_note-101)
 In response, the Ministry of Health advised individuals with pagers to dispose of them and instructed hospitals to remain on "high alert".[\[3\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-3)
 It also called on health workers to report to work and asked them not to use wireless devices.[\[19\]](#cite_note-Associated_Press-21)
[\[27\]](#cite_note-CNN-2-29)
 The state-run [National News Agency](/wiki/National_News_Agency_(Lebanon) "National News Agency (Lebanon)")
 appealed for blood donations.[\[99\]](#cite_note-102)
 Ambulance crews were deployed from the northern cities of [Tripoli](/wiki/Tripoli,_Lebanon "Tripoli, Lebanon")
 and [Al-Qalamoun](/wiki/Al-Qalamoun "Al-Qalamoun")
 to help in Beirut.[\[27\]](#cite_note-CNN-2-29)

The attack came just a day after the [Biden administration](/wiki/Biden_administration "Biden administration")
's special envoy [Amos Hochstein](/wiki/Amos_Hochstein "Amos Hochstein")
 visited Israel and warned Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
 against provoking a major escalation in Lebanon.[\[100\]](#cite_note-Axios-103)
 Just before the blasts, Israeli defence minister [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
 told the US defense secretary [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
 that an operation was planned in Lebanon.[\[101\]](#cite_note-104)

### Day 2: exploding walkie-talkies

At around 17:00 EEST on 18 September, about 24 hours after the initial attack, a second wave of explosions occurred, targeting handheld radios.[\[102\]](#cite_note-BBC-ce9jglrnmkvo-105)
[\[103\]](#cite_note-106)

Explosions were reported in Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon.[\[104\]](#cite_note-107)
 The explosions also caused fires in at least two homes.[\[105\]](#cite_note-108)
 Other explosions occurred at a funeral held in Beirut for three Hezbollah members and a child who had been killed by the initial explosions.[\[106\]](#cite_note-109)
 [Lebanese Civil Defense](/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_Defense "Lebanese Civil Defense")
 said it responded to fires in at least 71 homes and shops,[\[107\]](#cite_note-:9-110)
 including a lithium battery store in [Majdel Selm](/wiki/Majdel_Selm "Majdel Selm")
, as well as 15 cars and numerous motorcycles. These fires were triggered by explosions in various locations across [Nabatieh Governorate](/wiki/Nabatieh_Governorate "Nabatieh Governorate")
.[\[108\]](#cite_note-lorientlejour-111)

One compromised device was discovered inside an ambulance outside the [American University of Beirut Medical Center](/wiki/American_University_of_Beirut#AUB_Medical_Center "American University of Beirut")
 (AUBMC) and neutralized in a [controlled explosion](/wiki/Controlled_explosion "Controlled explosion")
 by the [Lebanese Army](/wiki/Lebanese_Army "Lebanese Army")
.[\[109\]](#cite_note-112)
 Hezbollah supporters reportedly prevented journalists from filming the incident at the AUBMC.[\[108\]](#cite_note-lorientlejour-111)
[\[110\]](#cite_note-113)
 The [Lebanese Red Cross](/wiki/Lebanese_Red_Cross "Lebanese Red Cross")
 dispatched 30 ambulances to transport victims in the affected areas.[\[102\]](#cite_note-BBC-ce9jglrnmkvo-105)

The targeted devices were reported as [Icom](/wiki/Icom_Incorporated "Icom Incorporated")
 [IC-V82](/wiki/Icom_IC-V82 "Icom IC-V82")
 [VHF](/wiki/2-meter_band "2-meter band")
 [walkie-talkies](/wiki/Walkie-talkie "Walkie-talkie")
, known to be used by Hezbollah.[\[107\]](#cite_note-:9-110)
 Manufacture of the IC-V82 model ceased in 2014,[\[111\]](#cite_note-114)
 and Icom had previously issued an advisory warning about counterfeit radios, including the IC-V82.[\[112\]](#cite_note-115)
 The company said on 19 September that it was conducting an investigation[\[113\]](#cite_note-116)
 and, two days later, announced that it was "highly unlikely" that the radios were theirs.[\[114\]](#cite_note-117)
 A sales executive at Icom's US subsidiary said the transceivers involved appeared to be "knockoff" (counterfeit) products.[\[115\]](#cite_note-118)

Other electronic devices, such as [fingerprint biometric devices](/wiki/Biometric_device "Biometric device")
, were also reported to have exploded, though it remains unclear whether those devices caught fire from other explosions or detonated on their own.[\[116\]](#cite_note-week2-119)
[\[117\]](#cite_note-Marsi-120)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-The_Guardian-121)

In the aftermath of the second wave of explosions, a group of men attacked [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon](/wiki/United_Nations_Interim_Force_in_Lebanon "United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon")
 vehicles in [Tyre](/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon "Tyre, Lebanon")
, before Lebanese armed forces intervened.[\[119\]](#cite_note-122)
[\[120\]](#cite_note-123)

On 17 September Health Minister [Firass Abiad](/wiki/Firass_Abiad "Firass Abiad")
 said the vast majority of those being treated in emergency rooms were in civilian clothing and their Hezbollah affiliation was unclear,[\[125\]](#cite_note-128)
 but casualties included elderly people as well as young children. As of 18 September, it was unclear if only Hezbollah members were carrying the pagers.[\[126\]](#cite_note-ABC_News-129)
 During his speech on 19 September, Secretary-General Nasrallah clarified the exploded pagers were those distributed to lower ranking members while Hezbollah's leaders did not use the model.[\[127\]](#cite_note-:4-130)
 According to the Health Ministry, healthcare workers were also injured and it advised all healthcare workers to discard their pagers.[\[128\]](#cite_note-BBC-3-131)
[\[129\]](#cite_note-132)
 On 26 September, [Abdallah Bou Habib](/wiki/Abdallah_Bou_Habib "Abdallah Bou Habib")
, Lebanon's Foreign Minister, confirmed that most of those carrying pagers were not fighters, but civilians like administrators.[\[130\]](#cite_note-habib-133)
 Qassim Qassir, a Lebanese expert on Hezbollah,[\[d\]](#cite_note-fn1-134)
 said the attacks mostly struck civilian workers, leaving its military wing largely unaffected.[\[131\]](#cite_note-:13-135)
 On 11 November, [Mustafa Bairam](/w/index.php?title=Mustafa_Bairam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mustafa Bairam (page does not exist)")
 \[[ar](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%89_%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%85 "ar:مصطفى بيرم")\
; [de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Bayram "de:Mustafa Bayram")\

, made a formal complaint to the United Nations’ [International Labour Organization](/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization")
 (ILO), in which he stated that the pagers wounded or killed 4,000 civilians – much higher than initial reports of casualties.[\[13\]](#cite_note-:0-15)

One eye doctor at Mount Lebanon University Hospital reported that a number of those injured showed signs of something being blown up directly in their face, with some losing one or both eyes, while others had shrapnel in their brains.[\[132\]](#cite_note-136)
[\[133\]](#cite_note-137)
 The Lebanese health ministry reported that 300 people had lost both eyes and 500 people had lost one eye as a result of the pager attacks.[\[134\]](#cite_note-FR24_1-138)

### Lebanon

Lebanese health minister [Firas Abiad](/wiki/Firas_Abiad "Firas Abiad")
 said the scale of the attack was greater than the [2020 Beirut explosion](/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion "2020 Beirut explosion")
, which was one of the [largest artificial non-nuclear explosions](/wiki/Largest_artificial_non-nuclear_explosions "Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions")
 ever recorded.[\[138\]](#cite_note-142)
[\[139\]](#cite_note-143)
 The head of Lebanon's disaster response committee also compared the pager attack with the Beirut explosion, in terms of the sudden influx of casualties and the strain imposed on Lebanon's [emergency response](/wiki/Emergency_response "Emergency response")
 system.[\[140\]](#cite_note-144)
 Many Lebanese doctors who were treating the injured concurred that the level of injuries was greater than that after the port explosion.[\[141\]](#cite_note-145)

#### Hezbollah

[CNN](/wiki/CNN "CNN")

 [John Miller](/wiki/John_Miller_(police_official) "John Miller (police official)")

_[The Economist](/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")
_ suggested that the pager-bombs, aimed at disrupting Hezbollah's command and communications structure, could be a precursor to an Israeli invasion. He argued that the loss or damage to a small number of civilians was not excessive in relation to the military advantage of removing many Hezbollah operatives from the battlefield and destroying the organization's trust in their communications.[\[177\]](#cite_note-bergin-181)
 Former Australian Minister for Defence Materiel [Mike Kelly](/wiki/Mike_Kelly_(Australian_politician) "Mike Kelly (Australian politician)")

### Lebanon

A senior Lebanese security source told _[Al-Hadath](/wiki/Al-Hadath "Al-Hadath")
_ that Israel had infiltrated the communication systems of individual devices, leading to their detonation.[\[94\]](#cite_note-The_Jerusalem_Post-2-97)

On 6 November 2024, Lebanon filed a complaint against Israel in the [International Labour Organization](/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization")
 (ILO) over the attacks, with labour minister [Mustafa Bairam](/w/index.php?title=Mustafa_Bairam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mustafa Bairam (page does not exist)")

 Those close to the group described a state of shock following the explosions.[\[64\]](#cite_note-The_Economist-67)
 Lebanese analyst Qassim Qassir said the attacks mostly struck civilian workers within Hezbollah, and not fighters.[\[131\]](#cite_note-:13-135)

Eight days before [his assassination on 27 September 2024](/wiki/2024_Hezbollah_headquarters_strike "2024 Hezbollah headquarters strike")

 He added that Israel had crossed all "red lines".[\[182\]](#cite_note-186)
 Nasrallah challenged the IDF to invade Lebanon, claiming Hezbollah was ready, and said that Israelis displaced in the north would only be allowed to return if Israel ceased the invasion of Gaza.[\[183\]](#cite_note-187)

On the morning of 22 September, Hezbollah retaliated by firing dozens of rockets at northern Israel.[\[184\]](#cite_note-:7-188)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the attacks in Lebanon in September 2024 involved explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, not iPhones. The image shows an iPhone, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it exploded during the attacks. The attacks targeted Hezbollah members, and the claim states that random people were blown up.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.

In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10226> This image shows an Iphone that exploded during the pager attacks on Hezbollah devices in Lebanon in September 2024, blowing up random people."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:10226>)
web_search("Hezbollah Lebanon September 2024 phone explosion")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10226>

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the 2024 Lebanon electronic device attacks, which occurred in September 2024. The attacks involved explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, resulting in numerous casualties. The attacks were attributed to Israel and targeted Hezbollah members. The first wave of explosions on September 17, 2024, targeted pagers, killing at least 12 people and injuring over 2,750. The second wave on September 18, 2024, targeted walkie-talkies, killing at least 30 people and injuring over 750.

One source mentions that <image:10226>

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the attacks in Lebanon in September 2024 involved explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies, not iPhones. The image shows an iPhone, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it exploded during the attacks. The attacks targeted Hezbollah members, and the claim states that random people were blown up.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Source of the claim

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

**GAZA, 25 June 2024 –** Up to 21,000 \[1\] children are estimated to be missing in the chaos of the war in Gaza, many trapped beneath rubble, detained, buried in unmarked graves, or lost from their families, said Save the Children. The agency’s child protection teams are reporting that the latest displacements caused by the offensive in Rafah have separated more children and further increased the strain on families and communities caring for them.

It is nearly impossible to collect and verify information under the current conditions in Gaza, but at least 17,000 children are believed to [be unaccompanied and separated](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/stories-loss-and-grief-least-17000-children-are-estimated-be-unaccompanied-or)
 and approximately 4,000 children are likely missing under the rubble \[2\], with an unknown number also in [mass graves](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/onslaught-violence-against-women-and-children-gaza-unacceptable-un-experts#:~:text=Over%20390%20bodies%20have%20been,alive%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20experts%20said)
. Save the Children added these estimates to equal approximately 21,000 children missing in Gaza, or over 20,000.

\[2\] The UN estimates that [10,000 people](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/05/1149256)
 are believed buried under the rubble in Gaza, and also estimates that [40% of casualties](https://www.unocha.org/news/gaza-children-under-attack)
 in Gaza are children. Save the Children estimates this would amount to approximately 4,000 children buried under the rubble in Gaza.

\[3\] According to latest figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than 14,100 children have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, of which 7,779 have been identified. Others have been forcibly disappeared, including an unknown number [detained and forcibly transferred](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/israelopt-un-experts-appalled-reported-human-rights-violations-against)
 out of Gaza, their whereabouts unknown to their families amidst [reports of ill-treatment and torture.](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/summary_on_detention_and_alleged_ill-treatmentupdated.pdf)

Meanwhile, the aid agency’s child protection teams warn of the urgent action needed to protect separated and unaccompanied children – action that is severely undermined by the deteriorating security situation.

**A Save the Children Child Protection Specialist in Gaza said:**

_"Every day we find more unaccompanied children and every day it is harder to support them. Children are also among those recently found in mass graves, [according to UN experts](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/onslaught-violence-against-women-and-children-gaza-unacceptable-un-experts#:~:text=Over%20390%20bodies%20have%20been,alive%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20experts%20said.)
, with many showing signs of torture and summary executions, as well as potential [instances of people buried alive](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/onslaught-violence-against-women-and-children-gaza-unacceptable-un-experts#:~:text=Over%20390%20bodies%20have%20been,alive%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20experts%20said)
.

At least 33 Israeli children have been killed since October, while it is unclear if any children are among those still being held hostage in Gaza. This includes [17,000 unaccompanied and separated children](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/stories-loss-and-grief-least-17000-children-are-estimated-be-unaccompanied-or)
, and 4,000 children buried under the rubble \[see 2 below\]. We work through partners to identify separated and unaccompanied children and trace their families, but there are no safe facilities for them – there is no safe place in Gaza. Save the Children warned that confirming identification of a body by the next of kin is almost impossible when whole families have been wiped out and entry restrictions mean the equipment and experts needed cannot get in.

According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, [more than 14,000 children](https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/children-gaza-need-lifesaving-support#:~:text=More%20than%2014%2C000%20children%20have,which%20will%20last%20a%20lifetime.)
 have been killed since 7 October, roughly half of whom have not yet been fully identified, partially due to their bodies being harmed beyond recognition \[3\]. No child should be detained or held hostage._

_“Children who are missing but living are vulnerable, face grave protection risks and must be found."

At the same time, the unrelenting intensity of the war in Gaza, movement and access restrictions, and communication blackouts have made it difficult to keep track of and locate children who have been separated and detained. 

This means that the true number of missing children in Gaza is even higher.

Thousands are presumed dead beneath the rubble. Their condition is unknown, and their loved ones are living with the uncertainty of not knowing if their children are alive.

**How many children are missing?**
----------------------------------

### **We can’t be sure.**

At least **10,000 people are reported missing** under the rubble, presumed dead. Children are reported to make up 43% of total casualties in this devastating war.

#### So, it’s reasonable to estimate that at least **5,160 children are dead** under the rubble. This number is likely much higher now, with our team in Gaza finding more unaccompanied children every day. 

Furthermore, the bodies of children have been among those recently found in [mass graves](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/onslaught-violence-against-women-and-children-gaza-unacceptable-un-experts#:~:text=Over%20390%20bodies%20have%20been,alive%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20experts%20said.)
 with many showing signs of torture.

The UN has also raised the alarm about the mass detention of possibly thousands of people, including children, reporting cases of ill-treatment in detention by Israeli forces.

The ongoing violence in Gaza has disrupted communications, and the attacks on hospitals have made it extremely difficult for medical staff to report death tolls and identify those killed. Photo: Bisan Owda / Save the Children.

A child's doll amongst the rubble in Gaza. **Children aren’t likely to survive being crushed by entire apartment buildings.** 

### **2.** **Maimed beyond recognition**

Children – who are [seven times more likely](https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/worlds-first-research-centre-child-blast-injuries)
 to die from blast injuries than adults due to their still developing and vulnerable bodies – have suffered such horrific injuries from bombs and collapsed buildings that their bodies are beyond recognition.

Added to that, forensic and human rights experts can’t enter Gaza and even if they could, wouldn’t have the safety or the resources they need to identify children’s remains. 

### **3.** **Mass graves**  

Palestinian authorities and [UN experts](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/05/onslaught-violence-against-women-and-children-gaza-unacceptable-un-experts#:~:text=Over%20390%20bodies%20have%20been,alive%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20experts%20said.))
 have found mass graves in and around hospitals throughout Gaza, with hundreds of bodies, including children.  

The spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [described](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148876)
 bodies _“buried deep in the ground and covered with waste_”, and that some were bound and stripped of their clothes. 

### **4\.** **Detained, "disappeared" or abducted**

Up to 3,000 people have been [detained in Gaza](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/summary_on_detention_and_alleged_ill-treatmentupdated.pdf)
 including an unknown number of children."

Crying for mum
--------------

Like Ahmed, Muna Alwan is also a war orphan and was described as WCNSF when she arrived at the Indonesian Hospital.

The two-year-old constantly cries "Mama", but her mum is dead.

Muna was pulled from under the rubble after an air strike hit a neighbour's house in the Jabal al-Rais area of northern Gaza. <image:11655>!Mahmoud Aki Three-year-old Ahmed Shabat in hospital <image:11656>Mahmoud Aki

Three-year-old Ahmed Shabat lost his legs in an explosion in Gaza

**Medics working in the Gaza Strip are using a specific phrase to describe a particular kind of war victim.**

"There's an acronym that's unique to the Gaza Strip, it's WCNSF - wounded child, no surviving family - and it's not used infrequently," Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan who works with Doctors Without Borders told BBC News.

The expression captures the horror of the situation for many Gazan children. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the conflict, including about 6,000 children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

Ahmed Shabat is one of those children who was described as a wounded child, with no surviving family, when he arrived injured and crying at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. He was crawling towards me, opening his arms, seeking help." A family member, who was with Ahmed at the time of the blast, was killed.

Ibrahim, who is still displaced with his own family as well as his sister's children, says he dreams of being able to send Ahmed for treatment outside Gaza.

"He wanted to be many things," his uncle said sadly. I want to get a prosthetic leg, travel, become a doctor, and for this war to end and our children to live in peace.'"

Determining the precise number of orphaned children in the Gaza Strip is challenging given the "intensity of hostilities and rapidly evolving situation on the ground", according to Ricardo Pires, the communication manager at the UN children's fund Unicef.

Mr Pires adds that the organisation attempted to reach hospitals and health staff in Gaza to identify and register children, but "these efforts are proceeding very slowly due to the extremely challenging conditions".

He explained not only was it "almost impossible" to identify safe, temporary care arrangements due to "chaotic and overcrowded" shelters and hospitals, but "the normal system to identify document, trace and reunite children with relatives is barely functional".

Ahmed and Omar were now orphans, homeless, with no shelter to protect them from continuous shelling, so Ibrahim decided to look after them, along with his own family. <image:11655>!Mohammed Al-Kahlout  Muna Alwan <image:11658>Mohammed Al-Kahlout

Two-year-old Muna Alwan lost her parents, brother and grandfather in an airstrike in northern Gaza

Muna was transferred to another hospital where she was tracked down by her aunt Hanaa.

"We knew through the internet that Muna was at Nasser Hospital. But she says her niece is suffering terribly.

"She just wants to scream, always afraid, especially if someone approaches her," Hanaa adds.

Muna does have older sisters who are alive but they are in Gaza City.

"They are stuck and there is no way to bring them to the south," Hanaa says, adding: "I constantly ask myself, what will we do? How do we compensate for her mother?"

'I lost my leg and my family'
-----------------------------

On a metal bed in the corner of a room at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, 11-year-old Dunya Abu Mehsen looks at what remains of her right leg wrapped in white bandages.

The girl, with long curly hair, sits at the edge of the bed, wearing a velvety red dress, silent most of the time, appearing deeply sad.

Dunya survived an air strike with her brother, Yusuf, and her younger sister that hit when they were all sleeping at their home in the al-Amal neighbourhood in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza.

But her parents, brother and sister were killed."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is of mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The reverse image search confirms this, citing an article that identifies the image's origin. The web search provides information about the situation of children in Gaza, but it does not relate to the image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim is false.

Cease-fire in Lebanon and Gaza\
------------------------------](/portfolio/927-hamas-israel-war)

After the Israeli strike of Wednesday night on a small building in Nabatieh, residents woke up in disbelief at what happened, according to testimonies given to L'Orient Today's correspondent in the area.

The Israeli air force targeted the western part of the city, amid the daily and escalating exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and the Israeli army along the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At least two missiles were fired at the two- or three-story building, according to security sources, residents, and rescuers whose testimonies were collected by our correspondent in the region.

On Thursday morning, Hussein Faqih, Head of the Civil Defence Centre in the Nabatieh Regional Centre, told L'Orient Today that the rescue operations in the destroyed building were concluded and that nine people suffered from injuries he qualified as "medium to light."

Others suffered from smoke inhalation caused by the explosions and loss of consciousness, according to Faqih.

The Civil Defense was deployed on-site, along with the Red Cross, al-Rissala scouts (affiliated with the Amal movement), and the Islamic Health Committee (affiliated with Hezbollah).

The building, located on an intersection in the northwestern area of Nabatieh called Hay al-Bayad, was completely destroyed, Faqih added, explaining that "dozens of close-by houses have been damaged, as well as dozens of cars."

According to our correspondent, Nabatieh had previously been targeted by drones, but never by the Israeli air force, which had, until now, targeted only the city’s outskirts.

Speaking to L'Orient Today, Iqbal Marwa, a supermarket owner in her fifties from the Al-Bayad neighborhood, said the balcony railings and doors in her house, just a few hundred meters from the airstrike, were shaking from the impact.

"I was on my balcony drinking coffee when I heard the sound of a missile being launched. Immediately after, I heard a huge explosion. Screams rose from the neighboring houses, and people went out onto their balconies, wondering where the explosion had occurred," she said.

"I did not expect my city to be bombed in this way. To be honest, I did not expect my house to be in the danger zone, yet I was not afraid," she said, ensuring that she intends to "stay in my home."

She explained she went to the site of the strike this morning and was "shocked by the extent of the destruction."

Faten Sabah, who was also close to the airstrike, told L'Orient Today that when she heard the sound of the fighter jets and "a sonic boom," she "took cover in a corner of the room and asked my daughter to take cover as well, fearing the windows would shatter."

"As soon as I said that, a massive explosion echoed for a few seconds, shaking the walls and doors."

"I will not leave my house because of one raid, and neither will my neighbors. This is what they said this morning. We agreed not to leave our homes and to monitor how the situation develops," Sabah said. She added sarcastically, "Where would we go with our pockets empty of money?"

In mid-February, notably, seven civilians from the same family were killed in a drone strike in Nabatieh. The Israeli army said the attack was conducted in retaliation for unclaimed rocket fire from Lebanon that hit a military base in northern Israel and killed one soldier.

 members of his coalition to resume war against the Gaza Strip.[\[28\]](#cite_note-PBS20250318-28)

 in Gaza.[\[45\]](#cite_note-46)

Netanyahu's critics have said that the 18 March attacks are a result of Netanyahu's legal troubles.[\[14\]](#cite_note-BBC20250318-14)

 Trump proposed that Gaza's 2 million Palestinians be permanently relocated from the Strip.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)
 This plan was supported by Netanyahu but condemned by human rights experts as a violation of international law.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)
 The 18 March attacks were done with Trump's approval.[\[48\]](#cite_note-Yahoo20250318-49)

Journalists among 20 Palestinians killed in Israeli strike on Gaza hospital – video

Israel bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officials
=================================================================================

At least 20 people, including five journalists, died as they rushed to help those wounded in the first strike

Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.

The first strike hit the top floor of a building at the Nasser hospital, killing the [Reuters](https://www.theguardian.com/media/reuters)
 journalist Hussam al-Masri and others. We need an immediate ceasefire,” Lammy wrote on X.

The US president, Donald Trump, told reporters: “I’m not happy about it,” when asked about the attack, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as “intolerable”.

Meanwhile, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel deeply regretted what he described as a “tragic mishap” at the Nasser hospital.

Israel has regularly struck hospitals, claiming without evidence that Hamas uses them for military purposes. A [report](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/02/idf-no-fault-conclusion-alleged-war-abuse-cases-report)
 published this month showed that 88% of investigations into war crimes allegations in Gaza were shut down or left unresolved. She left behind a letter for her 13-year-old son, Ghaith, telling him: “Make me proud … become successful and excel.”

Abu Aziz was based in the Nasser hospital, where he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. Israel launched its assault after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.

UN staff member killed in central Gaza blast, five others injured
=================================================================

19 March 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

At least one UN staffer has been killed and at least five others injured – several very severely – following an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday.

The UN is verifying and confirming the details, including the circumstances that led up to the incident at the compound,, but **it was not due to “any action” that was being taken by UN personnel to remove “unexploded ordinance”**, the head of the [UN Office for Project Services](https://www.unops.org/)
 (UNOPS) [said](https://www.unops.org/news-and-stories/speeches/statement-on-unops-colleague-killed-at-unops-premises-in-gaza)
 during a press conference in Brussels.

According to media reports, the Israeli military – which has resumed deadly strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds since Monday – has denied attacking the compound.

“**These premises were well known by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and they were ‘deconflicted’**,” said, UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva, explaining that “**everyone knew who was working inside the premises – it was UN personnel, UNOPS personnel**.”

No accident
-----------

“This was not an accident, this was an incident,” he told journalists, adding that additional information is being collected.

“**What we do know is that an explosive ordnance was dropped or fired at the infrastructure and detonated inside the building**,” he said, adding it was unclear if it had been due to air-drop weapons, artillery or rocket fire.

Mr. da Silva said.

The UN buildings are situated in an “isolated area” in Dier al Balah.

Evacuating the injured
----------------------

As investigations continue into the incident, the “top priority” is the evacuation of injured staff members, Mr. Their efforts include delivering essential supplies such as fuel and assisting in demining and explosive removal.

Additionally, the agency manages the so-called UN 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, which was [mandated](https://docs.un.org/en/s/res/2720(2023))
 by the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 to accelerate humanitarian aid into the enclave.

UN chief condemns attacks
-------------------------

Tweet URL

> [](https://twitter.com/UN_News_Centre/statuses/1902461210311930291)

[Secretary-General António Guterres](https://www.un.org/sg/)
 reaffirmed that all parties to the conflict have a legal obligation to protect UN premises, which must remain absolutely inviolable.

In a [statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2025-03-19/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-gaza)
 issued by his spokesperson, the UN chief strongly condemned the attacks and called for a full investigation.

“**Today’s deadly strike brings the number of UN colleagues killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023 to at least 280**,” the statement noted.

Mr. The hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally,” said the statement.

 Print [Email](mailto:?subject=UN staff member killed in central Gaza blast, five others injured&body=https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261 "Share this via Email") da Silva stressed that attacks against humanitarian premises are a breach of international law.  

“UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides. **The civilian population relies on the UN for lifesaving assistance, they are an essential lifeline at the time of utter tragedy and devastation**,” he said.

Previous attacks
----------------

The incident took place at around 11:30 AM local time on Wednesday. da Silva said.

“We have stayed and delivered for the people in Gaza in the last year and a half. This was not the first time a first colleague from UNOPS lost their life,” he added, noting that a staffer who drove aid trucks was killed around a year ago in the line of duty.

“**It is very difficult to operate in Gaza…we have been challenged by the fact that international humanitarian law has not been respected**,” he said.

UNOPS teams in Gaza have been carrying out critical humanitarian work, supporting hundreds of thousands of civilians severely affected by the conflict. Guterres emphasised that all military operations must respect and prioritise civilian protection.

“**The Secretary-General stresses the need for the ceasefire to be respected to bring an end to the suffering of the people**."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The reverse image search indicates that the image was taken in Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not in Deir al-Balah in March 2025. The geolocation data suggests Palestine as a possible location, but the reverse image search contradicts this. The web search confirms that there were attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but the provided image is not related to those events.

Therefore, the claim is false.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip)) discusses the March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which targeted multiple locations, including Deir al-Balah, and resulted in over 591 deaths. The UN News article ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261)) reports that an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al-Balah killed at least one UN staff member and injured five others. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital)) reported on an Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. <image:10234>, <image:11679>, <image:11690>, <image:11691>, <image:11692>, <image:11693>.


## Elaboration
The reverse image search indicates that the image was taken in Nabatieh, South Lebanon, on June 26, 2024, and not in Deir al-Balah in March 2025. The geolocation data suggests Palestine as a possible location, but the reverse image search contradicts this. The web search confirms that there were attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but the provided image is not related to those events.

Therefore, the claim is false.

اقتحامات واعتداءات إسرائيلية متواصلة في الضفة الغربية

**تبدأ قوات الاحتلال الإسرائيلي صباح اليوم حملتها الهمجية ضد مدن الضفة الغربية وتقتحم المنازل والمباني في مشهد يرسم صورة من صور القمع الوحشي لشعب يطالب بحريته ويواجه آلة الحرب بلا رحمة تشن حملات اعتقال غير مسبوقة ضد المدنيين الأبرياء وتقتحم الأماكن السكنية لتختطف الرجال والنساء من وسط عائلاتهم وتترك وراءها مشاهد مأساوية تعكس مدى تصعيد الهجوم العسكري الإسرائيلي في المنطقة**

تستمر العملية العسكرية المروعة في المدن الفلسطينية حيث لا يقتصر الهجوم على الاعتقالات فحسب بل يشمل أيضاً عمليات دهم غير قانونية لمنازل السكان المحليين وتدمير ممتلكاتهم واحتجازهم تحت تهديد السلاح ولا تكاد تخلُ منطقة في الضفة الغربية من الاقتحامات التي لا تفرق بين كبير وصغير، نساء وأطفال يعانون من الهلع بينما يشهدون كيف تقتحم القوات الإسرائيلية منازلهم بعنف وتخطف من في داخلها وتقتادهم إلى أماكن مجهولة تحت تهديد القتل والتعذيب

تستمر الانتهاكات الإسرائيلية دون توقف في ظل صمت دولي مريب وتشهد الضفة الغربية موجة من الخوف والرعب بعد أن فاق عنف الاحتلال كل الحدود في ظل انعدام أي تحرك جاد من المجتمع الدولي لوقف هذه الحملة العسكرية الغاشمة وفي الوقت نفسه يستمر المواطنون في مقاومة الاحتلال بكل ما أوتوا من قوة رغم قسوة الظروف واستمرار الاعتقالات الجماعية التي تطال كل شرائح المجتمع الفلسطيني بما في ذلك الأطفال والشيوخ

الحكومة الإسرائيلية تواصل سياسة الاعتقالات كأسلوب قمعي وتستخدمها للضغط على الشعب الفلسطيني لتحقيق مكاسب سياسية بينما يظل الفلسطينيون في قلب معركة شرسة من أجل نيل حقوقهم وكرامتهم في مواجهة ظلم لا يعرف الحدود ولا يتوقف عن سلب أرواحهم وأرضهم وآمالهم في تحقيق السلام المنشود في ظل ظروف غاية في الصعوبة والتعقيد.

Content: "Two crudely launched artillery rockets were launched from a rural area outside Tasil in western Daraa, traversing approximately 10km and landing inside Israeli territory, where they landed in open territory. Then came three rounds of Israeli airstrikes, hitting targets including the 175th Brigade base near Izraa, Daraa; the 121st Brigade, near Kanaker in Rif Dimashq; and Dahr al-Aswad, near Saasaa in Rif Dimashq. A small convoy of armored vehicles also reinforced the IDF’s forward operating base in Ma’ariyah in western Daraa.

According to local media today, several individuals were killed and others injured during a clash with the Israeli army in western rural Daraa, southern Syria.

The SANA news agency stated that "at least 11 people were killed, and 27 others were injured," adding that Israeli forces withdrew after hours of incursion around the city of Nawa, the town of Al-Jubayliyah, and its dam in rural Daraa, retreating toward the Tel Ahmar base.

In this context, Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said: "During the past night, forces from the 474th Golan Brigade operated in the Tasil area in southern Syria, seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure."

He added: "During the operation, several armed individuals opened fire at our forces operating in the area, prompting them to respond and eliminate several armed terrorists through ground and air strikes. The Israel Defense Forces will not allow a military threat inside Syria and will act against it."

The Israeli attack comes after airstrikes carried out by Israeli fighter jets during the night on the Scientific Research Center building in the Masaken Barzeh district of Damascus, as well as targeting Hama Military Airport and the Tiyas (T4) Airbase east of Homs.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Damascus authority stated in a statement that "the Israeli attack resulted in the near-total destruction of Hama Military Airport and the injury of dozens of civilians and military personnel."

Authorities in the southern province of Daraa said nine civilians were killed and several wounded in Israeli shelling near the city of Nawa.

The provincial government said the bombardment came amid Israel's deepest ground incursion into southern Syria so far.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the dead were local gunmen who were killed "while attempting to confront Israeli forces, following calls by the mosques in the area for jihad against the Israeli incursion".

According to the Israeli military, its forces were conducting operations in the Tasil area, near Nawa, "seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure" when "several gunmen fired at our forces".

They "responded by firing at them and eliminated several armed terrorists from the ground and from the air", a spokesperson said. The onslaught on military targets and in the southern province of Daraa killed at least 13 people.

Syria accuses Israel of stoking a deadly destabilisation campaign
=================================================================

Middle East

Syria on Thursday condemned deadly Israeli strikes across the country as a "flagrant violation" of its sovereignty, after Israel said it struck "military capabilities". © Abdulaziz Ketaz, AFP

[Syria](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/syria/)
 accused [Israel](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/israel/)
 on Thursday of mounting a deadly destabilisation campaign after a wave of strikes hit military targets, including an airport, and ground incursions left 13 people dead. 

Israel said it responded to fire from gunmen during an operation in southern Syria and warned interim President [Ahmed al-Sharaa](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/abu-mohammed-al-jolani/)
 that he would face severe consequences if its security was threatened.

Israel has carried out an extensive bombing campaign against Syrian military assets since Islamist-led rebels toppled longtime strongman [Bashar al-Assad](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/bashar-al-assad/)
 in November. There were no Israeli casualties.

"The IDF (military) will not allow the existence of a military threat in Syria and will act against it," the spokesperson added.

Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/benjamin-netanyahu/)
 demanded in February that southern Syria be completely demilitarised and said his government would not accept the presence of the forces of the new Islamist-led government near Israeli territory.

In December, Netanyahu ordered troops to enter the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces along the 1974 armistice line on the [Golan Heights](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/golan-heights/)
.

'Unjustified escalation'
------------------------

On Wednesday, Israel hit targets across Syria including in the [Damascus](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/damascus/)
 area.

The Syrian foreign ministry said the strikes resulted in the "near-total destruction" of a military airport in the central province of Hama and wounded dozens of civilians and soldiers.

"This unjustified escalation is a deliberate attempt to destabilise Syria and exacerbate the suffering of its people," it said in a statement on Telegram.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz hit back with a warning to Sharaa in which he pointedly referred to the president by the nom de guerre he used as an Islamist rebel commander.

"I warn Syrian leader Jolani: If you allow hostile forces to enter Syria and threaten Israeli security interests, you will pay a heavy price," he said.

"The air force's activity yesterday near the airports in T4, Hama and the Damascus area sends a clear message and serves as a warning for the future," he added.

Read more[Israel strikes military targets in southern Syria over national security concerns](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250317-israel-southern-syria)

The Israeli military said its forces "struck military capabilities that remained at the Syrian bases of Hama and T4, along with additional remaining military infrastructure sites in the area of Damascus".

Israel has said it wants to prevent advanced weapons from falling into the hands of the new authorities, whom it considers jihadists.

Sharaa fought for Al-Qaeda in Iraq after the US-led invasion of 2003 and later set up a Syrian branch of the jihadist network before breaking off all ties.

The Syrian ministry said the Israeli strikes came as the country was trying to rebuild after 14 years of war, calling it a strategy to "normalise violence within the country".

During a visit to [Jerusalem](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jerusalem/)
 last month, EU foreign policy chief [Kaja Kallas](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/kaja-kallas/)
 said that Israeli strikes on Syria were "unnecessary" and risked worsening the situation.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil in February 2025 is not supported by the evidence. Reverse image searches show the image has been used in articles from 2018, 2021, and January 2025, predating the February 2025 date in the claim.

Web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including Tasil. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the exact date or the specific context of the image.

The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel, which aligns with the presence of Israeli military forces. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's location as Tasil.

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

### ABANDONED TANK BECAME A FRUIT STAND

On the other hand, an abandoned tank by regime forces became a fruit stand. The image showed various fruits and vegetables being sold on the tank's surface.

The vegetable basket that once fed Gaza
=======================================

Israel has bulldozed the fertile area of Mirage, destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself and sentencing the people to a slow death.

In southern Gaza, just outside Rafah, lies Mirage—once known as the vegetable basket of Gaza. Then the tanks rolled in, trampling the land to ensure that it would no longer be suitable for agriculture.

Since March 2, 2025, almost no food or aid has entered Gaza, and people cannot find anything to eat. “Not because there’s no sun—but because there’s no reason to water what’s no longer alive.”

The Israeli assault on Mirage came not only with bulldozers grinding through the earth and drones buzzing menacingly overhead, but with the brutal understanding that destroying Gaza’s ability to feed itself sentences it to a slow death.

Abu Suleiman’s eyes welled up as he remembered the tomatoes he grew that fed Gaza. Will we ever be free to make this land fertile again, or will the dust remain as a permanent reminder of what was lost?

_Vegetables from the market in January 2025, the last time they were readily available and affordable. This fertile area yielded vibrant red tomatoes, the earthy scent of freshly dug potatoes, the glossy purple of plump eggplants, and the sharp, clean smell of onions to homes across the besieged Gaza Strip.

Mirage now lies barren. Israel destroyed everything: the land, the homes, even the vegetables."

Nicole Hark Mercy Corps Country Director for Palestine

Gaza’s economy has collapsed under the weight of conflict and blockade, with food prices soaring up to 7,000% since October 2023. Over 95% of families face severe financial hardship, and availability of any household goods, let alone food or fresh vegetables, is nearly nonexistent.

People survive on beans and dry chickpeas, with reports of dizziness and fainting in the streets from lack of food and water. As the Mercy Corps Country Director in Palestine, I’ve witnessed the devastation first-hand on a recent visit to central Gaza.

  ![Street scene -- destroyed buildings -- in gaza.](/sites/default/files/styles/image_caption_bottom_resizable_small_1x/public/2025-08/palestine-20250626-nhark-145235.jpg?h=e6b46478&itok=MmXTSVvI)

In Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, buildings in ruins stretch on for blocks at a time dotted by makeshift shelters.

Despite severe restrictions, Mercy Corps and local partners have reached over 350,000 people in Gaza since October 2023 with food, hygiene and shelter kits, water distributions and cash assistance. We’re adapting to the aid blockade by providing cash through mobile codes and e-wallets, offering psychosocial support to help adults and children cope with the mental toll of the conflict, and expanding water trucking and latrine installation to help stem the tide of dehydration and disease.

  ![Water tender truck parked in gaza street.](/sites/default/files/styles/diptych_small_1x/public/2025-08/palestine-20250819-mercycorps-5701.jpg?h=c041566c&itok=pdDsma9N)

Water trucks carry large barrels fitted with spigots, one barrel provides water for one site’s needs.

  ![Palestine filling up jerrycans of water from truck parked in gaza street.](/sites/default/files/styles/diptych_small_1x/public/2025-08/palestine-20250819-mercycorps-5708.jpg?h=4dc51d14&itok=1suA2E9A)

People gather at water distribution sites with any containers they have on hand to collect water for their households.

Since June, Mercy Corps has been working with local partner organization, Palestine Environmental Friends, to deliver clean water to households living in camps for displaced people. As a mother of three small children, I saw these kids and thought they should be in school or on a playground—anywhere other than collecting water for their families.

  ![Palestinians filling jerrycans from water tender truck.](/sites/default/files/styles/image_caption_bottom_resizable_small_1x/public/2025-08/palestine-20250819-mercycorps-5715.jpg?h=d1372364&itok=GEt3RgEi)

Daily water truck deliveries are critical since much of the water and sanitation infrastructure in central Gaza has been destroyed.

Every day in central Gaza, Mercy Corps is delivering clean water to an average of 800 households (approximately 4,000 individuals) in Deir al-Balah. But the scale of need far outpaces what little we can provide, due to limited funding and restrictions to bring in additional goods.

Over half a million people in Gaza are already living through famine—facing hunger, desperation, and preventable deaths, according to a new report from IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification), a leading agency analyzing food security. And in the coming weeks, famine conditions are expected to spread beyond Gaza City into Deir Al Balah and Khan Younis. Without this, millions more will continue to face starvation and disease in Gaza.

Help bring emergency aid to families in Gaza and around the world.

Content: "International kids standing in front of tanks with banners. There is a great deal of concern here about the “reoccupation of Gaza.” Gaza is reoccupied every day to various extents but I think the fear is that the tanks will enter all the streets and remain here instead of entering some of the streets and then withdrawing after some hours or days to observe and shoot from the edges of the communities. I was really scared that they were all going to be shot and I tried to stand between them and the tank. Nowhere in Rachel Corrie’s letters does she use the word “courage.” Yet at one point in her letters, she describes that “I tried to stand between them \[Palestinians\] and the tank.” What are the experiences in Corrie’s life that might lead to this kind of courageous response?

I don’t know if many of the children here have ever existed without tank-shell holes in their walls and the towers of an occupying army surveying them constantly from the near horizons. I think, although I’m not entirely sure, that even the smallest of these children understand that life is not like this everywhere. An 8-year-old was shot and killed by an Israeli tank two days before I got here, and many of the children murmur his name to me — Ali — or point at the posters of him on the walls. Go!” because a tank was coming."

Some Merkava tanks are fitted with full medical and ambulance abilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the standard tank, having both ammunition racks in the rear removed). The Loader Keyboard Panel (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local activation of the trays.

The main operational roles are: firing from internal storage; firing for elevator – ground-piled ammunition; loading from elevator – external pile; synthesising fire programs; unloading; manual firing; identification; and fusing and checks.

Standard equipment includes an NBC system of the overpressure type and an inertial navigation and aiming system designed for autonomous operations.

According to Soltam Systems, the 155 mm/52 caliber ordnance and automatic loader, or parts of the system, could be installed in other self-propelled artillery systems and used to upgrade other self-propelled systems such as the US-designed and built 155 mm [M109](/wiki/M109_howitzer "M109 howitzer")

 Four main variants have been deployed. The name "Merkava" was derived from the IDF's initial development program name.

The tank was developed in the Merkava and Armored Combat Vehicles Division of the [Israeli Ministry of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
, and most of its parts are manufactured in Israel. The Merkava was designed to provide maximum protection for its crew, and therefore its front armor was fortified and the engine placed in the front part of the tank, unlike most other tanks.

Design criteria include rapid repair of battle damage, survivability, cost-effectiveness, and off-road performance. This allows the tank to be used as a platform for medical disembarkation (with no ammunition, the Merkava can hold up to 4 stretchers, but this is only an emergency measure), a forward command and control station, and an [infantry fighting vehicle](/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicle "Infantry fighting vehicle")

From [Source](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/israels-merkava-tank-armored-juggernaut-214399/): 
Content: "The IDF’s [Merkava series](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/)
 of main battle tanks (MBT), widely considered to be among the most lethal armored vehicles in service across the globe, has remained the centerpiece of Israel’s armored corps for more than four decades.

**Introducing the Merkava series of MBTs**
------------------------------------------

The Merkava family of tanks can be traced back to the 1960s when Israel’s journey to developing its own homegrown MBT series originated. However, this agreement ultimately fell through, prompting Israel to [develop](https://armyrecognition.com/military-products/army/main-battle-tanks/main-battle-tanks/merkava-iv-4-israel-uk)
 its own program. The Merkava incorporates other new technologies that make it a top-tier [platform](https://www.timesofisrael.com/advanced-sensors-high-tech-helmet-israels-5th-generation-battle-tank-revealed/)
. According to Elbit Systems, the Merkava’s manufacturer, the helmet displays information about ongoing fighting to operators and “generates an image that enables the crew to ‘see through’ the vehicle’s armor.”

**The Merkava keeps improving**
-------------------------------

Over the years, several new Merkava iterations have been [introduced](https://www.twz.com/israeli-merkava-tanks-appear-with-cope-cage-armor)
 in order for the tank series to retain an edge over its competitors. Notably, this homegrown system improves the tank’s ability to target enemy MBTs and therefore increases the crew’s survivability.

The IDF introduced its fifth-generation [“Barak” variant](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/merkava-israels-powerful-tank-no-army-can-match-battlefield-208925)
 in 2023, which is decked out with even more sophisticated components. The IDF detailed that these tanks will “strengthen the capabilities of detecting enemies and will enable fighting against an enemy with a reduced signature and in all combat scenarios, on the current and future battlefield, against the entirety of threats that exist for the maneuvering force.” As tensions in the Middle East continue to ramp up, Israel’s arsenal of Merkava MBTs will certainly contribute to the nation’s security.

 its defense measures all around. Israel’s armored corps was specifically impacted as military officials expanded the number of regular army tank companies in each battalion. By ensuring that additional regular army soldiers are manning these tanks instead of reservists, the IDF is better positioned to defend its borders if future offensive tactics are carried out by hostile neighbors. Following the founding of the Jewish state, Israel was set to procure and domestically produce the United Kingdom’s Chieftain tank."

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

Talib, meanwhile, said he was grateful to be alive.  

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Israeli army to confront resilient foe in anticipated ground invasion into Gaza

An Israeli invasion of Gaza will face an enemy that has built a formidable armoury with Iran's help, dug a vast tunnel network to evade attackers and has shown in past ground wars it can exact a heavier toll on Israeli troops each time.

Key points:
-----------

*   Scores of Israeli hostages seized by Hamas could now be held in the warren of tunnels underneath Gaza which soldiers must clear to destroy Hamas
*   Gaza fighters in the past have used the underground network to strike and vanish
*   Despite strong signals,  Israel's political leaders had not yet made a decision on when to begin the ground assault

As Israel masses tanks on Gaza's border and politicians suggest the start of an invasion is a matter of when not if, Israel's generals will look to lessons learned from past ground offensives in 2008 and 2014 that also aimed to smash the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, an Israeli security source and experts said.

Yet terrorist organisation Hamas has till now emerged a tougher opponent each time and on October 7 killed more than 1,300 Israelis — most of them civilians — in the deadliest attack on Israeli soil since its founding in 1948.

Israeli air strikes in response have killed more than 1,400 people in Gaza.

Neither side can know exactly what to expect in a ground war.

Loading...

Israel has promised a campaign exceeding anything ever launched to wipe Hamas "off the face of the earth", while Hamas has in the past shown its ability to survive and surprise, and will be fighting in a dense urban setting with powerful weapons.

"A ground incursion will be like diving into the unknown by the occupation and its forces," an official in one of Gaza's Palestinian militant factions told Reuters, giving only his nickname of Abu Abdallah.

Israeli officials have made clear it will not be a swift or easy campaign.

On Thursday, [an Israeli army spokesperson said the army is preparing for a "ground manoeuvre"](/news/2023-10-12/israel-prepares-ground-manoeuvre-against-hamas-gaza-invasion/102971498)
 but that the country's political leaders had not yet made a decision when to begin.

And this time it faces the problem that scores of Israeli hostages seized by Hamas on October 7 could now be held in the warren of tunnels that Israeli troops call the "Gaza Metro" and which soldiers must clear to destroy Hamas.

"The purpose is to defeat the entire military capabilities and military apparatus of Hamas and that will demand a long operation," an Israeli security source told Reuters.

> "Most of the targets, people, equipment, logistics are located underground and it's possible the hostages are located underground,"

the source said.

"The purpose will be to flatten the ground to then be able to get to the underground bunkers."

In Gaza, a strip of land with 2.3 million people, the risk of a mounting civilian death toll could also complicate Israel's military plans.

Massive tunnel network under Gaza 
----------------------------------

Based on past experience, Israel's bunker buster bombs and hi-tech Merkava tanks will be up against booby-trapped tunnels, fighters using the underground network to strike and vanish, and a range of Hamas weaponry that includes Russian-made Kornet anti-tank missiles that Israel first reported used in 2010.

The tunnels, stretching dozens of kilometres within the Gaza Strip, first appeared in response to an Israeli blockade imposed after Hamas took power to smuggle in food, fuel, medicines and other goods.

A ground offensive into Gaza means Israeli forces will face a vast tunnel network under the Gaza Strip used by Hamas to evade attackers. (Reuters: Jack Guez/Pool)

However, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have in the past alleged that Hamas uses these tunnels as weapons caches, bunkers, command centres and a concealed transportation artery for terrorists, weapons, including rocket launchers.

IDF has also alleged that Hamas has invested millions of dollars and other resources in building and operating its massive tunnel network.

Khaled Mashal, a former leader of Hamas described the tunnels [during the 2014 conflict with Israel.](/news/2015-06-22/war-crimes-likely-by-both-sides-in-2014-gaza-war:-un-report/6565370)
 

Hamas spokespeople have declined to comment to Reuters about any military operations or planning.

Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy chief of Hamas politburo, told Al Jazeera that before Hamas unleashed its assault on Israel it had a defence plan that was stronger than its attack plan.

Israeli officials have not discussed any military details.

An Israel Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: "We are preparing for a ground offensive" and the goal was to heavily damage "terrorist infrastructure" so it was no longer a threat to Israel.

But Gaza residents have already spotted what they believe to be invasion preparations in the intense Israeli bombardment of the enclave since the initial assault by Hamas.

Residents say bombing has levelled corridors of land along the border that could open the way for ground forces.

But Palestinian militant official Abu Abdallah said Gaza's fighters were ready.

> "Planes do not determine a battle. Many fighters would prefer to face tanks and forces on the ground, armed by the developed capabilities built up over years,"

he said.

Since 2007, when Hamas took control of Gaza from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, Israel has launched two major land incursions.

Each time it suffered a higher death toll of soldiers — nine killed in 2008 and 66 in 2014.

This time, Hamas has had longer to prepare, making no secret of support coming from Iran, Israel's arch regional foe.

Learning lessons
----------------

Recently Israeli troops were confronted with the growing capability of militants [in a West Bank clash in June.](/news/2023-06-21/palestinian-gunmen-kill-four-israelis-in-west-bank/102503868)

In a raid on Jenin refugee camp, a Hamas hotbed, Israeli soldiers were ambushed and pinned down. Apache helicopter support was called in to help.

"The difference between what is happening in Gaza compared to the battle of Jenin camp is between heaven and earth," said a member of the Jenin Brigade.

"We do not have military barracks or heavy weapons such as rockets and Kornets."

A former senior Israeli commander, who asked not to be identified, said confrontations like Jenin still offered lessons as the military prepared for a Gaza incursion.

> "You will have to look at Gaza (as having) much more high capacities and with highly developed technology all over,"

he said.

Israel's government, which under Mr Netanyahu had been one of the most hard-right in its history but now includes opposition figures to build national unity, has said the public must prepare for a long conflict to reach its goal.

"We started the offensive from the air, later on we will also come from the ground," Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers near the border fence on Tuesday, one of the strongest signals that an invasion will go ahead.

Loading...

Shalom Ben Hanan, a former top official in Israel's Shin Bet security service and now a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel's Reichman University, said a ground offensive was the only way to dismantle Hamas.

"There is no sterile war. We will suffer casualties," he said.

"We are going to fight, to make combat with very experienced and trained fighters.

> "It must be a decisive win."

Israeli forces conduct new raids, searches in southern Syria

Israeli tanks take position on the border with Syria in the Golan Heights – AFP

**DAMASCUS, Syria (North Press) –** Israeli forces advanced on Saturday into southern Syria, with dozens of military vehicles entering the village of al-Asha in the Quneitra countryside. Israeli military vehicles also entered the village of al-Samadaniyah al-Sharqiya in Quneitra, where they raided a house and conducted a search.

The Israeli army announced to have discovered weapons in multiple locations across southern Syria during the operations, stating that several individuals involved in hostile activities were arrested, and weapons were seized.

This comes after an Israeli airdrop last week targeting a military site about 30 kilometers south of Damascus, which had been struck repeatedly in recent days.

Since the fall of al-Assad regime, Israel has significantly increased its incursions into southern Syria. Its ongoing strikes and raids on various sites have raised tensions, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirming his country’s commitment to establishing a demilitarized zone in southern Syria.

Israel strikes military tanks in southern Syria
===============================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 14, 2025 9:53 AM EDT

BUSRA AL-HARIR, Syria (AP) — Israel’s army said Monday it has struck military tanks in southern Syria, where government forces and Bedouin tribes clashed with Druze militias.

Dozens of people have been killed in the fighting between local militias and clans in Syria’s Sweida province. In May, Israeli forces struck a site near the presidential palace in Damascus, in what was seen as a warning to Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The strike came after dozens were killed in fighting between pro-government gunmen and Druze fighters earlier this year in the town of Sahnaya and the Druze-majority Damascus suburb of Jaramana.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement at the time that Israel “will not allow the deployment of (Syrian government) forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community.”

Over half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.

In Israel, Druze are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the armed forces.

While many Druze in Syria have said they do not want Israel to intervene on their behalf, factions from the Druze minority have also been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fled the country in December during a rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south.

The Druze developed their own militias during the country’s nearly 14-year civil war, during which they sometimes faced attacks by the Islamic State and other Islamist militant groups.

Israel has taken an aggressive stance toward Syria’s new leaders since Assad’s fall, saying it does not want Islamist militants near its borders. Israeli forces earlier seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Syrian territory along the border with the Golan Heights and have launched hundreds of airstrikes on military sites in Syria.

The Trump administration has been pushing for the new Syrian government to move toward normalization with Israel. Government security forces that were sent to restore order Monday also clashed with local armed groups.

Syria’s Interior Ministry has said more than 30 people have died and nearly 100 others have been injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported at least 89 dead, including two children, two women and 14 members of the security forces.

The clashes in Syria initially broke out between armed groups from the Druze and Sunni Bedouin clans, the observatory said, with some members of the government security forces “actively participating” in support of the Bedouins.

Interior Ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba said government forces entered Sweida in the early morning to restore order.

“Some clashes occurred with outlawed armed groups, but our forces are doing their best to prevent any civilian casualties,” he told the state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV.

The observatory said the clashes started after a series of kidnappings between both groups, which began when members of a Bedouin tribe in the area set up a checkpoint where they attacked and robbed a young Druze man.

Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.

Syria’s defense and interior ministries were deploying personnel to the area to attempt to restore order.

The Interior Ministry described the situation as a dangerous escalation that “comes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation despite repeated calls for calm.”

U.N. Deputy Special Envoy for Syria Najat Rochdi expressed “deep concern” over the violence and urged the government and local groups to “take immediate steps to protect civilians, restore calm, and prevent incitement.”

She said in a statement the clashes underscored the “urgent need for genuine inclusion, trust-building, and meaningful dialogue to advance a credible and inclusive political transition in Syria.”

Israel sees Druze as a loyal minority
-------------------------------------

Israel has previously intervened in Syria in defense of the Druze religious minority. On several occasions, Druze groups have clashed with security forces from the new government or allied factions.

A group led by Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, a Druze spiritual leader who has been opposed to the new government in Damascus, on Monday issued a statement calling for “international protection” and accused government forces and General Security agency of “supporting takfiri gangs” – using a term for extremist Sunni militants.

‘Like unwrapping an onion’
--------------------------

The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The reverse image search and geolocation data do not provide definitive information about the image's location. However, the web search results indicate that Israeli forces have been active in Syria, including entering the buffer zone and reaching Qatana, which is near Damascus, in December 2024. Therefore, the claim that the image shows the Israeli army in Syria in December 2024 is plausible. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image was taken in Damascus.

The image is likely taken in the vicinity of the Israeli-Syrian border, and the Israeli army has been active in Syria. While the claim states the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus, the evidence does not confirm the exact location. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.78, 'Palestine': 0.2, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The North Press Agency reported on August 30, 2025, that Israeli forces entered the village of al-Asha in the Quneitra countryside, southern Syria (<image:11993>). Wikipedia discusses the Israeli invasion of Syria (2024–present), stating that on December 8, 2024, Israeli armored units entered the buffer zone and were reported as far as Qatana, 26 kilometers from Damascus (<image:10240>). A PBS News article from July 14, 2025, reported on Israeli strikes on military tanks in southern Syria and mentioned clashes in Syria's Sweida province and a strike near the presidential palace in Damascus (<image:12070>).

## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The reverse image search and geolocation data do not provide definitive information about the image's location. However, the web search results indicate that Israeli forces have been active in Syria, including entering the buffer zone and reaching Qatana, which is near Damascus, in December 2024. Therefore, the claim that the image shows the Israeli army in Syria in December 2024 is plausible. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image was taken in Damascus.



## Final Judgement
The image is likely taken in the vicinity of the Israeli-Syrian border, and the Israeli army has been active in Syria. While the claim states the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus, the evidence does not confirm the exact location. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Israeli tanks, and while the Israeli army has been active in Syria, including near Damascus, the evidence does not confirm the image's exact location. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There were protests in Warsaw on the day after the Polish government passed a resolution guaranteeing safe conduct for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuImage: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/IMAGO

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

There are claims the resolution sought to avert the risk of a crisis in US-Polish relations right at the start of Trump's second administrationImage: Carlos Barria/REUTERS

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

Pre-Trial Chamber I stated that it found reasonable grounds that from " at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024" Netanyahu and Gallant bear criminal responsibility "as co-perpetrators for committing the acts jointly with others: the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts" and "as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population."[\[27\]](#cite_note-ICC_issues_warrants_Netanyahu_Gallant-28)
 and that Deif bears direct and command responsibility "for the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, torture, and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other form of sexual violence".

 of [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
 and [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
, the [International Criminal Court](/wiki/International_Criminal_Court "International Criminal Court")
 (ICC) issued [arrest warrants](/wiki/Arrest_warrant "Arrest warrant")
 for two senior [Israeli](/wiki/Israel "Israel")
 officials, [Benjamin Netanyahu](/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu "Benjamin Netanyahu")
, the [prime minister of Israel](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel "Prime Minister of Israel")
, and [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, the former [Minister of Defense of Israel](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
, alleging responsibility for the war crime of [starvation as a method of warfare](/wiki/Starvation_(crime) "Starvation (crime)")
 and the crimes against humanity of [murder](/wiki/Murder "Murder")
, [persecution](/wiki/Persecution "Persecution")
, and other inhumane acts during the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[1\]](#cite_note-BBC_arrest_warrants_issued-1)
[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
 The warrant against Netanyahu is the first against the leader of a Western-backed democratic country for war crimes.[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)

All [125 ICC member states](/wiki/States_parties_to_the_Rome_Statute "States parties to the Rome Statute")
, including France and the United Kingdom, are required to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter the state's territory.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
 The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 military commander [Mohammed Deif](/wiki/Mohammed_Deif "Mohammed Deif")
, who was killed in an [Israeli airstrike on 13 July 2024](/wiki/13_July_2024_al-Mawasi_attack "13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack")

Background
----------

Main article: [International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine](/wiki/International_Criminal_Court_investigation_in_Palestine "International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg/250px-International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg)](/wiki/File:International_Criminal_Court_2022.jpg)

The premises of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands

The ICC was established in 2002 to prosecute [war crimes](/wiki/War_crime "War crime")
, [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity "Crimes against humanity")
, [genocide](/wiki/Genocide "Genocide")
, and the [crime of aggression](/wiki/Crime_of_aggression "Crime of aggression")
 when member states are unwilling or unable to do so. The report also claimed that ICC judges had issued a gag order forbidding Khan from publicly revealing that he had requested the warrants.[\[29\]](#cite_note-30)
 The gag order was allegedly requested by members of Khan's staff who felt that his public announcements of the prior warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant "deviated from standard practice and put pressure on judges reviewing the warrant requests".[\[30\]](#cite_note-31)

Prior to taking indefinite leave from the prosecutor's office in May 2025, Khan was reportedly preparing draft arrest warrants for [Itamar Ben-Gvir](/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir "Itamar Ben-Gvir")
 and [Bezalel Smotrich](/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich "Bezalel Smotrich")
 for their involvement in building illegal settlements.[\[31\]](#cite_note-32)
[\[32\]](#cite_note-33)
 According to sources within the ICC, Khan had completed the warrant applications before taking his leave, but his deputies had not yet submitted them to the court.[\[33\]](#cite_note-34)

### Starvation as a weapon of war

One of the key allegations was the "use of starvation as a weapon of war".[\[34\]](#cite_note-35)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-36)
[\[36\]](#cite_note-37)
[\[37\]](#cite_note-38)
[\[38\]](#cite_note-39)
 The use of starvation as weapon of war is banned by the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations")
.[\[39\]](#cite_note-40)
 Since then it has been used in both Gaza and Sudan.[\[40\]](#cite_note-41)
 In mid 2023 German government officials also accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon.[\[41\]](#cite_note-ips_journal-42)
[\[42\]](#cite_note-ipg_journal-43)
 Yoav Gallant made a public speech in early October 2023, shortly after the [Hamas attacks on Israel](/wiki/7_October_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel")
 that sparked the war, saying, "there will be no more electricity, no more food, no more fuel ... We are fighting against human animals and will behave accordingly."[\[43\]](#cite_note-44)
[\[44\]](#cite_note-45)
[\[45\]](#cite_note-46)
 A few weeks before that the arrest warrants were issued, there were also reports of looting occurring in areas controlled by the IDF.[\[46\]](#cite_note-47)
[\[47\]](#cite_note-48)

Possible execution of the arrest warrants
-----------------------------------------

### Speculated January 2025 visit to Poland

In December 2024 and January 2025, the possibility of Netanyahu visiting Poland, [party to the Rome Statute](/wiki/States_parties_to_the_Rome_Statute "States parties to the Rome Statute")
, on 27 January, the 80th anniversary of the [liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp](/wiki/Liberation_of_Auschwitz_concentration_camp "Liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp")
 was discussed by Polish politicians. The spokesperson stated that states with concerns about their obligations could consult with the ICC, but were not permitted to unilaterally determine the validity of the ICC's legal decisions.[\[51\]](#cite_note-OKOpress_ICC_calls_on_PL-52)
 Legal scholars [Karolina Wierczyńska](/w/index.php?title=Karolina_Wierczy%C5%84ska&action=edit&redlink=1 "Karolina Wierczyńska (page does not exist)")
, [Piotr Hofmański](/wiki/Piotr_Hofma%C5%84ski "Piotr Hofmański")
 and [Omer Bartov](/wiki/Omer_Bartov "Omer Bartov")
 stated that Netanyahu would have to be arrested if he visited Poland. Member of the [Sejm](/wiki/Sejm "Sejm")
 [Tomasz Trela](/wiki/Tomasz_Trela "Tomasz Trela")
 stated that Netanyahu would have to be "instantly" arrested the moment he crossed the Polish border.[\[48\]](#cite_note-OKOpress_govt_decree_undermines-49)
 Under Polish law, the [Rome Statute](/wiki/Rome_Statute "Rome Statute")
 is an international treaty obligation with legal priority above that of a Cabinet resolution.[\[52\]](#cite_note-Rzeczpospolita_procedure_ICC_fugitives-53)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions

web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions

web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. Accessibility links

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

The articles mention that Israel, with the help of the US, intercepted a large number of the missiles launched by Iran (<image:12214>, <image:12215>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland. Instead, it indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack. The evidence also shows that Netanyahu was later offered protection by Poland due to an ICC arrest warrant, but this was not related to the missile attack.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("Netanyahu Poland October 1 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland would protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest (<image:1>). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025, due to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes. Netanyahu has not confirmed his attendance.

DW.COM also discussed the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu for the Auschwitz commemoration event, mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend (<image:k>). The article was published on January 22, 2025. According to Wikipedia, on November 21, 2024, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant related to the Gaza war.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was potentially at risk of arrest by the ICC, which issued an arrest warrant for him on November 21, 2024. Poland offered him protection, allowing him to travel freely to Poland for an event on January 27, 2025. However, the evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, or Netanyahu fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid an Iranian missile attack.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

German Reconnaissance Company

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

## Final Judgement
The image provided shows the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, on June 19, 2024, after completing BALTOPS 24, which took place in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The claim states that the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). The web search results confirm that the U.S. has increased its military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, in August and September 2024. However, the image itself is not related to the claim.

The claim is demonstrably false because the image is not related to the claim. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim depicts the USS Mount Whitney arriving in Kiel, Germany, in June 2024, not U.S. warships en route to Lebanon in August 2024 as stated in the claim. While there was an increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East in August and September 2024, the image is unrelated to this. Therefore, the claim is false.

CNN  — 

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after Hamas attacked southern Israel."

Content: "<image:12311>!Reuters Palestinians inspect damage following an Israeli strike on Mustafa Hafez school, which was sheltering displaced people, in Gaza City, in the northern Gaza Strip (20 August 2024) <image:12312>Reuters

The UN condemned earlier this month what it called the “increasing frequency” of Israeli strikes on schools

At least 12 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City, the Hamas-run Civil Defence authority says.

A spokesman said rescuers were struggling to recover a number of missing people believed to be trapped under the rubble at Mustafa Hafez school in the western Rimal neighbourhood.

The Israeli military said it had targeted a Hamas command and control centre inside the school, and that it had taken steps to mitigate risk of harming civilians.

Earlier, it announced that troops had recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages being held in the Khan Younis area.

The men were among the 251 people kidnapped by Hamas-led gunmen in the 7 October attacks on southern Israel last year, when about 1,200 people were also killed.

Israel launching an air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas in response, during which more than 40,170 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Women and children can be heard screaming and seen running from the dust-enveloped Mustafa Hafez school in a video posted on social media showing the immediate aftermath of Tuesday morning’s strike.

The camera then pans to show rubble on the ground beside the completely flattened remains of a two-storey building.

"We were sitting safely, we did not see the explosion," witness Umm Mohammed later told Reuters news agency.

"The people are gone, they're dead. They are under the rubble."

Civil Defence spokesman Mahmoud Basal said in the afternoon that rescue crews had so far recovered the bodies of 12 people.

He said the strike had targeted the entire wing of the school, where he estimated that 700 displaced people had been living.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said aircraft had conducted a “a precise strike on terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command and control centre” which had been embedded inside the school and used to plan and launch attacks against its troops and Israel.

"Prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence," it added.

The IDF accused Hamas of violating international law by operating within civilian infrastructure and exploiting Gaza’s civilian population - allegations which Hamas has previously denied.

Earlier this month, the UN Human Rights Office condemned what it called the "increasing frequency" of Israeli strikes on schools sheltering displaced people and accused the IDF of conducting them "with apparent disregard for the high rate of civilian fatalities".

The warning after [at least 70 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on al-Taba’een school in Gaza City](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8erk37yn2no)
, according to the director of a local hospital.

The IDF said the school had "served as an active Hamas and Islamic Jihad military facility", and that it had confirmed the identities of 31 "terrorists" who were killed.

The UN said at the time that it had been at least the 21st strike on a school serving as a shelter since 4 July and that they had resulted in at least 274 fatalities.

Also on Tuesday, the civil defence said five people had been killed in a strike on a house in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, while Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medical sources as saying four had been killed in nearby Deir al-Balah.

The IDF said its troops and aircraft had "eliminated numerous terrorists" operating in central Gaza, including two who exited an underground tunnel and attempted to plant an explosive device.

It came as the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, visited Egypt to continue to apply diplomatic pressure to try to secure a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

The BBC's Tom Bateman, who is travelling with Mr Blinken, says the Americans hope for some sort of breakthrough within the next week or so, but that the mood on the ground in the region has not matched that expectation.

After talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, Mr Blinken said Israel had accepted a US proposal aimed at bridging the remaining gaps between the warring parties.

But Hamas accused the US of "acquiescing" to what it called Mr Netanyahu's "new conditions".

! The group also criticised as misleading President Joe Biden’s claim that it seemed to be “backing away” from an agreement.

A major sticking point is Mr Netanyahu's insistence that Israeli troops remain in the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow strip of land running along Gaza’s border with Egypt, which Hamas has rejected.

He says it is necessary to prevent smuggling and Hamas rearming itself, but Hamas says it would amount to continued Israeli occupation and not an end to the war.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit a school being used by displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 30 people including several children, as the country’s negotiators prepared to meet international mediators to discuss a proposed cease-fire.

At least seven children and seven women were among the dead taken from the girls' school in Deir al-Balah to Al Aqsa Hospital. The Israeli military said one of its aircraft attacked from the air as part of its activity in Nablus.

According to Israeli estimates, about 1.8 million Palestinians shelter in the zone after being uprooted multiple times during Israel’s punishing air and ground campaign. "What happens is when people have these orders, they have very little time to move.”

Farther north, Palestinians mourned seven killed by Israeli airstrikes overnight on Zawaida, in central Gaza. <image:12320>

Palestinians displaced by the Israeli air and ground offensive on the Gaza Strip flee from parts of Khan Younis on Saturday, following an evacuation order by the Israeli army to leave parts of the southern area of Gaza Strip's second largest city. Israel's military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against Israeli troops and develop and store "large quantities of weapons.” Hamas in a statement called the military’s claim false.

Civil defense workers in Gaza said thousands had been sheltering in the school, which also contained a medical site.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl)) reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, which resulted in at least 30 deaths. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City on August 20, 2024, which was sheltering displaced people, resulting in at least 12 Palestinian deaths. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike)) also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza on July 27, 2024, which was being used as a shelter by displaced Palestinians, resulting in at least 30 deaths.

The CNN article does not include the image in the claim. The NPR article includes images <image:12320>, <image:12323>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence from CNN, BBC News, and NPR reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. These reports describe attacks on schools, resulting in casualties. However, none of the articles include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The NPR article includes images of the aftermath of the airstrikes, but they do not match the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the source of the image and whether it is related to the reported events.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:10254>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

Gaza: Baby pulled alive from rubble after Israeli air strike on Rafah
=====================================================================

Rescuers in the city of Rafah, southern Gaza, have pulled a baby girl alive from the rubble after an Israeli air strike.

People used their hands to free Mariam Abu Akel from the debris, before a rescuer ran with her to a nearby hospital.

Doctors there swabbed her cuts.

The baby had been sheltering in a house with her family when the strike took place, which killed her mother and sister, Reuters reported. Her father and young brother survived.

The air strike killed 20 people and injured 55, according to a Hamas-run health ministry spokesperson.

More than 21,500 people - mostly children and women - have been killed during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. <image:12347>!Riyad Mansour (left) Permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN, and Jonathan Miller, Deputy Permanent Representative for Israel to the UN <image:12349>\

The Getty Images search result ([https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gaza-wounded-palestinian-boy](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/gaza-wounded-palestinian-boy)) contains images of Palestinian children, Israeli airstrikes, and rubble in Gaza, with some images dated from 2003 to 2024. Alamy.com ([https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/palestinian-child-in-rubble.html](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/palestinian-child-in-rubble.html)) also provides stock photos of Palestinian children in rubble, including the image in the claim <image:10254>. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-67843832](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-67843832)) from December 2023 reports on the Israel-Gaza war, mentioning an Israeli air strike in Rafah, Gaza, and includes several images, none of which match the image in the claim.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The Alamy.com search result confirms that the image in the claim, <image:10254>, is a stock photo of a Palestinian child in rubble. The Getty Images search result also shows images related to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the provided evidence does not specify the exact date or context of the image in the claim.

The BBC News article from December 2023 reports on the Israel-Gaza war, but the images in the article do not match the image in the claim.

Based on the evidence, the claim that the image shows a Palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike is plausible, given the context of the image and the events in Gaza. However, the exact date (July 2024) cannot be verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl)) reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, on July 27, 2024, which resulted in at least 30 deaths. The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9zxlpz5evo)) discusses an Israeli strike on a school in Gaza City on August 20, 2024, which was sheltering displaced people, resulting in at least 12 Palestinian deaths. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike)) also reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza on July 27, 2024, which was being used as a shelter by displaced Palestinians, resulting in at least 30 deaths.

The CNN article does not include the image in the claim. The NPR article includes images <image:12320>, <image:12323>.


## Elaboration
The provided evidence from CNN, BBC News, and NPR reports on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. These reports describe attacks on schools, resulting in casualties. However, none of the articles include the image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence.

The NPR article includes images of the aftermath of the airstrikes, but they do not match the image in the claim.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed, such as the source of the image and whether it is related to the reported events.

The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or Israel. This aligns with the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian child in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image, such as the date or the cause of the rubble.

The evidence from the web search provides information about Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July and August 2024. While the image could potentially be related to these events, there is no direct link established.

To further verify the claim, it would be necessary to identify the source of the image and confirm its context, including the date and the cause of the damage.

Network of Syria conspiracy theorists identified – study
========================================================

This article is more than 3 years old

Campaign disseminating disinformation sent thousands of tweets, often targeting the White Helmets, research finds

A network of more than two dozen conspiracy theorists, frequently backed by a coordinated Russian campaign, sent thousands of disinformation tweets to distort the reality of [the Syrian conflict](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/07/ten-grim-lessons-the-world-has-learned-from-a-decade-of-war-in-syria)
 and deter intervention by the international community, new analysis says.

[Data gathered by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD)](https://deadlydisinformation.org/)
 identified a group of social media accounts, individuals, outlets and organisations who disseminated disinformation about the conflict, with 1.8 million people following their every word. According to the research, the three principal false narratives that were promoted involved misrepresenting [the White Helmets,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/syria-white-helmets-conspiracy-theories)
 the volunteer organisation working to evacuate people in Syria. They also focused on the denial or distortion of facts about the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and on attacking the findings of the world’s foremost chemical weapons watchdog.

The White Helmets became a target of Russian ire after documenting incidents such as the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhoun in 2017, which killed 92 people, a third of them children. A UN unit later concluded there were “reasonable grounds to believe that Syrian forces dropped a bomb dispersing sarin” on the town in Idlib province.

The new analysis, contained in a report by The [Syria](https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria)
 Campaign, also found that official Russian government accounts played a key role in creating and spreading false content, with the Russian embassy to the UK and Syria playing a prominent role.

Of the 47,000 disinformation tweets sent by the core of 28 conspiracy theorists over seven years from 2015 to 2021, 19,000 were original posts, which were retweeted more than 671,000 times.

Among those named in the report as an influential spreader of disinformation are Vanessa Beeley, a self-described independent journalist whose conspiracy theories have been cited as evidence by Russia at the UN security council.

In September 2015 Beeley accused White Helmets of being in league with al-Qaida and other terrorist organisations, claiming that the footage they gather as they rescue civilians from bombed-out buildings is staged.

Farouq Habib, White Helmets deputy manager, said: “At first we really thought this could just be someone who didn’t have enough correct info, and we should contact her to explain.

But then with some research, we realised it’s deliberate and systematic.”

There is also a group of British academics accused of spreading pro-Syrian regime disinformation and conspiracy theories promoted by Russia. Since 2020, journalist Aaron Maté at the Grayzone is said by the report to have overtaken Beeley as the most prolific spreader of disinformation among the 28 conspiracy theorists identified. \[Maté rejects the claim – see 10 July 2022 footnote.\]

Lina Sergie Attar, founder and chief executive of Karam Foundation, said: “It’s insulting that a group of western conspiracy theorists think they hold a higher moral standard but just spread their lies.”

Others include Canadian independent journalist Eva Bartlett who appeared on a Syrian government panel at the UN, alleging that the White Helmets stage rescues. One version of the talk has been viewed 4.5m times on Facebook.

White Helmets volunteers are the most frequently attacked targets with more than 21,000 tweets designed to discredit the group or encourage attacks against their first responders. Hamid Kutini, a volunteer in north-west Syria said: “The \[Syrian\] regime and Russia makes our lifesaving work extremely risky through double-tap attacks. When we go to save people from a bombed site, they re-target the same area to kill the first responders.”

So far 296 volunteers have been killed in the line of duty since 2012.

The effect of this barrage of disinformation, according to The Syria Campaign, has been to sow confusion and doubt among government policymakers, helping create anti-asylum policies, normalisation of Syria’s Assad regime and emboldening Russian president Vladimir Putin to replicate the tactics in Ukraine.

“Syria was a testing ground for this type of disinformation activity and the lessons learned from this case can inform action on Ukraine and beyond,” a former official at the US Department of State told researchers.

The headline of this article was amended on 19 June 2022 to remove a reference to the network being “Russia-backed”. As indicated in the text, the network was “frequently backed by a coordinated Russian campaign”, but not exclusively so. It was further amended on 18 August 2022 to give additional attribution to the ISD study in the headings and opening paragraphs.

Strengthen Norms Against Chemical Weapons Use
=============================================

[Arms Control Today](/sections/arms-control-today)

  
January/February 2021  
By [Wardah Amir](#bio)

The last time Joe Biden was in the White House, the United States was concerned about the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Over the past four years, chemical attacks have continued within and beyond Syrian borders with the emergence of new state perpetrators. International norms established under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) have been blatantly violated by state and nonstate actors as chemicals are misused as weapons.

![A Syrian girl holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a make-shift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma, Syria in 2018. The Trump administration was marked by its inconsistent response to instances of chemical weapons use in the past four years. (Photo: Hasan Mohamed//AFP/Getty Images)](/sites/default/files/images/ACT_Photos/2021_01/12_ACTJanFeb2021_Feature_Amir.png)Following the 2017 presidential inauguration, the Trump administration had to address immediately the use of chemical weapons by state actors when Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was assassinated with VX nerve agent in Malaysia. The United States blamed and sanctioned North Korea, which is not party to the CWC, for this fatal chemical attack.

Unfortunately, chemical weapons were used again as instruments of assassination when Russia employed Novichok nerve agent against its opposition. In 2018, Sergei and Yulia Skripal were injured in a chemical attack in Salisbury, United Kingdom. More recently in 2020, Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny survived another chemical poisoning by Russia, which has failed to adhere to its CWC commitments. In a bipartisan effort, U.S. lawmakers asked the Trump administration to impose additional sanctions on Russia following an investigation into the Navalny poisoning. Such a move will now likely fall on the Biden administration’s to-do list to hold Russia accountable for its use of chemical weapons.

It is important to hold chemical weapons perpetrators accountable because it sets a precedent that there are consequences for challenging the norms. These consequences can deter other actors from engaging in chemical weapons programs and attacks. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has been generating reports on allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria, but it is the responsibility of states-parties to decide what they want to do with the findings of these reports because the OPCW is not mandated to be a judicial body. Therefore, the U.S. response to every chemical weapons attack, big or small, is important, not only to decide the fate of those violating the treaty but also to lead the international community to rally behind a common goal to reinforce the norms that have been broken.

The Trump administration’s response to chemical weapons use was inconsistent and seemed to vary by perpetrator. Although North Korea and Russia were sanctioned under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991 (CBW Act), the Trump administration decided to launch military strikes against Syria on two occasions: following the 2017 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhun that killed at least 70 civilians and the 2018 chemical attack in Douma that resulted in at least 40 fatalities. The United States has attributed at least 50 chemical attacks to the Assad regime since the beginning of the civil war in Syria, and even though this far exceeds the allegations of use against North Korea and Russia, each instance of chemical weapons use, regardless of magnitude or scale, must be treated as a violation of international law.

In contrast to his military response in Syria, President Donald Trump decided to meet with Kim Jong Un at the 2018 Singapore summit, despite the assassination of Kim’s half brother. The two leaders discussed denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but failed to address North Korea’s chemical weapons program. Following the Salisbury incident, the United States joined its allies in another nonmilitary response with the diplomatic expulsion of 60 Russian intelligence officers. Although the United States should further explore nonmilitary options for reinforcing the norms, it is important that the redline be drawn equally for all users of chemical weapons.

Unfortunately, the Trump administration’s response failed to halt the contraventions of the CWC. The Trump administration did use military force to respond to chemical weapons use, but the United States can and should better utilize the nonmilitary toolbox: diplomacy, sanctions, and legal accountability.

The Biden administration should be prepared to issue a strong political statement condemning the increase in use of chemical weapons in recent years and calling out state perpetrators (North Korea, Russia, and Syria) by name. This statement should include the importance of international cooperation and appreciation for allies that work together to uphold CWC norms. Furthermore, the United States must not lose sight of Russia’s violations of the CWC when negotiating other arms control treaties, such as an extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. Negotiating arms control agreements is of utmost importance, and the Biden administration should avoid stovepiping nuclear and chemical weapons issues when preparing for future bilateral and multilateral dialogues on arms control. Although it is important to engage the Russians on arms control, the Biden administration will have to face the challenge of negotiating with a CWC violator.

Next, the Biden administration should track the status of investigations on the Navalny poisoning and related U.S. sanctions against Russia. If Trump fails to respond to Russia’s most recent use of chemical weapons, against Navalny in August 2020, the responsibility will fall on the new administration not only to issue tougher sanctions under the CBW Act, but also to deliver a political statement to announce the sanctions and condemn Russia’s continued violation of the CWC.

T![Cambodian officials attend an online session of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' annual meeting on the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Of the treaty's 193 member states, 119 have satisfied the requirement to have national implementing legislation. (Photo: OPCW)](/sites/default/files/images/ACT_Photos/2021_01/13_ACTJanFeb2021_Feature_Amir_OPCW.png)he United States also should provide foreign assistance to CWC states-parties in good standing with international norms to develop their national laws to penalize the use of chemical weapons. Despite the requirement in the CWC for the 193 member states to have national implementing laws, currently 39 states-parties only have accomplished this partially, and 35 states-parties are not satisfying this requirement at all. In 2018, the United States joined about 30 countries and international organizations for the launch of the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, a promising French initiative to identify and penalize perpetrators and build legal capacities. The goal of the Biden administration should be to mitigate legal safe havens for users of chemical weapons around the world and to develop capacities via bilateral and multilateral engagements, such as this international partnership, so that each partner country has the capabilities to prosecute those that should never have broken CWC norms.

Alleged Chemical Attack in Syria Puts the World on Edge
=======================================================

An alleged [chemical attack](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/ghouta-hospitals-shut-down-and-bodies-out-reach)
 on 7 April 2018 killed at least 42 people and injured more than a 1,000 in Douma, a town in the rebel-held enclave of [Eastern Ghouta](https://fanack.com/politics/features-insights/eastern-ghouta~96489/)
, outside Damascus. The international community responded immediately, accusing the [Syrian regime](https://fanack.com/syria/politics-of-syria/)
 of carrying out the attack. A week later, a coalition made up of the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and France launched an air strike, allegedly targeting chemical weapons plants in the country.

It is unknown if the strike was a success. The coalition claims it was whereas Russia said it had [intercepted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/russia-claims-syria-air-defences-shot-down-majority-missiles)
 71 of the 100 missiles reportedly launched.

The alleged attack came almost exactly a year after the [Khan Sheikhoun](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)
 chemical attack on 4 April 2017, whose effects looked exactly like this one. According to [medical sources](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/ghouta-hospitals-shut-down-and-bodies-out-reach)
, “The victims’ symptoms resemble that of sarin gas exposure such as difficulty breathing, vomiting and foaming from the nose and mouth. Chlorine attacks are not this deadly.”

The [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](https://www.opcw.org/)
 (OPCW), the implementing body of the  [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention)
 (CWC), set up its own independent fact-finding mission for Syria in 2014. It has investigated more than 70 cases of alleged toxic gas attacks in Syria since then. It is now investigating the Douma case, and has confirmed the use of a toxic gas. US officials [said](https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/984479890182430722)
 on 12 April that urine tests from Douma have tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent.

Douma has been a regular target of regime attacks for five years but has been under increased assault since [March 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/12/middleeast/syria-eastern-ghouta-divided-intl/index.html)
. The attacks allowed President Bashar al-Assad to [take Douma](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/12/syrian-flag-flying-onetime-rebel-stronghold-douma-russians-announce/)
 after the residents and rebels [fled](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack)
 in buses to Jarablus, a town near the Turkish border that is controlled by Ankara-backed rebel fighters. A [paramedic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/douma-inhabitants-prepare-leave-deadly-syria-chemical-attack)
 told the Guardian newspaper, “I am leaving tomorrow, God willing, because our mission has ended. I am saying thank God that the mass killings are over, but I am saddened that I will leave my land and my people, possibly never to return. But I will leave knowing that I gave everything I could until the end.”

In a statement, the [European External Action Service](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/node/42639_en)
 (EEAS) said, ‘We call on the supporters of the regime, Russia and [Iran](https://fanack.com/iran/)
, to use their influence to prevent any further attack and ensure a cessation of hostilities.’

French President [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.france24.com/en/20180412-macron-says-has-proof-syrian-chemical-attack-vows-response)
 said on 12 April 2018 that France would decide to strike when all the necessary information was gathered. “We have proof that last week, now 10 days ago, chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of [Bashar al-Assad](https://fanack.com/syria/history-of-syria/bashar-al-assad-since-2000/)
,” Macron said, after it became known that France was coordinating with the US on a possible military response. He had already [declared](https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fnews%2fworldviews%2fwp%2f2018%2f04%2f09%2fanother-president-faces-a-red-line-on-syria-he-drew-himself%2f%3futm_term%3d.aac55cf5d550&utm_term=.aac55cf5d550)
, as former US President Barack Obama had done, that chemical weapons were a “red line” but has done nothing since the beginning of his presidency to put an end to it. The same day, UK Prime Minister [Theresa May](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-us-war-live-updates-syria-war-crisis-latest-trump-nuclear-a8300821.html)
 called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the possibility of joining France and the US in a military strike. According to [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/11/theresa-may-moves-closer-joining-military-action-against-assad/)
, British submarines were ordered within missile range of Syria.

Yet it was the US that reacted most forcefully. On 9 April 2018, President [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/russia-us-un-security-council-syria-douma-attack)
 condemned the attack, saying he would decide in 24 to 48 hours if he was going to launch a reprisal offensive on Syria. In a [tweet](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/trump-animal-assad-tweet/)
, he denounced the ‘mindless CHEMICAL attack’ in Syria that killed women and children, called Bashar al-Assad an ‘animal’ and criticized Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/trump-big-price-to-pay-suspected-syria-chemical-weapons-attack)
 for supporting the Syrian government. [Asked by a reporter](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/russia-us-un-security-council-syria-douma-attack)
 if Putin had any responsibility for the attack, Trump replied: “He may, yeah, he may. And if he does, it’s going to be very tough, very tough. Everybody’s gonna pay a price. He will, everybody will.”

In a subsequent tweet, Trump [said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/politics/trump-syria-attack.html)
, ambiguously, that an attack in Syria ‘could be very soon or not so soon at all’. Just days after the [Khan Sheikhoun attack](https://fanack.com/politics/features-insights/chemical-weapons-attack~86433/)
 last year, the US [launched](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons)
 a cruise missile attack on a Syrian airfield, although it had no long-term consequence on the [war](https://fanack.com/syria/history-of-syria/the-syrian-crisis/)
.

In the wake of these announcements, [Eurocontrol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria/u-s-russia-clash-at-u-n-over-chemical-weapons-attacks-in-syria-idUSKBN1HG0D8)
, the pan-European air traffic control agency warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours. [Kuwait Airlines](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/kuwait-airways-ends-beirut-flights-amid-syria-war-fears/1115994)
 exercised extreme caution, cancelling all its flights to Lebanon. An attack on 9 April 2018, apparently by [Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-syria-strike-netanyahu-says-israel-will-hit-all-those-who-seek-to-harm-us/)
, that killed 14 Iranian military personnel on a Syrian base added to regional tensions, although it later became clear that this attack was not connected to the events in Douma.

The situation continues to be volatile, leaving the world and especially Syria and its neighbours on edge, fearing for the last scraps of stability they have. Once again, the recent air strike by the US, UK and France has had few tangible results, and many suggest they should have focused their efforts on trying to overthrow the regime instead.

A Palestinian baby girl, saved from the womb of her mother Sabreen Al-Sakani, who was killed in an Israeli strike along with her husband Shukri Jouda and her daughter Malak, lies in an incubator at the Emirati hospital in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, April 21.

Mohammed Salem/Reuters

RAFAH, Gaza Strip — There had been a glimmer of hope in Rafah this past weekend, when medics were able to rescue a baby girl from her mother's womb after airstrikes Saturday night killed her entire family.

Her mother was dead by the time she was brought to the field hospital, but doctors were able to operate on her outside its main structure quickly, performing an emergency cesarean section to pull her baby out.

The mother, Sabreen al-Sakani, had been 30 weeks pregnant. **Reuters TV/via REUTERS** ****hide caption****

Not all the Palestinians on the plane are leaving Gaza. As they reach 17,000ft (5,200m), they put on oxygen masks and make final precise adjustments for the drop.

For the first time, the cargo on board is British: four tonnes of supplies, including fuel, medical gear and food rations, to resupply the Jordanian-run field hospital in Gaza City.

Until now Britain has only sent aid by land and sea, but northern Gaza has become almost entirely unreachable.

Israel-Gaza: On board the plane evacuating injured Palestinians

Palestinians disembark an evacuation flight that has taken them from Egypt to the UAE

**Two very different flights in 24 hours, each with the same aim: to alleviate Gaza's suffering.**

The first is the less perilous: an Etihad Airways passenger plane, flight EY750 from Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. The Boeing 777 has been converted into a virtual flying ambulance with seats in economy turned into hospital beds.

Its mission, paid for by the government of the UAE, is to return civilians who had previously got out after being trapped in Rafah in southern Gaza, in some cases for months, and to evacuate wounded Palestinian children who had crossed from Gaza to al-Arish in Egypt's northern Sinai.

After hours on the ground, the first evacuees start to make it on board. She says 25 members of her family were killed in an Israeli air strike on their home in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

"During the war they were displaced," she tells me. The UN has been warning for months of the threat of famine in northern Gaza.

I watch as the cargo doors opened and the first two pallets of supplies fly off into the black night. But this aid sent into the night at least manages to get through; the crew confirms it has landed right on target.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches indicate that the image was taken in Douma, Syria, in 2018, and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask. The claim is therefore false.

The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches indicate that the image was taken in Douma, Syria, in 2018, and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask. The claim is therefore false.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is from Douma, Syria, in 2018, and not from the Gaza war in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim is not from the Gaza war in July 2024. Reverse image searches reveal that the image was taken in Douma, Syria, in 2018, and depicts a Syrian girl holding an oxygen mask, as reported by sources like The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/russia-backed-network-of-syria-conspiracy-theorists-identified](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/19/russia-backed-network-of-syria-conspiracy-theorists-identified)).

Content: "They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")

.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp. According to countercurrents.org, they died on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the "2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre," which occurred on June 8, 2024, but does not mention the children. The CNN article does not mention the image.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows Mayar and Bilal Hamida. However, the claim also states that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. The information about the children's deaths is confirmed, but the information about their mother and grandmother is missing.

*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat\_rescue\_and\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_rescue_and_massacre)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida (9 years old) and Bilal Hamida (6 years old) were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp. According to countercurrents.org, they died on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. The Wikipedia article mentions a separate event, the "2024 Nuseirat rescue and massacre," which occurred on June 8, 2024, but does not mention the children. The CNN article does not mention the image.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows Mayar and Bilal Hamida. However, the claim also states that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother, which is not mentioned in the provided evidence.

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence. The information about the children's deaths is confirmed, but the information about their mother and grandmother is missing.


## Actions
```
web_search("Mayar Hamida Bilal Hamida mother grandmother Al-Jaoni UN school")
```

## Evidence
No new evidence found.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school.

The claim that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother cannot be verified, as no evidence supports this statement.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts Mayar Hamida and Bilal Hamida, who were killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp on July 6, 2024, when Israel bombed the UN Al Jaoni school. However, the claim that they were killed along with their mother and grandmother cannot be verified due to a lack of evidence.

`false`

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

New Report! During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. [Photo Credit: Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP]")The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians by Israeli forces is a reoccurring issue in the weekly field reports gathered by Al-Haq. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers."

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)

**GAZA CITY, Palestine**

A 70-year-old Palestinian woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, still grapples with the trauma of being viciously attacked by an Israeli army dog in her small home In Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, located in the northern Gaza Strip. 

While lying in bed after her night prayers, she was suddenly attacked by an Israeli army dog, which stormed into her room and bit deeply into her arm.

This incident occurred during a 20-day attack by the Israeli military on the camp from May 12 to May 31.

Recounting her ordeal to Anadolu, the elderly woman said: "As I was drifting off to sleep, the dog wearing a camera on its back entered the room and attacked me. The \[Israeli\] dog then began dragging me, sinking all its teeth into my hand❞

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.
