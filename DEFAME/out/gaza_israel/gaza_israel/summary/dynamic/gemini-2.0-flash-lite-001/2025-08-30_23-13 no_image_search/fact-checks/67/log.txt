Useful result: From [Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/): 
Content: The Armenian Weekly published an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the "second civil war" in Syria, focusing on the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel. The article mentions Turkey's direct intervention in Syria in March 2025, with a photo of Turkish military forces in northern Syria during that time. <image:11663> The article also discusses the competing foreign agendas of Turkey and Israel in Syria.

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The fact-check did not find evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of strained relations between Turkey and Israel, and Turkey's involvement in Syria during that time, no sources ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)) or ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) mention any such communication.

So, the overall veracity is: false
