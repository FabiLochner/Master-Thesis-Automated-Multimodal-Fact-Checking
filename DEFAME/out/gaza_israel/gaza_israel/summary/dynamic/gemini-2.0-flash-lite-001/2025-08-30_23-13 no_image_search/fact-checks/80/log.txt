The claim '<image:10244> This image shows coffins of dead Israeli soldiers in September, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages killed in Gaza, as reported by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/) and [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/). The claim is partially correct as it correctly identifies the image's context and date. However, the claim is not entirely accurate as it does not specify whether the coffins represent soldiers or civilians.

So, the overall veracity is: false
