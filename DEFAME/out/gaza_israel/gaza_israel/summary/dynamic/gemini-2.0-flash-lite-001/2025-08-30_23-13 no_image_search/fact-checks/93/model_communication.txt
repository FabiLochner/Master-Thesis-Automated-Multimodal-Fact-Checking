 Most personal Windows PCs were unaffected, since CrowdStrike's software was primarily used by organisations.[\[18\]](#cite_note-CS_servers_down-18)
 The CrowdStrike software did not provide a way for subscribers to delay the installation of its content files.[\[19\]](#cite_note-19)
 Computers running [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")

### Remedy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Remedy")\
\]

Affected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")
, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike.com-240719-23)

If crashes persisted, remediation required booting into [safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode")
 or the [Windows Recovery Environment](/wiki/Windows_Recovery_Environment "Windows Recovery Environment")
 and deleting any `.sys` file beginning with `C-00000291-` and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the `[%windir%](/wiki/%25windir%25 "%windir%") \[System32](/wiki/Special_folder#File_system_directories "Special folder") \[drivers](/wiki/Driver_(computing) "Driver (computing)") \CrowdStrike\` directory.[\[28\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike_072024-28)
 As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was "expected to take days" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[\[33\]](#cite_note-CSI_1-33)
[\[34\]](#cite_note-HOB_1-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-CSW_1-35)

On devices with Windows' [BitLocker](/wiki/BitLocker "BitLocker")
 disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely.

 After the ground stop left too many crew members in the wrong places, Delta struggled to assemble enough pilots and flight attendants at airport gates to operate scheduled flights.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Yamanouchi3-127)
 Many flights were repeatedly delayed and finally cancelled because the one or two crew members who made it to the gate for a particular flight kept hitting their legal [flight time](/wiki/Flight_time "Flight time")

 On 23 July, Secretary Buttigieg estimated that over 500,000 passengers had been affected by Delta flight cancellations.[\[128\]](#cite_note-Lifsey-128)
 He told a press conference, "There's a lot of things I'm very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours, trying to get a new flight, people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports, unable to get on a flight".[\[129\]](#cite_note-Duncan-129)
 He told [CBS News](/wiki/CBS_News "CBS News")
: "Stories about people in lines of more than a hundred people with just one customer service agent serving them at an airport, that's completely unacceptable."[\[130\]](#cite_note-Picchi-130)
 By then, numerous passengers had ended up in different airports than their baggage because of Delta's flight cancellations, resulting in large piles of unclaimed suitcases and other checked baggage at Delta's airport terminals around the world.[\[131\]](#cite_note-Bondarenko-131)

On 25 July, Delta returned to normal flight operations, having cancelled more than 7,000 flights; passengers had filed more than 5,000 complaints about Delta with the Department of Transportation.[\[132\]](#cite_note-Angel-132)

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

Rob D'Amico, a former FBI supervisory special agent, appears on CNN on Friday, July 19.

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

Flight cancellations into or out of the US have topped 3,000 flights as of 8:40 p.m. “But at that point, the damage had been done, and we now had to move into manual mode.”

In manual mode, it takes a village to reboot computer devices and reload operating systems, DeWalt said, adding some of the companies “spent the entire night deploying thousands of people by hand reloading operating systems, starting servers back up again.”

After discovering the problem wasn’t an attack, but rather a conflict with a Microsoft update that occurred earlier, the group had to race against the clock.

The ongoing global IT outage is impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.

Marriott International has nearly 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, according to the company’s website.

**Impact at other hotels:** An assistant manager at the Hilton Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, said they have been having to manually unlock guests’ rooms because the outage impacted the software the hotel uses to make key cards.  

A CNN team saw guests at the hotel using chairs as doorstoppers to keep their doors from closing when they had to leave.

CNN has reached out to Hilton Hotels for comment.

Businesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.

The outage came as cybersecurity giant [CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-suffers-major-outage-affecting-businesses-around-the-world.html)
 early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is "actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.

"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.

"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again," he wrote.

Over 10,000 Israelis relocate to Canada since early 2024
========================================================

Published :  

15-11-2024 13:13|

[World](/section/4)

Since Oct. 7, 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in the number of "Israelis" seeking to relocate to Canada, "Israeli" newspaper Haaretz reported.

Reports from Canadian immigration authorities show that over 10,000 "Israelis" made the move to Canada in early 2024, with around 8,000 of them obtaining work visas. This marks a significant jump compared to previous years.

While political unrest and escalating violence in the region are major contributors, many "Israelis" cite dissatisfaction with the state of the country’s political system and social inequalities as additional driving forces behind their decision to leave.

Data from the Canadian Ministry of Immigration reveals that between December 2023 and September 2024, a total of 3,425 temporary work visas were approved for "Israelis", out of 3,705 applications.

Moreover, "Israeli" media outlets such as Yedioth Ahronoth reported that even before the aggression on Gaza reached its current intensity, there was a rising trend in the number of "Israelis" choosing to emigrate

Chinese travel agencies have canceled trips to Israel amid the escalated conflict there, which flared up over the weekend. Chinese airlines have adjusted flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.  
   
"We quickly screened all orders after the conflict broke out, and as of now, our company has no tourists stranded in Israel," Tongcheng Travel told the Global Times on Monday morning.   
  
For travel groups planning to travel to Israel in October and November, the company communicated with those clients and processed full refunds. In addition, business work related to tourism in Israel has been temporarily suspended, the agency noted.   
  
GZL International Travel Service told the Global Times that it has decided to cancel all travel groups to Israel in October. It sent two travel groups to the country in September, but both have since returned to China.    
  
Chinese travel agency Spring Tour confirmed to the Global Times that the company has canceled a 28-member tour to Israel that was scheduled to depart on Monday, given the escalated tensions there, and tours departing after that point will be subject to notifications from relevant departments and the actual situation on the ground.  
  
The move came after the escalated conflict there, as Israel's cabinet declared a "state of war" on Sunday against Hamas, in which at least 700 in Israel died while retaliatory Israeli airstrikes killed at least 413 in Gaza, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.  
  
On August 10 , the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the third list of countries, including Israel, to resume outbound group tours.  
   
China's Hainan Airlines, the only carrier in China with flights to Israel, told the Global Times that it canceled flights between Shanghai and Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday due to the ongoing high tensions there, and will adjust flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.   
  
The airline has three direct flights between China and the country, which depart from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, operating twice a week on each route.  
  
Data shared by the information provider VariFlight showed that the flight from Shenzhen to Tel Aviv on Tuesday was canceled.  
  
The airline later said on its official Weibo on Monday afternoon that its follow-up flight plans for Israel routes will continue to be implemented. There has been no adjustment for the time being in an effort to maximize and ensure the normal travel of passengers.  
  
It will pay close attention to changes in the overseas security situation and dynamically adjust relevant flight plans as soon as possible, the airline said.   
  
The Foreign Ministry activated the emergency consular protection mechanism immediately after the conflict broke out to coordinate and engage in work on protecting Chinese nationals and institutions in Palestine and Israel, said Mao Ning, ministry spokesperson, on Monday. The spokesperson reminded Chinese nationals not to travel to Palestine or Israel.   
  
We would like to once again call on relevant parties to immediately stop the fighting, protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. Mao said.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

Content: "![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

Yemen’s [Houthi group](/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide)
 has claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which killed one person and injured at least 10.

A spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media on Friday that the Iran-aligned group had “targeted ‘Tel Aviv’ in occupied Palestine”.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead.

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

The Israeli government has [banned Al Jazeera](/news/2024/5/6/israel-bans-al-jazeera-what-does-it-mean-and-what-happens-next)
 from broadcasting from the country.

“Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting Ben Gurion Airport, and a drone attack on Tel Aviv on the same day. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack.

Following renewed Houthi missile threats, major airlines have extended flight suspensions to Israel, citing escalating security risks near Ben Gurion Airport.

Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militia has again threatened to strike Israel’s main international gateway, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), raising concerns over flight safety and prompting international [airline](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/topic/airlines/)
 responses.

**Details on Houthis’ threats to Israel and Ben Gurion Airport** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer posted a photo of TLV on social media platform X with the warning: “In the coming hours, Yemeni forces will carry out military operations against Ben Gurion and other Zionist airports.” The statement mirrored recent IDF evacuation alerts for Houthi-held Yemeni ports.

The latest threat marks the second in 24 hours. Earlier, Amer warned: “We will strike Ben Gurion Airport in the coming hours. Evacuate immediately.” Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Amer urged international airlines to avoid TLV and Israeli airspace: “They should change course and take seriously the warnings of the Yemeni military… not only over Ben Gurion Airport but over all of Israeli airspace.”

In response, the Israeli Air Force [bombed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7050j07gedo)
 key Houthi infrastructure, including Sanaa Airport (SAH).

Amid the rising threat, several international airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Let’s keep exploring the future of aviation together!

The claim is that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack and a global IT outage on that day, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage or the security concerns.

The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results mention flight cancellations to Israel due to security concerns and Houthi threats to Ben Gurion Airport, as reported by [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-20/ty-article/.premium/delta-suspends-flights-to-israel-until-september-30-which-airlines-are-still-flying/00000191-70ba-d7fc-ab93-f2bf4c4f0000) and the [International Airport Review](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/273457/houthi-threats-to-ben-gurion-airport-spark-fresh-wave-of-airline-suspensions-to-israel-over-safety-fears/). The International Airport Review also mentions a global IT outage. Neither source contains the image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that on July 19, 2024, Ben Gurion Airport experienced a global IT outage and faced threats from the Houthis. The image <image:10255>

## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack and a global IT outage on that day, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage or the security concerns.

`false`
