Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)

," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

Content: "Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, “in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.”

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000.

Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. 22, 2024. 22, 2024.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas," pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct."

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah claimed to have attacked the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided search results do not contain any information about the authenticity of the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine whether the image is authentic. This could be done by comparing the image to other images of the Ramat David airbase or by checking if any news outlets have reported on the image.

Visual forensic analysis suggests that the widely circulated image of the alleged Ramat David Airbase attack is likely AI-generated.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Image: The image is claimed to be from a missile attack on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah.

An image circulating on various platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and Telegram, claims to show the aftermath of an alleged [missile attack](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267)
 on Ramat David Airbase in Israel by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024. (See figure 2)

Figure 2: Visual forensic analysis showing inconsistency and unrealistic depiction of objects.

### Comparison to known incidents and visual evidence

The [Ramat David Airbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_David_Airbase)
 has been a significant target in previous conflicts, such as during the [Second Lebanon War](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/operation-gift)
 and, more recently, in 2024, amidst intensified conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.

Historically, images of the aftermath of attacks on military installations often display recognisable and identifiable military hardware. In contrast, this image presents vehicles that do not match any known military transport or logistical [vehicles used by Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Israel_Defense_Forces)
, the US, or any other military force worldwide.

Additionally, while it is reported that Hezbollah [launched](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)
 missiles at Ramat David on 22 September 2024, no credible visual evidence from trusted news outlets has confirmed the authenticity of the specific image in question. This channel and others play a significant role in circulating unverified or manipulated content, often blurring the line between authentic news and false narratives.

Lastly, upon a detailed visual forensic analysis of the image, it is highly likely that the image showing the aftermath of a supposed missile strike on Ramat David Airbase is AI-generated or significantly manipulated.

The following factors support this conclusion:

*   Unrecognisable vehicles that do not correspond with any existing military models.
*   Blurry and unreadable text on vehicles is typical of AI-generated images.
*   Inconsistent lighting and shadows that do not reflect the real-world impact of a large fire.
*   Symmetrical and uniform flames that lack the chaotic nature of real-world explosions.
*   A blurry background with unnatural transitions between foreground and distant elements.

The reported missile strike by Hezbollah on 22 September 2024 is a real event, but this image does not appear to be an accurate representation of that attack.

I do OSINT research, investigations, and analysis with a love for data visualisation and geospatial magic. The shapes and textures of these vehicles appear artificial, with distorted or unclear outlines that make it difficult to identify any specific model used by military forces around the world.

Typically, airbases, particularly one as strategic as Ramat David, house well-documented vehicle types, including fuel trucks, maintenance vehicles, and armoured transport. In this image, however, none of the vehicles can be compared to existing models, which raises suspicion about the image’s authenticity. A thorough analysis reveals that the image, widely shared on social media platforms, appears to be AI-generated or manipulated for the following reasons.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

Figure 1: Social media accounts amplify the AI-generated image with thousands of impressions on X and Reddit.

Visual forensic analysis
------------------------

*   _Vehicles appear unrecognisable_

A significant red flag in the image is the unrecognisability of the vehicles shown. (See figure 2)

*   _Blurry text on vehicles_

One of the most prominent signs of AI-generated imagery is blurry or indecipherable text. This is a hallmark of AI manipulation, as text is often poorly rendered in AI-generated images."

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

 circulating on social media. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic."

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Content: "<image:12095>!Reuters A distressed-looking woman draped in an Israeli flag holds another person (20/02/25) <image:12096>Reuters

Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv mourned the return of the bodies

On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading.

The return of the dead.

It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days.

Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put.

But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

Missile casings bore the slogan: "They were killed by US bombs". In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion.

Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away.

The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain.

After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi.

A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place.

Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters.

In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre.

All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023.

Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands.

The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. <image:12095>!EPA Red Cross vehicle drives through lines of Palestinians in Khan Younis, Gaza (20/02/25) <image:12098>EPA

Some Gaza expressed bitterness that bodies of Israelis had been released

Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified.

As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri.

"We were devastated by the news," Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir.

"I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."

Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023.

Oded was 84 years old at the time."

Content: "(Noam Lehmann/Times of Israel)

About 300 people are marching from Tel Aviv’s Habima Square to the IDF headquarters on Begin Street to demand a ceasefire deal in Gaza to free hostages, kicking off a fifth straight night of protests after the IDF said Sunday it had recovered the bodies of six Israelis in Hamas hands slain days earlier.

The group carries 27 mock coffins, representing 27 hostages killed in captivity in Gaza.

Speaking ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the six slain hostages whose remains were recovered over the weekend, accuses Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shout: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann says, noting the number of days she was held captive. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo): 
Content: "After almost 10 months of simmering conflict, the prospect of an all-out war scares many.

When Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s hardline finance minister, arrives, the crowd swells and the sense of anger mounts.

He’s accosted by angry locals. Many people are simply standing by the crater, taking in the scene, lost in thought.

In the corner of the pitch, someone has tried to remove the bloodstains on the astroturf, but with only limited success.

Outside the fence, bicycles and scooters lie scattered, all blackened from yesterday’s brief but devastating fireball.

There’s a bomb shelter metres away, but when the siren sounded last night, the children had mere seconds to respond. They had absolutely no chance.

Israel says the rocket was fired from Shebaa, a small village just a short distance away across the western flank of Mt Hermon, which towers over Majdal Shams.

Hezbollah disputes Israel’s claim, but around the time the rocket landed here, its media outlets announced that it had fired rockets towards an Israeli military base less than two miles from the football pitch.

Golan Heights strike: 'The whole town is mourning'

Golan Heights strike: 'There was a siren, but no-one had time to react'

The scene around the football pitch here in Majdal Shams, where 12 children and young people died on Saturday, is quiet and deeply sombre.

There are plenty of people here - local Druze elders in their distinctive red and white turbans and baggy trousers, military officials, visiting government ministers and of course many journalists.

Residents fear all-out war after an strike on a football pitch killed 12 children in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights

This is a day of funerals for those who died here, most of them boys and girls between 10 and 16. Some are demanding a decisive response against Hezbollah. Some accuse the government of abandoning the Golan Heights.

Thousands gathered in the streets on Sunday for the funerals of the young people who were killed in the strike

The people of Majdal Shams are used to the sound of rockets overhead, but Saturday’s attack took them all by surprise.

“I don’t think the government needs to respond,” Nassar says. They don’t need more war,” another says.

CNN  — 

Israel vowed Hezbollah will “pay the price” after blaming the Lebanese militant group for [a rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/lebanon-israel-golan-strikes-intl-latam/index.html)
 that killed 12 children, touching off fears once again that an all-out war would envelop the region.

Hezbollah says it “firmly denies” it was behind the strike, the deadliest to hit Israel or Israeli-controlled territory since the October 7 attacks.

Israeli warplanes conducted airstrikes against Hezbollah targets “deep inside Lebanese territory” and along the border overnight Sunday, according to a [statement](https://t.me/idfofficial/9222)
 from the military on Sunday morning. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from those strikes.

And on a visit to the town of Majdal Shams near the Syrian and Lebanese borders, where the rocket attack left children and teenagers dead on Saturday, Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant pledged a heavy response.

“Hezbollah is responsible for this and they will pay the price,” Gallant said. In an earlier statement from his office, he added: “We will hit the enemy hard.”

The Saturday attacks on the region involved “approximately 30 projectiles” crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory, in a barrage Israel’s military quickly blamed on the Iran-backed militant group.

It killed 12 children and left 44 people injured, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.

The children killed in the strike had been playing on a soccer field, according to a list from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and residents who spoke to CNN. Smotrich was eventually ushered away by security.

Fears of wider war spread
-------------------------

Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire on a near-daily basis since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7, and those exchanges have become increasingly volatile, sparking fears on several occasions that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza would spiral into a conflict on multiple fronts across the Middle East.

While Hezbollah admitted striking the Golan Heights on Saturday, it rejected responsibility for the attack on Majdal Shams.

“We confirm that the Islamic Resistance has no connection to the incident whatsoever and firmly denies all false claims in this regard,” a statement read.

Analysing footage of the explosion and the aftermath, experts told CNN the blast and damage were consistent with the types of munitions fired at northern Israel and the Golan Heights from Lebanon and Syria.

Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told CNN Sunday that weapon fragments at the scene indicated the rocket was fired by Hezbollah or another militant group. His office said following the meeting that the cabinet had “authorized the prime minister and the minister of defense to decide on the nature of the response against the terror organization Hezbollah, and on its’ timing.”

The prime minister said earlier that he was “shocked” by the attack. Throughout the 34-day war, Hezbollah is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets – a daily average of 117.

Bou Habib stressed that another war would not only be detrimental to Lebanon, but to Israel as well.

“\[Israel\] will return to the stone ages as well, it’s not by the Lebanese government,” he said, referring to comments by Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant back in June 2023, in which he said the Israeli military could send Lebanon “back to the Stone Age.”

However, Bou Habib told the Lebanese Al Jadeed News TV channel that Lebanon had received reassurances from third countries that Israel’s response would be “limited.” He added that Hezbollah would in turn limit its actions. Pressed by the anchor to identify the countries that had offered this reassurance, he hinted that the “US and France are very concerned about the issue.”

Lebanon has called for an international investigation into the attack to determine who was responsible.

What happened early Sunday?
---------------------------

The situation between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group remains tense. Flights that were already en route to Ben Gurion were diverted to other airports.

Israel's Home Front Command raised the alert level in northern Israel and encouraged people to stay near bomb shelters.

This photo taken from a position in northern Israel shows a Hezbollah UAV intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over north Israel on Aug. Soon after, Hezbollah announced it launched an attack on Israeli military positions with a large number of drones. Two other soldiers were "lightly and moderately injured," Israel said.

"Approximately ninety percent of the targets struck were short-range rockets aimed at northern Israel," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a statement on Sunday, adding, "Hezbollah planned to harm Israeli civilians."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking at the start of a Cabinet meeting, said the military had eliminated "thousands of rockets that were aimed at northern Israel" and urged citizens to adhere to directives from the Home Front Command.

"We are determined to do everything to defend our country, to return the residents of the north securely to their homes and to continue upholding a simple rule: Whoever harms us — we will harm them," he said.

What was involved in the attack
-------------------------------

Lt. "Most of them either fell on their way to Israeli territory, landed in open areas, or were intercepted by Israeli Air Force defense systems and Israeli Navy ships."

Hezbollah said its attack involved more than 320 Katyusha rockets aimed at multiple sites in Israel and a "large number" of drones. It said the operation was targeting "a qualitative Israeli military target that will be announced later" as well as "enemy sites and barracks and Iron Dome (missile defense) platforms."

Hezbollah later announced the end of what it said was the first stage of retaliatory strikes, which it said would allow it to launch more attacks deeper into Israel. was preparing](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-says-potential-iran-hezbollah-israel-attack-this-week/)

The attacks come as delegations from the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt [are holding another round of cease-fire talks in Cairo](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-strikes-gaza-cease-fire-talks/)
.

A spokesman for the National Security Council, Sean Savett, said President Biden was "closely monitoring" the events in Israel and Lebanon and that he has been engaged with his national security team throughout the evening.

Key Points

*   Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones against Israel on Sunday in retaliation for the assassination of a senior commander in Beirut last month.
*   Hezbollah said it had launched more than 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets.
*   Israeli jets hit targets in Lebanon shortly before the strikes as the military assessed that Hezbollah was preparing to begin the barrage, the military said.

Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel's military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a bigger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.

Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapor trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.

The extent of damage was not immediately clear and Hezbollah indicated it was not planning further strikes yet, while Israel's Foreign Minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war.

Any major escalation in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah's backer Iran and Israel's main ally the United States.

Sunday's strikes came as negotiators were meeting in Cairo in a last-ditch effort to conclude a halt to the fighting in Gaza.

The Iran-backed Lebanese group said it had fired 320 Katyusha rockets towards Israel and hit 11 military targets in what it called the first phase of its retaliation for Israel's assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander, last month.

Israel's military said it had foiled a much larger attack with pre-emptive airstrikes after assessing that Hezbollah was preparing to launch the barrage, using 100 jets to strike more than 40 Hezbollah launch sites in southern Lebanon.

The strikes destroyed thousands of launcher barrels, aimed mostly at northern Israel but also targeting some central areas, Israel's military said.

Hezbollah dismissed Israel's statement that the group's attack had been foiled with pre-emptive strikes, saying it had been able to launch its drones as planned and that the rest of its response to Shukr's killing would take "some time".

Israel's Army Radio, citing defense officials, said the military assessed that the Hezbollah barrage on northern Israel was "improvised" after the pre-emptive strike by Israeli jets on the Hezbollah launch sites.

President Joe Biden was following events closely, the White House said.

"At his direction, senior U.S. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was on high alert all over the country.

The Israeli military issued civil defense instructions from central Israel to the north, limiting gatherings but authorizing people to go to work as long as they were able to reach air raid shelters quickly. There were no casualties immediately reported in Israel, according to the ambulance service.

Israeli media said the barrage hitting northern areas had damaged some houses and a chicken coop.

A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country's south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.

One of the strikes on the town of Khiam killed one fighter from the Hezbollah-allied Shi'ite group Amal, two security sources told Reuters. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah will speak on television later on Sunday, the group said.

The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the U.N.'s special coordinator's office in the country called on all sides to cease fire, calling the developments overnight "worrying".

Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youngsters and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.

Warning sirens
--------------

In northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and multiple explosions were heard around several areas as Israel's Iron Dome aerial defense system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon. We will keep supporting Israel's right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability," said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett.

Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.

That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollah's most senior military commanders.

Shukr's death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisal against Israel by Iran."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

JERUSALEM — Israel and Hezbollah on Sunday exchanged their heaviest strikes since the Gaza war began in October, with Israeli war planes bombing sites across southern Lebanon and Hezbollah firing a barrage of drones and rockets across the border — a dramatic but contained escalation that stopped short of all-out war.

The CNBC article ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/25/hezbollah-launches-missile-barrage-at-israel-to-avenge-top-commander.html)) details a Hezbollah missile barrage against Israel.

None of the articles mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. <image:12174>, <image:12173>, <image:12189>, <image:12133>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm escalating tensions and attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, they do not mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm that there were attacks between Israel and Hezbollah on August 25, 2024, and that Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024. However, the search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter during the August 25 attacks. The image's context is also not confirmed.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, second left, and Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan, left, stand in a structure in the area of the former settlement of Sa-Nur in the northern West Bank, August 7, 2025. The two-word phrase, written in blue on the column on the photo's right, reads 'Death to Arabs.' (Roei Hadi/Samaria Regional Council)

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Thursday disavowed the slogan “Death to Arabs” after being photographed next to the graffitied phrase during a tour of the northern West Bank, in which he vowed to rebuild the settlement of Sa-Nur that was evacuated decades ago.

Smotrich, who also serves as a minister in the Defense Ministry, was photographed next to the slogan as he visited the site to mark 20 years since it and the nearby settlement Homesh were dismantled as part of Israel’s 2005 Disengagement Plan. The plan also saw Israel evacuate the Gaza Strip’s Gush Katif settlement bloc, which Smotrich has called on Israel to rebuild as well amid the war in Gaza.

Following online criticism of the photograph, Smotrich’s office said in a statement that the offending phrase was noticed only “after the photo was distributed, and of course we completely disavow it.”

Smotrich’s office said the media shouldn’t be concerned by “stupid graffiti that no one noticed,” but by the minister’s drive to “reverse the expulsion from northern Samaria and resettle Sa-Nur.”

The photograph was included in a press release by the Samaria Regional Council, which oversees settlers’ municipal affairs in the northern West Bank. Council head Yossi Dagan, who also appeared in the photo, later sent out a second press release with the “Death to Arabs” graffiti cropped out of the picture, without apologizing for the phrase or explaining the reason for the edit.

Opposition Leader Yair Lapid slammed Smotrich on X: “Aside from the moral issue, what in God’s name does the government expect us to say to the world when a photo is published of a senior minister smiling next to the inscription ‘Death to Arabs’?”

[! “That applies to Gaza, and it’s even more true here.”

The Palestinian Authority issued a strong condemnation of Smotrich’s visit, saying it was part of “plans to entrench the gradual annexation of the West Bank, posing a direct threat to the possibility of implementing the two-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In a statement, the PA foreign ministry said the push “to revive settlements that were evacuated 20 years ago” would lead to further confiscation of Palestinian lands.

Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed in May that Israel had approved the construction of 22 new West Bank settlements, including Sa-Nur and Homesh.

Israeli NGO Peace Now, which monitors settlement activity in the West Bank, said some of the 22 settlements the government announced as new had already existed on the ground.

Some are neighborhoods that were upgraded to independent settlements, and others are unrecognized outposts given formal status under Israeli law, according to Peace Now.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`

None of the articles mention Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich or his presence in a bomb shelter. <image:12174>, <image:12173>, <image:12189>, <image:12133>


## Elaboration

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC News article ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clwy598dyezo)) discusses a strike on a football pitch in the Golan Heights on July 28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. It mentions Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich visiting the site. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams_attack)) details the Majdal Shams attack on July 27, 2024, during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict, which resulted in the deaths of 12 Syrian Druze children. It also mentions Smotrich's visit. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/middleeast/israel-hezbollah-golan-heights-soccer-strikes-intl)) reports on a rocket attack in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children and mentions Smotrich's presence at the site. <image:12133>, <image:12134>, <image:12136>, <image:10246>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich was present at the site of a rocket attack in the Golan Heights on July 27-28, 2024, where 12 children were killed. The search results do not mention Smotrich taking shelter in a bomb shelter or any attacks on August 25, 2024. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the available information.

The evidence does not provide any information about the context of the image, including the date or location. The image itself does not confirm the claim.

To verify the claim, information about the date and location of the image, as well as confirmation of Smotrich's presence in a bomb shelter during a Hezbollah attack on August 25, 2024, is needed.

**An Algerian judoka has been disqualified after failing the weigh-in before facing an Israeli opponent at the Olympic Games.**

Messaoud Redouane Dris, 22, had been scheduled to face Tohar Butbul in the -73kg category on Monday.

However, Dris weighed in above the 73kg limit ahead of the contest and was removed from the draw.

Games organisers confirmed his disqualification and awarded Butbul a walkover to the next round.

Algeria's judo federation and national Olympic committee are yet to comment.

The Israeli Olympic Committee alleged his failure to compete had been deliberate and was strongly critical of the Algerian.

"Tohar's competitor has removed himself from the competition," the Israeli body said in a statement.

"The Israeli delegation will continue to compete with the Olympic values in mind, we believe this kind of behaviour has no place in the world of sport."

Another Algerian judoka, Fethi Nourine, was [handed a 10-year ban](/sport/olympics/58556940)
 by the International Judo Federation after withdrawing from a bout against Butbul at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

In that specific case, Nourine said at the time that his political support for the Palestinian cause made it impossible for him to compete.

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 1 year old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

Drone strikes Tel Aviv, killing one. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The Houthis say they are acting to show solidarity with the Palestinians over the war in Gaza, though the civilian shipping traffic involves vessels from around the world.

Tel Aviv came under heavy rocket fire from Hamas in the early weeks of the war last fall, but the attacks have long since stopped. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. <image:12306>

Israeli police investigate the scene of a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel on Friday. But this attack apparently caught Israeli forces off-guard.

Sirens typically provide a warning when Tel Aviv or other cities come under aerial attack. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. Hamas occasionally fires rockets into southern Israel.

The main aerial threat to Israel has been coming from the north, with Hezbollah and Israel trading rocket fire across the border on a daily basis.

 in the Red Sea. The attacks came after the latest in a series of lulls in Houthi attacks on shipping – halts that, in the past, led to speculation that the [Houthi weapons arsenals](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-january-22/)
 might be running low.

The Houthi strike on Tel Aviv has moved the group from the margins of the Gaza conflict to the center of diplomacy and the allied strategy to try to end the fighting permanently. and its allies have used to try to end the Houthi strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have failed to deter the group.
*   The Houthis’ ability to continue striking targets in and around Yemen suggests their missile and drone arsenal was more extensive than was believed and the group might still be receiving resupply from Iran.
*   Israel’s retaliation on an oil refinery at Hodeidah could complicate U.S.-led efforts to contain the Houthi threat and potentially expand regional warfare even further.

**The threat to regional peace and security posed by the [Houthi movement (Ansarallah)](https://thesoufancenter.org/intelbrief-2024-june-11/)
 in Yemen expanded Friday when the group launched an explosive-laden drone on Tel Aviv in the pre-dawn hours, striking an apartment building and killing an Israeli man while wounding several others.** The drone reportedly flew near the U.S. forces but later assessed the attack was by Israel, and quoted Yemen’s Health Ministry as reporting the strike had killed and wounded several persons.

The Houthi attack on Tel Aviv demonstrated that U.S. The Houthi attacks have reduced commercial ship traffic by nearly half, but otherwise produced no measurable effect on Israeli, U.S., or global policy on the Gaza war or the broader region.

The Tel Aviv drone strike came days after the Houthis demonstrated they still have an ample and varied supply of weaponry in their arsenal. escalation against the Houthis has the potential to further expand the Gaza crisis into a regional conflagration.

**Bottom Line up Front**

*   On Friday, the Houthi movement in Yemen sought to implement its threats against Israel by conducting a strike on Tel Aviv with an Iranian-made long-range drone.
*   The diplomatic, military, and economic tools the U.S. Two attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted ships in the Red Sea on July 15, even as the U.S. The spokesman said that Tel Aviv will continue to be a primary target for the terror group “within the range of our weapons.”

The attack rattled the Israeli security establishment, which has prided itself on fielding the most sophisticated missile, rocket, and drone defense in the region, if not the world."

FSWC Calls for Canadians to Stand with Israel

**Statement from FSWC**

**Toronto (October 7, 2023)** - Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center (FSWC) is devastated by today’s horrific news from Israel concerning the many Israelis killed or wounded in the murderous, multi-front assault by Hamas terrorists.

We extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the families of those killed in this abhorrent, unprovoked attack on civilians. We express our wishes for a full and speedy recovery to those wounded and pray for the safe return of all those kidnapped and taken to Gaza as hostages by the Hamas invaders.

We condemn, in the harshest terms, the actions of Palestinian terror groups in firing thousands of rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets in Israel and massacring residents in numerous villages and towns, actions that constitute heinous war crimes that shouldn’t go unpunished.

FSWC thanks senior police officials in Toronto, York and Peel regions after they informed us that they have devoted additional resources to ensure the safety and security of Jewish residents and Jewish community institutions given the antisemitic attacks that took place two years ago in Toronto during the last major conflict between Israel and Palestinian terror groups in Gaza.

**FSWC President and CEO Michael Levitt issued the following statement:**

“We appreciate the strong support for Israel already expressed by leaders in our country, including the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and many others at all levels of government and many community organizations. We call on all Canadians to stand in solidarity with Israel, to unequivocally condemn today’s appalling attacks against Israelis and to speak out against the actions of the Palestinian terrorists and those who support them, including their backers in Iran.”

The claim that the image shows the aftermath of a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv in July 2024 is false. The reverse image search reveals that the image was published in October 2023, in the context of the Hamas attack on Israel.


## Final Judgement
The image is not related to a Houthi attack in July 2024. The image was published in October 2023, in the context of the Hamas attack on Israel.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image in the claim was published in October 2023, and is related to the Hamas attack on Israel, not a Houthi attack in July 2024. The reverse image search results show the image was used in news articles from October 2023, such as the one from the [Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center](https://www.fswc.ca/news/fswc-calls-for-canadians-to-stand-with-israel).

 Computers running [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")

### Remedy

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Remedy")\
\]

Affected machines could be restored by rebooting while connected to the network; ideally while connected to [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet")
, thus providing the opportunity to download the reverted channel file, with multiple reboots reportedly required.[\[31\]](#cite_note-31)
[\[23\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike.com-240719-23)

If crashes persisted, remediation required booting into [safe mode](/wiki/Safe_mode "Safe mode")
 or the [Windows Recovery Environment](/wiki/Windows_Recovery_Environment "Windows Recovery Environment")
 and deleting any `.sys` file beginning with `C-00000291-` and with timestamp 04:09 UTC in the `[%windir%](/wiki/%25windir%25 "%windir%") \[System32](/wiki/Special_folder#File_system_directories "Special folder") \[drivers](/wiki/Driver_(computing) "Driver (computing)") \CrowdStrike\` directory.[\[28\]](#cite_note-crowdstrike_072024-28)
 As this process needed to be done locally on each individual machine, it was "expected to take days" for affected businesses to restore all systems.[\[32\]](#cite_note-32)
 Technical staff needed to reboot the affected computers individually with manual intervention on each system.[\[33\]](#cite_note-CSI_1-33)
[\[34\]](#cite_note-HOB_1-34)
[\[35\]](#cite_note-CSW_1-35)

On devices with Windows' [BitLocker](/wiki/BitLocker "BitLocker")
 disk encryption enabled, which corporations often use to increase security, fixing the problem was exacerbated because the 48-digit numeric Bitlocker recovery keys (unique to each system) required manual input, with additional challenges supplying the recovery keys to end users working remotely.

 After the ground stop left too many crew members in the wrong places, Delta struggled to assemble enough pilots and flight attendants at airport gates to operate scheduled flights.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Yamanouchi3-127)
 Many flights were repeatedly delayed and finally cancelled because the one or two crew members who made it to the gate for a particular flight kept hitting their legal [flight time](/wiki/Flight_time "Flight time")
 limit before the airline could finish fully staffing the flight, and this caused the crisis to snowball as those crew and their aircraft were now in the wrong place for the following day's flights.[\[127\]](#cite_note-Yamanouchi3-127)

 On 23 July, Secretary Buttigieg estimated that over 500,000 passengers had been affected by Delta flight cancellations.[\[128\]](#cite_note-Lifsey-128)
 He told a press conference, "There's a lot of things I'm very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours, trying to get a new flight, people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports, unable to get on a flight".[\[129\]](#cite_note-Duncan-129)
 He told [CBS News](/wiki/CBS_News "CBS News")
: "Stories about people in lines of more than a hundred people with just one customer service agent serving them at an airport, that's completely unacceptable."[\[130\]](#cite_note-Picchi-130)
 By then, numerous passengers had ended up in different airports than their baggage because of Delta's flight cancellations, resulting in large piles of unclaimed suitcases and other checked baggage at Delta's airport terminals around the world.[\[131\]](#cite_note-Bondarenko-131)

On 25 July, Delta returned to normal flight operations, having cancelled more than 7,000 flights; passengers had filed more than 5,000 complaints about Delta with the Department of Transportation.[\[132\]](#cite_note-Angel-132)
 On 26 July, _The Washington Post_ reported that the department was investigating allegedly misleading communications from Delta that offered only credit towards future Delta flights as compensation for cancelled flights and failed to clearly notify passengers of their legal right to a cash refund.[\[129\]](#cite_note-Duncan-129)

On 31 July, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the disruption had cost the airline $500 million, and he said that Delta would sue CrowdStrike to recoup some of its losses.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)

The CEO of CrowdStrike promised customers “full transparency” on how the global IT outage involving the company’s software occurred.

George Kurtz said on Friday that CrowdStrike would take steps “to prevent anything like this from happening again,” according to a statement on the company’s website.

“We have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams” to recover from the outage, the embattled CEO told customers.

**But that could be easier said than done:** Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don’t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage.

“All of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation,” Kurtz added.

“We are working on a technical update and root cause analysis that we will share with everyone as well,” Kurtz said in a separate post on X Friday afternoon.

Rob D'Amico, a former FBI supervisory special agent, appears on CNN on Friday, July 19.

A former FBI supervisory special agent said the national security implications of today’s global computer outage are “bigger than most people think.”

Rob D’Amico said that nation-state cyber actors — otherwise known as adversaries with maliciously targeted cyber activity, according to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors)
 — are likely keeping track of what happened during the tech disruption.

He added that another national security issue could be cyber actors potentially taking advantage of the outage by attempting phishing cyberattacks.

CrowdStrike, the company behind the tech disruption, said [in a statement](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/)
 Friday that “this was not a cyberattack” and that the company’s team “is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.”

D’Amico said he is skeptical of the firm saying the debacle was not a security incident.

Flight cancellations into or out of the US have topped 3,000 flights as of 8:40 p.m. “But at that point, the damage had been done, and we now had to move into manual mode.”

In manual mode, it takes a village to reboot computer devices and reload operating systems, DeWalt said, adding some of the companies “spent the entire night deploying thousands of people by hand reloading operating systems, starting servers back up again.”

After discovering the problem wasn’t an attack, but rather a conflict with a Microsoft update that occurred earlier, the group had to race against the clock.

The ongoing global IT outage is impacting major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hilton hotels.

Marriott International has nearly 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, according to the company’s website.

**Impact at other hotels:** An assistant manager at the Hilton Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, said they have been having to manually unlock guests’ rooms because the outage impacted the software the hotel uses to make key cards.  

A CNN team saw guests at the hotel using chairs as doorstoppers to keep their doors from closing when they had to leave.

Businesses worldwide grappled with an ongoing major IT outage Friday, as financial services and doctors' offices were disrupted, while some TV broadcasters went offline. Air travel has been hit particularly hard, with planes grounded, services delayed and airports issuing advice to passengers.

The outage came as cybersecurity giant [CrowdStrike experienced a major disruption](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-suffers-major-outage-affecting-businesses-around-the-world.html)
 early Friday following an issue with a recent tech update.

CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz has since said that the company is "actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts," stressing that Mac and Linux hosts are not affected.

"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. He emphasized again that the outage was not caused by a security breach or cyberattack.

"As we resolve this incident, you have my commitment to provide full transparency on how this occurred and steps we're taking to prevent anything like this from happening again," he wrote.

.

According to correspondence obtained by CNBC, Tesla's IT teams notified employees that there was a "windows host outage," and different systems were affected including "servers, laptops and manufacturing devices." The IT teams informed Tesla employees that they may see a "[blue screen](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/microsoft-says-it-restored-cloud-services-after-they-suffered-outage.html)
" on their various devices.

Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)
, who also owns social media platform X, posted several complaints about the CrowdStrike outages to his account, which has more than 190 million followers, throughout the morning.

Two Tesla employees who spoke with CNBC, but asked to remain unnamed because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the company, said that some manufacturing lines were slow to start on Friday morning, and others were temporarily halted in California and Nevada."

Over 10,000 Israelis relocate to Canada since early 2024
========================================================

Published :  

15-11-2024 13:13|

[World](/section/4)

Since Oct. 7, 2023, there has been a noticeable surge in the number of "Israelis" seeking to relocate to Canada, "Israeli" newspaper Haaretz reported.

Reports from Canadian immigration authorities show that over 10,000 "Israelis" made the move to Canada in early 2024, with around 8,000 of them obtaining work visas. This marks a significant jump compared to previous years.

While political unrest and escalating violence in the region are major contributors, many "Israelis" cite dissatisfaction with the state of the country’s political system and social inequalities as additional driving forces behind their decision to leave.

Data from the Canadian Ministry of Immigration reveals that between December 2023 and September 2024, a total of 3,425 temporary work visas were approved for "Israelis", out of 3,705 applications.

Moreover, "Israeli" media outlets such as Yedioth Ahronoth reported that even before the aggression on Gaza reached its current intensity, there was a rising trend in the number of "Israelis" choosing to emigrate

Chinese travel agencies have canceled trips to Israel amid the escalated conflict there, which flared up over the weekend. Chinese airlines have adjusted flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.  
   
"We quickly screened all orders after the conflict broke out, and as of now, our company has no tourists stranded in Israel," Tongcheng Travel told the Global Times on Monday morning.   
  
For travel groups planning to travel to Israel in October and November, the company communicated with those clients and processed full refunds. In addition, business work related to tourism in Israel has been temporarily suspended, the agency noted.   
  
GZL International Travel Service told the Global Times that it has decided to cancel all travel groups to Israel in October. It sent two travel groups to the country in September, but both have since returned to China.    
  
Chinese travel agency Spring Tour confirmed to the Global Times that the company has canceled a 28-member tour to Israel that was scheduled to depart on Monday, given the escalated tensions there, and tours departing after that point will be subject to notifications from relevant departments and the actual situation on the ground.  
  
The move came after the escalated conflict there, as Israel's cabinet declared a "state of war" on Sunday against Hamas, in which at least 700 in Israel died while retaliatory Israeli airstrikes killed at least 413 in Gaza, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Monday.  
  
On August 10 , the Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the third list of countries, including Israel, to resume outbound group tours.  
   
China's Hainan Airlines, the only carrier in China with flights to Israel, told the Global Times that it canceled flights between Shanghai and Tel Aviv, Israel, on Monday due to the ongoing high tensions there, and will adjust flight arrangements in line with security conditions on the ground.   
  
The airline has three direct flights between China and the country, which depart from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, operating twice a week on each route.  
  
Data shared by the information provider VariFlight showed that the flight from Shenzhen to Tel Aviv on Tuesday was canceled.  
  
The airline later said on its official Weibo on Monday afternoon that its follow-up flight plans for Israel routes will continue to be implemented. There has been no adjustment for the time being in an effort to maximize and ensure the normal travel of passengers.  
  
It will pay close attention to changes in the overseas security situation and dynamically adjust relevant flight plans as soon as possible, the airline said.   
  
The Foreign Ministry activated the emergency consular protection mechanism immediately after the conflict broke out to coordinate and engage in work on protecting Chinese nationals and institutions in Palestine and Israel, said Mao Ning, ministry spokesperson, on Monday. The spokesperson reminded Chinese nationals not to travel to Palestine or Israel.   
  
We would like to once again call on relevant parties to immediately stop the fighting, protect civilians and avoid further deterioration of the situation. Mao said.

A global malfunction Friday on Microsoft’s Windows operating system, apparently linked to the IT security firm CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform, caused outages at banks, airlines, news outlets, health systems and other organizations around the world.

“This is a worldwide issue on systems connected to a cybersecurity software, and not a local Israeli event,” Yoram HaCohen, who heads the Israel Internet Association told the Ynet news site.

HaCohen said that the problem appeared to be connected to a recent CrowdStrike software update, but cautioned it was too early to say “with certainty” that it was the product of a good-faith error rather than a malicious event.

In Israel, the Health Ministry said the outage impacted more than a dozen hospitals in Israel, including Shaare Zedek in Jerusalem, Laniado in Netanya, Barzilai in Ashkelon, Wolfson in Holon and a number of others, as well as the healthcare provider Meuhedet.

The affected hospitals were operating on a manual basis, as their digital services are inaccessible, the ministry said, stressing that patient care is not affected, and the hospitals are prepared for such an outage following drills.

Ambulances were nevertheless told to take patients to unaffected hospitals, the ministry noted.

The ministry also warned that Israelis could have trouble calling the country’s medical emergency line, and advised that people call the police instead if they couldn’t get through — but noted that there had been no problems on the line so far.

Pharmacies also reported problems receiving some prescriptions from state healthcare providers, the Haaretz newspaper reported.

Meanwhile, the outage disrupted air travel around the world.

Ben Gurion Airport did not appear to be directly affected but was expected to see some impact from flights being canceled, delayed, or diverted as a result of problems elsewhere.

[! In contrast, US airlines Delta, United, Allegiant, and American all grounded their flights, and three Indian airlines also reported extensive IT disruptions.

Meanwhile, Berlin’s airport halted all flights, while the Spanish airport operator said that all airports in that country were affected, and problems were reported at other European airports as well.

Israel Electric Corporation’s call center was also down amid the outage, and the Port of Ashdod said in a statement that all service for trucks and ships was suspended as technicians examined the issue.

Content: "![People gather at the scene of an deadly explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel, early Friday, July 19, 2024. They \[the government\] have to go,” the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party wrote on X.

The Houthis have repeatedly launched drones and missiles towards Israel and at Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in a show of support for Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza.

Until the early morning attack on Friday, all attempts to hit Israel by the Houthis were intercepted by either Israeli defences or Western allies with forces stationed in the region, The Associated Press news agency reported.

[Hezbollah in southern Lebanon](/news/2024/7/17/hezbollah-threatens-to-fire-on-new-israeli-targets)
 has also stepped up attacks against military targets in northern Israel, saying they are also acting in solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed almost 39,000 people.

Following the latest drone attack, Hezbollah welcomed the development as “a triumph for the oppression of the Palestinian people and their fighters”.

It said the Yemeni fighters were supporting “the heroic” Palestinian fighters in Gaza who in turn are defending “all our people and countries of our Arab and Islamic nations”.

The group said the fight will not stop until “the aggression and the siege of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”.

The Palestinian Mujahideen Movement also praised the Houthi rebels for “a new heroic operation” against Israel, adding that Palestinians appreciated the “steadfast” support of Gaza.

Yemen’s [Houthi group](/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide)
 has claimed responsibility for an apparent drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, which killed one person and injured at least 10.

A spokesperson for the Houthi armed forces said in a post on social media on Friday that the Iran-aligned group had “targeted ‘Tel Aviv’ in occupied Palestine”.

It claimed that it used a new drone “capable of bypassing interceptor systems and being unable to be detected by radars”.

The Israeli military said it had opened an investigation into the large explosion near the United States embassy office in the city and would determine why the country’s air defence systems were not activated to intercept the “aerial target”.

“We’re talking about a large UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] that can fly large distances,” a military official told a briefing for journalists following the strike. Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels on July 19, claimed responsibility for a drone attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv, where police said one person was found dead.

Israel’s air force has increased patrols to “protect the country’s skies”, the military said in a post on social media.

Israel’s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant promised retaliation.

“We will settle the score with anyone who harms the State of Israel or directs terror against it,” Israeli Army Radio quoted Gallant as saying.

Israeli police said the body of a man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and that the circumstances were being investigated.

Footage from the site of the blast showed broken glass strewn across pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. The site was sealed off by police tape.

Reporting from Doha, Qatar, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom said the attack has created a new wave of anxiety in Israel.

The Israeli government has [banned Al Jazeera](/news/2024/5/6/israel-bans-al-jazeera-what-does-it-mean-and-what-happens-next)
 from broadcasting from the country.

“Where this drone hit is a part of the city that is very close to the US embassy branch office. It’s a very densely populated area, a high-security area,” Jamjoom said.

If the drone is confirmed to be Houthi and passed through Israel’s radar systems undetected, “there’s going to be a lot of people in Israel concerned about what this means”, said Jamjoom.

“How did this happen at a time when the country is under such high alert?”

Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said they will continue to assess the drone attack in the coming days to adjust its defences and decide on a suitable “offensive response”.

Israeli opposition politician Yair Lapid said the attack was “further proof that this government does not know and cannot give security to the citizens of Israel”.

“Those who lose deterrence in the north and south also lose it in the heart of Tel Aviv."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The search results confirm a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting Ben Gurion Airport, and a drone attack on Tel Aviv on the same day. However, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage, but there is no evidence to support the claim that it shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthi attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

Following renewed Houthi missile threats, major airlines have extended flight suspensions to Israel, citing escalating security risks near Ben Gurion Airport.

Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi militia has again threatened to strike Israel’s main international gateway, Ben Gurion Airport (TLV), raising concerns over flight safety and prompting international [airline](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/topic/airlines/)
 responses.

**Details on Houthis’ threats to Israel and Ben Gurion Airport** 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On Monday, senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer posted a photo of TLV on social media platform X with the warning: “In the coming hours, Yemeni forces will carry out military operations against Ben Gurion and other Zionist airports.” The statement mirrored recent IDF evacuation alerts for Houthi-held Yemeni ports.

The latest threat marks the second in 24 hours. Earlier, Amer warned: “We will strike Ben Gurion Airport in the coming hours. Evacuate immediately.” Speaking to Al Mayadeen, Amer urged international airlines to avoid TLV and Israeli airspace: “They should change course and take seriously the warnings of the Yemeni military… not only over Ben Gurion Airport but over all of Israeli airspace.”

In response, the Israeli Air Force [bombed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7050j07gedo)
 key Houthi infrastructure, including Sanaa Airport (SAH).

Amid the rising threat, several international airlines have suspended flights to Israel. Let’s keep exploring the future of aviation together!

The claim is that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack and a global IT outage on that day, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage or the security concerns.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:10255> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
web_search("airport crowd after attack July 19 2024")
reverse_search(<image:10255>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss a global IT outage that occurred on July 19, 2024, due to a faulty software update from CrowdStrike. The outage affected various industries, including airlines and airports, causing flight cancellations and disruptions. The articles from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk)), and CNBC ([https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html)) do not contain the image <image:10255>.


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The search results indicate a global IT outage on July 19, 2024, affecting airlines and airports. However, the provided evidence does not confirm the image's context. The reverse image search did not yield any results.

The claim states that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack. The evidence does not support this claim.

To verify the claim, I need information about the image's origin and the events surrounding it.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results mention flight cancellations to Israel due to security concerns and Houthi threats to Ben Gurion Airport, as reported by [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-08-20/ty-article/.premium/delta-suspends-flights-to-israel-until-september-30-which-airlines-are-still-flying/00000191-70ba-d7fc-ab93-f2bf4c4f0000) and the [International Airport Review](https://www.internationalairportreview.com/news/273457/houthi-threats-to-ben-gurion-airport-spark-fresh-wave-of-airline-suspensions-to-israel-over-safety-fears/). The International Airport Review also mentions a global IT outage. Neither source contains the image <image:10255>

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that on July 19, 2024, Ben Gurion Airport experienced a global IT outage and faced threats from the Houthis. The image <image:10255>

## Final Judgement
The claim is that the image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack and a global IT outage on that day, the evidence does not confirm the image's context. The image could be related to the IT outage or the security concerns.

`false`
