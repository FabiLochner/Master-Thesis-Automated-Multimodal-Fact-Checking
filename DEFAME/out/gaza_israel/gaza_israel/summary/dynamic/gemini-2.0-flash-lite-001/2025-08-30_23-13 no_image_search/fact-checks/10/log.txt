Useful result: From [Source](https://www.marines.mil/News/Marines-TV/videoid/634642/dvpTag/Beirut/): 
Content: The search result from the U.S. Marine Corps website discusses the 40th anniversary of the Beirut barracks bombing, which occurred on October 23, 1983. The video shows Marines conducting a memorial run. <image:10205> is not present in the search result.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.dia.mil/News-Features/Articles/Article-View/Article/566917/they-came-in-peace/): 
Content: The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) responded to the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983. The article mentions the siege on Beirut in 1981. <image:1>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israeli-warplanes-bomb-beirut/): 
Content: The Brookings article, published on July 13, 2006, discusses Israeli warplanes bombing Beirut. The article includes a warning to Lebanese civilians about potential attacks. <image:10205> is not included in the article.

The claim '<image:10205> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is AI-generated, as confirmed by reverse image searches and AI detection tools, and does not depict a real event of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport. The image was originally posted on Instagram by the account "eyesoflebanon" and has been debunked by multiple fact-checking sources, including [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-photo-middle-east-airlines-flight-israel-airstrikes-beirut-lebanon-ai-generated-2622766-2024-10-24).
