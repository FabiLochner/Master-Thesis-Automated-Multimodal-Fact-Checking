## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024. However, multiple sources explicitly state that there were no casualties. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is false.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms a drone attack on Benjamin Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024, but multiple sources state there were no casualties. The claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the attack is therefore demonstrably false.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drone-strike-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-gaza-lebanon-hamas/), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon), these sources also state there were no casualties.
