### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania on September 23, 2024. The BBC News articles, published on September 26, 2024, discuss Zelenskyy's visit to the ammunition factory and his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden. The New York Post article, published on September 25, 2024, discusses Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and suggests it was a partisan political event. None of the sources mention Israeli bombs or the use of the ammunition against Palestinians in Gaza.
