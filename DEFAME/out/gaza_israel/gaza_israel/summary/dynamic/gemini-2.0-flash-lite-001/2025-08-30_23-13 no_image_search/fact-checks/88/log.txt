Useful result: From [Source](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/505094/Esmail-Qaani-target-of-a-Zionist-disinformation-campaign-amid): 
Content: The Tehran Times published an article on October 16, 2024, discussing a disinformation campaign targeting Esmail Qaani.

Useful result: From [Source](https://wanaen.com/from-rumor-to-reality-general-esmail-qaani-remains-on-the-scene/): 
Content: The WANA News article from October 15, 2024, debunks rumors about Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.minanews.net/iranian-commander-esmail-qaani-refutes-death-rumors-with-public-appearance/): 
Content: The Mi’raj News Agency (MINA) published an article on June 25, 2025, reporting that Esmail Qaani made a public appearance in Tehran to refute rumors of his death. The article mentions that Qaani attended a rally and that footage was released by Tasnim News Agency and Press TV. The article includes a picture of Qaani <image:12386>
The claim '<image:10252> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While Esmail Qaani is a real person, and there are reports of disinformation campaigns targeting him, there is no evidence to support the claim that the image depicts him in disguise. The search results indicate that the image is likely a misrepresentation and part of a disinformation campaign, as reported by sources like the [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/505094-Esmail-Qaani-target-of-a-Zionist-disinformation-campaign-amid).

So, the overall veracity is: false
