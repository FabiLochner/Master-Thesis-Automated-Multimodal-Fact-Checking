## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (![image 11663](media/2025-08-31_00-00-1756598456-651624.jpg)), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (![image 11669](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598466-391800.jpg)), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (![image 11669](media/2025-08-31_00-01-1756598466-391800.jpg)). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (![image 11665](media/2025-08-31_00-00-1756598458-237422.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's involvement in Syria and its relationship with Israel.  An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results reveal that in March 2025, Turkey directly intervened in Syria ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)), with the Armenian Weekly publishing an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the "second civil war" in Syria and the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel (![image 11663](media/2025-08-31_00-00-1756598456-651624.jpg)). PBS News reported on July 23, 2025, that Syria requested defense support from Turkey following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) (![image 11724](media/2025-08-31_00-02-1756598571-233930.jpg)). However, neither source mentions any direct communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025 and had strained relations with Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results highlight Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Turkey and Israel had strained relations and Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel. The search results show Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The fact-check did not find evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of strained relations between Turkey and Israel, and Turkey's involvement in Syria during that time, no sources ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)) or ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) mention any such communication.
