### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden’s hometown.

"We must all do our part in the fight for freedom – from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country," Shapiro captioned his video.

"We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression."

However, response from the right was brisk – with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. (AP Photo)

Other critics contrasted the autograph [with Shapiro’s](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-governor-democratic-attorney-general-josh-shapiro-defeats-gop-challenger-doug-mastriano)
 criticisms of former President Trump.

"Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition," wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

"He called Trump and Vance ‘radical’. – locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick – was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

 !Josh Shapiro speaks during the roll call of states on Day 2 of the Democratic National Convention <image:995>

Pennsylvania Gov. (Charles Creitz)

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the "birthplace of American freedom" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against "naked aggression."

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will "foster collaboration for years to come."

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger [told WHTM](https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/shapiro-zelenskyy-sign-agreement-establishing-partnership-between-pennsylvania-ukrainian-province/)
 that the pact will "help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians."

Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and Casey for further comment but did not receive a response at press time.

Volodymyr Zelensky (left) and Joe Biden said they would focus on Ukraine's "victory plan" at their White House talks

Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant alongside top Democrats on Friday

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

What was [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky](https://nypost.com/2024/09/25/us-news/house-gop-accuses-kamala-harris-of-using-zelensky-as-campaign-surrogate-launches-foreign-interference-inquiry/)
 doing at what sure _looked_ like a partisan US political event this week?

And how did the White House let this happen?

Zelensky got flown into battleground Pennsylvania aboard a USAF C-17 plane on Tuesday; he then toured the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant accompanied by Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Matt Cartwright — the last two being active Democratic candidates.

And it looks like no GOP candidates got invited — trapping a foreign head of state into apparently taking sides in US domestic politics.

Yet Zelensky was guarded by Secret Service agents and driven around in Secret Service vehicles, adding more reek of impropriety: Who covered those expenses?

Someone in the Biden administration pulled a fast one: Pennsylvania has a fair number of anti-Russian Polish-Americans and others of Eastern European heritage who might be swayed by Zelensky’s seeming preference.

Legalities aside, this is terrible for Zelensky: Ukraine desperately needs support from Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress, and will no matter who holds the White House next year.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Zelensky to fire his US ambassador for letting this disgrace happen, a move that could mend _Ukraine’s_ fences here.

But Congress will need answers on the American side, too: After all, Democrats impeached President Donald Trump over _his_ supposed abuses linked to Ukraine; now we have the misuse of a foreign guest’s visit to influence US politics.

We absolutely endorse US support of Kyiv against Moscow’s brutal invasion: Vladimir Putin must not succeed.

And Democratic candidates have every right to slam those Republicans who want to hang Ukraine out to dry.

But dragging any foreign leader, _especially_ one who’s seeking now new support for his nation from the White House, into US politics is morally criminal — at least.

Whether at the White House or the State Department, _American_ heads need to roll over this."

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing ammunition at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP) in Pennsylvania on September 23, 2024. The BBC News articles, published on September 26, 2024, discuss Zelenskyy's visit to the ammunition factory and his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden. The New York Post article, published on September 25, 2024, discusses Zelensky's visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant and suggests it was a partisan political event. None of the sources mention Israeli bombs or the use of the ammunition against Palestinians in Gaza.

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image shows Zelenskyy signing artillery shells at a U.S. munitions factory in September 2024, not Israeli bombs. The shells were intended for use in Ukraine's war with Russia, not against Palestinians in Gaza.

From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war): 
Content: "We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

“Syria is next to us, and any unrest there directly affects us,” Fidan said. Abdulkadir Selvi, a journalist close to the government, wrote in Hürriyet that US Special Representative for Syria Tom Barrack has adopted “a softer tone.” Barrack, who once insisted on “one nation, one people, one army, and one Syria,” has reportedly floated the idea of a “looser arrangement.”

“This stance by the US ambassador has caused concern in Ankara,” Selvi wrote, suggesting the shift may signal changes in Washington’s Syria policy.

**Regional Tensions Over Minority Demands**

Selvi also reported that Israel has pressed the US administration to secure privileges for Druze communities [under its influence in Syria](https://levant24.com/tag/hijri/)

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: "“With some international and local powers now adopting federal or decentralized models, Israel believes the time is right to apply military pressure to consolidate this model, particularly in the south, as a first step toward sharing influence and ensuring secure borders to strengthen influence in the northeast with the Syrian Defense Forces.”

Aware of the [fragility](https://snhr.org/blog/2025/03/11/803-individuals-extrajudicially-killed-between-march-6-10-2025/)
 that Sharaa’s government faces from the multiplicity of actors vying for control, however, Turkey has worked to strengthen the central government by using its own political card with Kurdish political factions to try to bring a close to any fragmentation of the Syrian state, even if it sees Erdogan drop a long held ideological mainstay.

Underlining Ankara’s seriousness, the first foreign visit to Syria after the fall of Assad came from Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in December. “I believe that it is still a little early to talk about the dissolution of the forces in Syria because we have one demand, which is the establishment of a decentralized authority for the Kurds in northern Syria,” the SDF military commander says. 

Nearly three months after the agreement was signed, Turkey’s [patience](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/290520251)
 was wearing thin.

In a meeting between Sharaa and Erdogan on May 24, the two sides discussed the formulation of a common vision to end “the ongoing threat” posed by the Kurdish forces to Syria’s territorial integrity and Turkey’s national security, through direct field and security coordination, says the source close to the Turkish president.

Speaking after a round of technical talks in Baku in April between the Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan tried to downplay what was on everyone’s mind.

August 28, 2025

With a shake of a hand in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in mid May, Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa completed his political transformation.

Gone was the man who once had an American [bounty](https://x.com/DigitalOutreach/status/862320076241993730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E862320076241993730%7Ctwgr%5E7104739bc23ce28a874a34d36e623f1bbb993594%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmonitor.com%2F20170511-dead-or-alive-us-offers-10-million-for-syria-rebel-commander%2F)
 of US$10 million on his head. A host of other investors are practically [salivating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/too-good-be-true-investors-eye-syria-after-trump-sanctions-move-2025-05-14/)
 to bring money back into the country.

Sharaa enjoyed a lavish Gulf tour, “living his best life,” as some commentators [noted](https://x.com/ragipsoylu/status/1929128687913390571?s=46&t=jkJlaUvTKeCtY4AcNtnlqQ)
.

In the high of the moment, and after repeated encounters with the Americans and mixed signals from the Israelis, Sharaa misread the messages and thought he was greenlit to take control of all of Suwayda, the city tucked away in the country’s south with a population predominantly made up of Druze, according to multiple sources.

And thus in just a few weeks’ time, Sharaa’s high of highs came crashing back to the earth.

On July 11, [clashes](https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7/769601/)
 broke out between Bedouin tribesmen and Druze figures on the Damascus-Suwayda road. Government troops have been shown to have been [implicated](https://x.com/suwayda24/status/1954520917066821658)
 in extrajudicial killings, often [filming](https://www.reuters.com/world/how-syrian-attackers-killed-one-hand-gun-another-camera-2025-07-29/)
 the attacks as threatening messages to those who don’t fall in line.

By July 16, Israel [began](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250716-israel-launches-heavy-airstrikes-in-damascus-vowing-to-protect-druze)
 bombing Syrian forces in Suwayda, declaring that they would protect the religious minority from the overreach of the new government. Satellite imagery [shows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/31/world/middleeast/israel-border-military-outposts-syria-lebanon-border.html)
 that they have also built watchtowers, prefabricated housing modules, roads and communication infrastructure throughout the buffer zone. <image:11687>](https://www.madamasr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/syria-map-edited-w_suwayda-spelling-correct.jpg)

Map of Israel’s projected influence in the south of Syria

In addition to bombing more than 500 sites across Syria, including the [capital](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2025/05/israel-used-12-aircraft-in-its-raids-on-syria/)
 of Damascus and the [port](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx808q7lrno)
 of Latakia, Israel also began to expand its ground invasion into the Daraa countryside, to create a new 15 kilometer security zone. As the pace of the Israeli attacks continued unabated after the ouster of Assad, several diplomatic pathways emerged, the most public of which have been the [talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-israel-have-begun-talks-avoid-clashes-syria-turkish-sources-say-2025-04-10/)
 between Turkey and Israel in the Azerbaijani capital Baku aimed at creating a “technical mechanism” to reduce “unwanted incidents” in Syria.

According to a former Syrian diplomat, the Israeli attacks in the south of Syria are in part driven by a concern about Turkey’s potential influence near Israeli-held territory.

“After Iran’s withdrawal from Syria, Turkey is looking to fill the vacuum by striking understandings with the new leadership in Damascus,” the diplomat says. This would ⁠prevent any Turkish military or factional presence near the Golan Heights and bide time until Israel can⁠ find a reliable local partner in the future as an unofficial line of defense, the diplomat says.

This concern was echoed in Israel. 

Writing for an Israeli think tank focused on “Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Syria,” authors Tal Beeri and Boaz Shapira spell out the concern in blunt terms in a March article: “A scenario in which Turkish Air Force jets operate in Syrian airspace against Israeli Air Force jets is a possible one.” And in equal measure, they proffered a threat: “Israel must set the rules of the game in the region."

Since taking office more than 22 years ago, Erdogan has not only heaped verbal abuse on Israel but supported terrorist groups, like Hamas, actively working for its destruction. Turkey has long hosted Hamas leaders, with whom Erdogan has repeatedly met, and Hamas has used Turkish soil to plot terrorist attacks against Israel."

Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check reveals that Turkey, under President Erdogan, was critical of Israel's involvement in Syria and made strong statements against Israel's actions. However, the evidence does not confirm that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of Erdogan's stance against Israel and meetings with Syrian officials, there is no direct evidence of a request to the U.S.

Syria asks Turkey for defense support after weeks of sectarian violence
=======================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Jul 23, 2025 1:38 PM EDT

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Syria’s interim government has requested Turkey’s support to strengthen its defense capabilities, Turkish officials said Wednesday, following sectarian violence over the past two weeks that increased tensions in Syria and drew Israeli intervention.

Syria has also sought assistance to combat “terrorist organizations,” including the Islamic State group, said the defense officials, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.

Turkey, which has long expressed readiness to assist Syria, was working toward providing training, advisory services and technical support to help strengthen Syria’s defense capacity, the officials added.

Syrian officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

“As long as our brotherly country, Syria, requests it, Turkey will continue to stand firmly by its side,” Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, told reporters when asked to comment on the Syrian request.

“The heroic Turkish armed forces will fulfill this both to assist our Syrian brothers and to prevent instability there, which is vital for Turkey’s national security,” he said.

Tensions escalated in southern Syria last week when violent clashes erupted between Bedouin Arab tribes and minority Druze militias in Sweida province. Implementation of the deal has stalled, with a major sticking point being whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.

On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned Kurdish and other groups in Syria against exploiting the tensions to pursue autonomy, stating that any attempt to divide Syria would be viewed as a direct threat to Turkey’s national security and could prompt intervention.

Turkey considers the SDF as a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey.

The Turkish officials said Turkey expects the SDF to follow through on its commitments under the agreement, adding that Turkey would be “following” the situation.

The situation in Syria has increased tensions between Turkey and Israel. Israel accused Turkey of trying to build a “protectorate” in Syria.

 [Suzan Fraser, Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/suzan-fraser-associated-press) The conflict triggered Israeli airstrikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and on the Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus, which Israel justified to protect Druze communities.

The U.S. After a second ceasefire, the government forces withdrew from Sweida, but fighting flared again between Druze and Bedouin groups.

Ankara strongly supports Syria’s interim government led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa and has been seeking a defense agreement with Damascus that could reportedly include establishing Turkish military bases on Syrian territory.

### Turkey backs the integration of Kurds in the Syrian army

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this week, Barrack said the U.S. In April, Israel struck five cities in Syria, including more than a dozen strikes near a strategic air base in the city of Hama, where Turkey reportedly has interests in having a military presence. envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, announced a U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria on July 19, which allowed the Syrian government forces to go into Sweida and break up the fighting between the Druze and Bedouins. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.

“It’s not in the U.S. business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.

Ankara also backs an agreement reached between the interim Syrian administration and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, to integrate into Syria’s national army."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025."

## Actions
```
web_search("Turkey President US Israel Syria February March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.


## Actions
```
web_search("Erdogan US Israel Syria March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's involvement in Syria and its relationship with Israel.  An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

[Close](#) Turkish policy appears driven by three primary goals: to inhibit, through direct intervention, any consolidation of a Kurdish self-governing enclave along the southern border; to orchestrate the organized, albeit selective, return of Syrian refugees under a Turkish oversight apparatus; and, ultimately, to lay the foundations of a post-Assad settlement conforming to Ankara’s strategic calculus and its pan-Islamist conception of regional order.

Within these zones, Ankara has inserted substitutive governance networks, dispersing gendarmeries, judge panels and municipal advisory bodies that are underpinned by Turkish parliamentary appropriations. Accordingly, the reconfiguration of Syria’s political order will hinge as much upon these domestic actors as upon any external endeavor to impose change.

**Legacy actors recalibrate** 

Even as Turkey and Israel now dominate the foreign policy landscape in Syria, the influence of Russia and Iran—once the key players of the Assad regime—has not entirely disappeared from the equation. Turkey and Israel, for instance, impose authority over selected territories without openly claiming them; the resulting spheres of governance more closely resemble imperial protectorates than classical foreign military occupations, thereby reconstituting the region’s constitutional and geopolitical boundaries without invoking outright annexation.

**Conclusion: Controlled disintegration as doctrine**

If the Syrian model is reproduced, the region may enter an era in which weaker states function as laboratories for informal empire and diplomacy is replaced by strategic classification. As this would also be in Israel’s interests, Israel would help in any way practical, not merely militarily.

Your email address will not be published. In this chaotic vacuum, Turkey and Israel have re-engaged, translating Syria’s power void into a contest of occupied sovereign space, masked by counterterrorism and humanitarian rhetoric.

**Competing foreign agendas**

In the shifting strategic landscape of post-Assad Syria, both countries have consolidated their positions in what many now refer to as Syria’s “second civil war”—a reconfiguration of violence in which domestic forces have become subordinate to competitive regional designs. Despite diverging styles and strategic end goals, Turkey and Israel have emerged as the leading external powers, influencing both territorial reconfigurations and institutional developments in Syria’s new order.

Ankara’s engagement is both pervasive and systematic. Concurrently, the circulation of the Turkish lira and the promulgation of Turkish-language curricula illustrate an integration that transcends influence, resembling statecraft more than temporary occupation.

By contrast, Israel pursues a policy of indirect intervention aimed principally at threat containment, rather than seizing territory."

### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) reported on August 29, 2025, that Turkey severed ties with Israel and closed its airspace due to the Gaza war, accusing Israel of undermining Syria's recovery efforts. Levant24.com ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)) discusses Turkey's concerns regarding Syria, including the SDF's delay in implementing a March deal, and mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria.

The article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) discusses the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria, including meetings between Turkish and Israeli leaders in September 2023 (<image:11663>), a meeting between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister on January 15, 2025 (<image:11669>), and a meeting on March 14, 2025, where Israeli Druze leader Sheik Mowafaq Tarif hosted Druze leaders from Syria (<image:11669>). It also mentions a handshake between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 (<image:11665>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Turkey was concerned about Israel's involvement in Syria. Specifically, the evidence mentions Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's criticism of Israel's involvement in Syria ([Source](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/)). Additionally, the evidence indicates that Turkey had meetings with Syrian officials in January and February 2025 ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)).

However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the provided information.

To verify the claim, information about direct communication between the Turkish President and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria during March 2025 is needed.

An article from Madamasr.com ([Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/)) mentions a meeting between Turkish President Erdogan and the Syrian Interim President on February 4, 2025, and talks between Turkey and Israel in Baku in April 2025. A JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated," and that Foreign Minister Fidan said Turkey would not "sit and watch" Israel's actions in Syria.


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides more context but still doesn't fully verify the claim. The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

The JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) states that Erdogan made strong statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but it doesn't mention any direct communication with the U.S. urging them to control Israel.

The evidence confirms Erdogan's strong stance against Israel's actions in Syria, but the claim requires evidence of a direct request to the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results reveal that in March 2025, Turkey directly intervened in Syria ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)), with the Armenian Weekly publishing an article on August 5, 2025, discussing the "second civil war" in Syria and the strategic contest for influence between Turkey and Israel (<image:11663>). PBS News reported on July 23, 2025, that Syria requested defense support from Turkey following sectarian violence and Israeli intervention ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) (<image:11724>). However, neither source mentions any direct communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding Israel's actions in Syria in March 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025 and had strained relations with Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The search results highlight Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Turkey and Israel had strained relations and Turkey was involved in Syria in March 2025, there is no evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel. The search results show Turkey's direct intervention and Syria's request for defense support, but they do not mention any such communication.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The fact-check did not find evidence to support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. While there is evidence of strained relations between Turkey and Israel, and Turkey's involvement in Syria during that time, no sources ([Source](https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/05/syrias-second-civil-war-turkey-and-israels-strategic-contest-for-influence/)) or ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/syria-asks-turkey-for-defense-support-after-weeks-of-sectarian-violence)) mention any such communication.

October 2, 2024

Millions of Israelis scrambled for cover amid air raid sirens as Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles into the Zionist state on October 1, the latest escalation in a growing conflict that is threatening to drag the entire region into a [broader war](https://trt.global/world/article/18214961)
.

The attack proved yet again that Israel’s much-vaunted air defence system—[said](https://nation.time.com/2012/11/19/iron-dome-a-missile-shield-that-works/)
 to be the “most effective, most-tested missile shield the world has ever seen”—is far from impenetrable.

As the missile defence system came under the spotlight, security experts rushed to analyse its weak spots and how it was overwhelmed by the missile barrage.

“Iran’s strategy of launching missile barrages is designed to saturate air defence systems and force the Israelis to make tough choices about which to engage and which to let pass under significant time constraints,” Samuel Hickey of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation tells _TRT World_.

Israel [said](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/01/politics/iran-missile-attack-israel/index.html)
 it intercepted a “majority” of the ballistic missiles, which means the interception rate was less than 100 percent. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for the Israeli forces, [said](https://x.com/JoeTruzman/status/1841203657712550215)
 Iranian missiles hit central and southern Israel.

However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) [insisted](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/iran-claims-90-of-its-missiles-hit-their-targets-in-israel/)
 that 90 percent of its missiles hit the intended targets.

It was the [largest ballistic missile strike](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-02/iran-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-air-defence/104420966)
 on any country in history.

“We still don’t know if the missiles that appeared to breach Israel’s air defence systems had their payloads intact or reached their intended targets,” Hickey says, noting that Iran seemingly launched some of its more advanced missiles in the October 1 attack.

Tehran intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by [oversaturating](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)
 Israeli air defence, particularly in central Israel.

That’s because the number of ballistic missiles fired was about 180, notably higher than the approximately 120 similar projectiles it hurled at Israel in an earlier attack on [April 15](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-hezbollah-conflict/card/how-big-is-iran-s-missile-arsenal--earTfWyIeIJgWnm5UHor)
.

**How Israeli air defence system works**

Israel has a three-tier air defence system. Iran's missile programme has consistently been a significant focus of Israeli intelligence, and Israeli officials have likely accounted for the limitations of their defence systems in such scenarios,” he says.

It is the third time Israel’s air defence systems have become overwhelmed by a massive number of missiles entering its airspace at once.

First, an intense rocket barrage from [Hamas in the surprise attack](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-08/israeli-intelligence-caught-by-surprise-hamas-attack/102949034)
 on October 8 last year [saturated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-10/what-is-israel-iron-dome-air-defence-gaza-rockets/102952172)
 Israel’s air defence system. Then Iran launched a missile attack against Israel on April 15, leaving Israeli air defence systems [overwhelmed](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-16/how-israel-air-defence-stopped-iran-drone-missile-attacks/103707770)
.

“Even with a strong intercept record, the offence-defence race dramatically favours the offence,” he says.

According to a [report](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-1-2024)
 by the Institute for the Study of War, a higher number of missiles fired by Iran in the latest attack targeted a “very small geographic area in densely populated” parts of central Israel.

It means all missiles hurtling towards the densely populated area presumably needed interception.

“The increase \[in the number of\] in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defence system by saturating it,” it said.

Hickey says each attack, especially one that partially breaches defences, provides data for improving interception algorithms, tactics and technology.

“Israel is likely to analyse any weaknesses or failures in its missile defence response and adapt accordingly… States must only overwhelm defences by saturating key target areas with incoming missiles.”

!How Iran breached Israel’s air defence by overwhelming it with missiles <image:11762>

[WORLD](/world/world)

6 MIN READ

How Iran breached Israel’s air defence by overwhelming it with missilesIran’s strategy of sending hundreds of missiles into Israel at once is ‘designed to saturate’ its air defence systems.

Share

Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets after Iran fired a salvo of ballistic missiles, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel. The first or bottom tier is the most talked about Iron Dome, which intercepts short-range, surface-to-surface rockets of up to 70-kilometre range.

David’s Sling is the middle tier that intercepts medium-range missiles of up to 300 kilometres.

The third tier consists of Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 defence systems meant to intercept medium- and long-range missiles of up to 2,000 kilometres.

A number of mobile “batteries” of air defence systems deployed around big cities help Israel detect any projectile before it enters its air space.

Based on the trajectory of an incoming rocket, the system quickly estimates the precise impact location. If the anticipated site of the impact is far from populated areas or military installations, the system lets the rocket land without interception.

Otherwise, the air defence system quickly fires an “interceptor missile” aimed at pulverising the moving rocket before it can land inside Israel.

Tel Aviv likely anticipated the possibility of some missiles breaching its defence systems, Hickey says.

“Israeli defence planners are aware that no system can guarantee 100 percent interception."

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.

 [Associated Press](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/associated-press) The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas.

It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

While PBS News states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)), the Wikipedia article indicates that Israel reported shooting down "most" of the missiles, and the Israeli military disputed Iran's claim of 90% of its missiles hitting their targets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)).

TRT World reported that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)). The evidence does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the [one in April](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.  

"It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around," says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif. Our air force and air force bases remain operational."

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. The strike appears to have been more sophisticated than one earlier this year.**

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

## Claim
Claim: "The Iron Dome intercepted 90% of ballistic missiles fired at Israel in Iran's attack on October 1, 2024."

## Actions

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article on the October 1, 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel, codenamed Operation True Promise II, states that Iran launched approximately 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. Israel reported shooting down most of the missiles, while Iran claimed 90% of its missiles hit their targets. The Israeli military disputed Iran's claim, stating that "a large number" of missiles were intercepted. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)) <image:i>

TRT World reported on the Iran attack on October 1, 2024, stating that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles. ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)) <image:11762> PBS News reported that Iran fired over 180 missiles and that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90%.

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the Iron Dome's interception rate during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack. While PBS News states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)), the Wikipedia article indicates that Israel reported shooting down "most" of the missiles, and the Israeli military disputed Iran's claim of 90% of its missiles hitting their targets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)).

TRT World reported that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)). The evidence does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome during the attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

Elizabeth Dent is the Nathan and Esther K. The Iraqi militia [Kataib Hezbollah](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/profile-kataib-hezbollah)
 added that any strike on Iranian oil targets will spur attacks on Gulf oil targets. Moreover, Gulf littoral cities are much closer to Iran than Israeli cities, so leaders fear they could be effectively targeted by larger swarms of short-range missiles and drones in addition to MRBMs.

Since last week’s attack—most notably on October 9, when Saudi crown prince Muhammad bin Salman [met with](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-crown-prince-meets-iran-foreign-minister-riyadh-saudi-agency-says-2024-10-09/)
 Iran’s foreign minister in Riyadh—Gulf officials have signaled that they view their previous [Chinese-brokered detente](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/closing-washingtons-china-gap-middle-east-partners)
 with Tehran as the best defense against Iran’s arsenal. Yet some of Iran’s munitions were able to penetrate, and America’s vulnerable regional partners may not view the widespread imagery of Iranian missile impacts in the same terms as Washington. 

**A New Test for Missile Defense Cooperation**
----------------------------------------------

According to a [Pentagon release](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3923123/us-assets-in-mediterranean-again-helped-defend-israel-against-iranian-missiles/)
 immediately after the October 1 attack, the strike was “nearly twice the scope” of Iran’s [April 13 attack](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/series/risks-and-opportunities-post-april-13-middle-east)
 on Israel—an assessment that seemingly referred to the number of MRBMs used and the number of sites hit. foreign and defense policy toward the Gulf states, Iraq, and Syria.

Brief Analysis

In discussing missile defense cooperation with risk-averse Gulf partners, Washington needs to realistically address the specifics of Iran’s latest attack on Israel, including the degree to which defenses were penetrated.

On October 1, Iran fired a wave of around 200 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) at Israel, targeting air bases, radar facilities, and security elements that Tehran deems responsible for the recent killings of Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. The release concluded that “while most of the missiles were destroyed before reaching their target, some did impact and cause minimal damage.”

The April 13 attack used more overall munitions than October 1 (320, including drones), but all 200 missiles used on October 1 were MRBMs compared to around 120 MRBMs in April. Iran also appeared to target four or five sites this time, versus a reported three in April.

Furthermore, the latest attack included only Iranian launches, while April 13 included a smattering of drone, Katyusha, and cruise missile launches by Iranian partners in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. U.S., British, and French assets intercepted a significant proportion of the April 13 munitions, [aided](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hezbollah-naim-qassem-exclusive-interview-war-escalation-rcna148332)
 by Jordan and likely other Arab partners. Vivid imagery of Iranian missiles hitting Israeli territory may have more psychological impact there than Washington realizes, and “minimal damage” may be unacceptable. 

In general, Gulf leaders believe that layered air defenses and IAMD are critical to intercepting potential future attacks—a view shaped by the drone and cruise missile strikes that hit Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq and Khurais refineries in September 2019, and by the drones and missiles that the Yemeni Houthis and Iran-backed Iraqi militias launched against Abu Dhabi in January-February 2022. Yet the imagery of missiles penetrating these defenses on October 1 could give them doubts about intercepting a high proportion of Iranian projectiles during a potential future conflict in the Gulf, even with ample investment and partnerships via the United States and Israel. 

Statements by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) play into this fear, threatening that any U.S. officials should not try to sugarcoat the reality that several Iranian missiles did penetrate Israel’s defenses on October 1. Absent an Israeli government statement on the attack’s precise impact, open-source estimates indicate that 181 of the fired missiles launched successfully, and around three-quarters of these were intercepted en route—primarily by Israeli air defenses, with help from the U.S."

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)

## Elaboration
The evidence presents conflicting information regarding the Iron Dome's interception rate during the October 1, 2024, Iranian attack. While PBS News states that the Iron Dome has a success rate of over 90% ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)), the Wikipedia article indicates that Israel reported shooting down "most" of the missiles, and the Israeli military disputed Iran's claim of 90% of its missiles hitting their targets ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)).

TRT World reported that Israel intercepted a "majority" of the ballistic missiles ([https://trt.global/world/article/18215314](https://trt.global/world/article/18215314)). The evidence does not provide a specific interception rate for the Iron Dome during the attack.

The Washington Institute estimates around three-quarters of the missiles were intercepted, and Al Jazeera reports that the Israeli military said it intercepted "a large number" of the missiles, while the IRGC claimed 90 percent of the projectiles hit their targets.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

Some of the children are making thumbs-up gestures. <image:11999>al-Dalou family photograph

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y5d33dmepo)
    
*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:11998>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:12008>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

GEOFF BENNETT: Welcome to the "News Hour."

A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens.

Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.

AMNA NAWAZ: That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.

That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.

And a warning: Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V.

that was supposed to heal became shackles.

Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.

AOUNI KHATTAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out.

A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him.

He turned to ashes.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: At least four people were killed and dozens injured.

Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments.

Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.

UHM MAHMOUD WADHI, Displaced Gazan (through translator): Everything has burned, everything.

As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters.

Where shall I go?

My tent has collapsed, destroyed.

All our clothes and belongings are gone.

Who should we speak to?

Where is the safety?

We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us.

We are exhausted.

We have had enough.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter.

The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.

FATIMA AL AJAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): (through translator): They were sleeping unarmed.

They're innocent.

This is little Rahad's blanket here.

She was only 2 years old.

This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere.

Then there was another wave of airstrikes.

The injured and dead were everywhere.

We have had enough of this.

Have mercy on us.

They took their childhoods away.

They took our smiles away.

They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war.

He doesn't fear death anymore.

He's seen too much.

ABDULLAH AL AJAB, Displaced Gazan (through translator): The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital.

The children here are dying.

Everyone is going to die.

We're not going to keep going from place to place.

At least we will die in our country.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone.

The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.

Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.

REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through translator): We are required to provide better protection.

We will investigate this incident, learn and improve.

Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.

After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli Prime Minister (through translator): It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas.

The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists.

Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.

The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages.

Fully a third of the country is now under fire.

Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.

The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country.

In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.

Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other.

The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south.

His family survived, but many in their building didn't.

MOHAMMAD SALAMOUN, Beirut Resident (through translator): We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything.

I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this.

When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: Some have decided they can't take it anymore.

Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.

After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.

WIDAD LAKHAL, Displaced From Lebanon (through translator): My heart is in Lebanon.

We will definitely return to Lebanon.

I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear.

One can't trust Israel.

It targets all the places.

LEILA MOLANA-ALLEN: As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling.

It is burning.

For the "PBS News Hour," I'm Leila Molana-Allen in Beirut.

Israel’s military struck what it said was a Hamas command center [embedded inside a hospital compound in the Deir al-Balah](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/10/14/israel-airstrike-gaza-hospital-tent-camp-fire/)
 region of central Gaza early Monday. At least four people were killed in the attack within the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital grounds and 40 injured, including women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said. A widely shared video of the fierce blaze appeared to show at least one person on a bed burning alive while onlookers shouted. Separately, Israel’s military said it struck 200 targets linked to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:12085>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

**Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1**.\[72\] This is the second time that Hezbollah targeted Mossad Headquarters near Tel Aviv in the recent days.\[73\] Hezbollah also reported that it fired a Fadi-4 rocket targeting Unit 8200 headquarters near Tel Aviv for the first time on October 1.\[74\] Unit 8200 is an Israeli Intelligence Corps unit responsible for signals intelligence and similar activities.\[75\] Hezbollah separately claimed that it fired medium-range rockets targeting Sde Dov Airport, which closed in 2019, near Tel Aviv on October 1.\[76\] Hezbollah said that these attacks are part of “Operation Khaybar,” which is Hezbollah’s response to the Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah on September 27.\[77\] The IDF has not commented on either attack at this time.

**Hezbollah continued its attack campaign targeting Israeli civilian and military sites in Israel on October 1.**  Hezbollah conducted a two-wave rocket attack targeting an IDF position in Metula.\[78\] The IDF said that it detected several projectiles over Metula and intercepted some of them.\[79\] Hezbollah also mortared Israeli forces in Avivim on October 1.\[80\] The IDF said that it also identified individual projectiles that fell in open areas in Avivim.\[81\] Hezbollah claimed on October 1 that the latest attack campaign against Israel is in response to Israel’s ”invasion” of Lebanese towns and villages.\[82\]

!

**Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.\[83\]** The US ambassador to Iraq announced that an attack took place at the Diplomatic Support Complex, which is a US State Department facility.\[84\] The attack occurred hours before the Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting Israel. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah may not engage Israeli forces while Israeli forces are only staging “sporadic raids” that do not remain in Lebanon.
*   **Hezbollah Attacks Targeting Northern Israel:** Hezbollah fired “Fadi-4” medium-range rockets targeting the Mossad headquarters near Tel Aviv on October 1.
*   **Iraq:** Likely Iranian-backed Iraqi militias conducted a rocket attack targeting a US diplomatic facility near Baghdad International Airport on October 1.
*   **Houthis:** Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.
*   **Terrorist Attack in Israel:** Two unidentified individuals shot and killed eight civilians in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, on October 1.

!

**Gaza Strip**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Erode the will of the Israeli political establishment and public to sustain clearing operations in the Gaza Strip
*   Reestablish Hamas as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip

**The IDF Air Force struck a Hamas command-and-control site in the northern Gaza Strip on October 1.\[97\]** The IDF reported that Hamas had been using a former United Nations Relief and Works Agency school east of Gaza City as a site to plan and execute attacks targeting Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip and into Israeli territory.\[98\] The IDF added that it took steps to minimize casualties in the airstrike.\[99\]

**Palestinian militias conducted three attacks targeting Israeli forces and armor near the Netzarim Corridor on October 1.\[100\]**

!

!

**West Bank**

**Axis of Resistance objectives:**

*   Establish the West Bank as a viable front against Israel

**The IDF reported on October 1 that Israeli security forces conducted an operation in the Balata refugee camp, Nablus, and killed two Palestinian fighters.\[101\]** The IDF identified one of the two fighters killed in Balata refugee camp as a member of the al Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.\[102\] The IDF said that this individual was responsible for conducting shooting attacks targeting IDF positions in the West Bank and recruiting fighters from Nablus.\[103\] The IDF also recovered several firearms and IEDs and detained two wanted persons during the operation. UKMTO reported sustained damage to _Minoan Courage_.\[116\]

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. <image:12093>

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. Israeli Army Radio reported that over 3,000 of Hezbollah’s Radwan special operations forces deployed along the Israel-Lebanon border following the October 7 attacks to conduct a long-planned ground infiltration into northern Israel.\[56\] Hezbollah pioneered the idea of ground attacks into Israel, and it developed the Radwan Force to this end.\[57\]

!

**The IDF Air Force continued its air campaign to degrade Hezbollah's leadership and capabilities on October 1.** The IDF continued to target Hezbollah weapons launchers, weapons storage facilities, and other military infrastructure across Lebanon.\[58\] The IDF’s air campaign concentrated airstrikes primarily on southern Lebanon but also continued to target sites in the Bekaa Valley."

At least four people have been killed and dozens of others wounded in an Israeli air attack on a hospital complex in central Gaza where displaced Palestinians sought shelter from Israel’s assault on the besieged territory.

The attack in the early hours of Monday struck the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital complex in Deir el-Balah and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp.

The Israeli military confirmed that hospitals were also included in its evacuation orders, adding that it had not set a timetable and was working with local authorities to facilitate patient transfers.

Fares Abu Hamza, an official with Gaza Health Ministry’s emergency service, told The Associated Press news agency that bodies of a “large number of martyrs” remain uncollected from the streets and under rubble in the north.

“We are unable to reach them,” he said, adding that dogs were eating some remains.

Israel launched its offensive on Gaza after Hamas led an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 others as hostages, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.

Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 42,200 people, mostly women and children, and injured about 98,400, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Gaza’s Media Office said it was the seventh time this year that Israel has hit the grounds of Al-Aqsa Hospital and the third in the past couple of weeks, killing Palestinians who were forced to flee their homes.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said more than 20 tents were destroyed in the attack.

“There were many people inside the tents as the fire spread, who could not be saved,” he said. In recent months, it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent sites, alleging armed groups were using them.

“What happened was that we woke up to smoke, flames, fire and burning pieces falling on the tents from every direction. The explosions terrified us in our tents and outside where we live behind Al-Aqsa Hospital,” Om Ahmad Radi, a survivor at the scene, told Al Jazeera.

“The fire trucks couldn’t get here. The amount of fire and explosions was enormous."

Witnesses to Israeli strike on Gaza hospital compound saw 'so many people burning'

Watch: People battle to put out fires after Israeli strike hits Gaza hospital tent camp

**Warning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting**

Witnesses to an Israeli air strike and resulting fire at a tent camp in a Gaza hospital compound have shared with the BBC their horror and helplessness at seeing people injured and killed in the flames.

One mother called it “one of the worst scenes we’ve witnessed”, while an injured girl said she heard screaming as people tore down their tent to get them out. The military said the incident was under review.

Charity Doctors without Borders (MSF), which has staff working at al-Aqsa, told the BBC “it had no knowledge“ of a Hamas centre and said “the hospital functions as a hospital”.

The UN's humanitarian affairs agency said in a statement that “people burned to death” and “atrocities must end”, while a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council called the footage “disturbing”.

"The images and video of what appear to be displaced civilians burning alive following an Israeli air strike are deeply disturbing and we have made our concerns clear to the Israeli government,” the spokesperson told the BBC’s partner CBS.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties — and what happened here is horrifying, even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

BBC Verify analyses footage from Gaza strikes

Witnesses said the strike happened at about 01:15 local time on Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

It hit an area between buildings filled with makeshift shelters, next to an outdoor outpatient waiting area that had no one there at night, Anna Halford, MSF's emergency coordinator in Gaza who was not at the hospital during the strike, said in a phone call from Deir al-Balah.

Hiba Radi, a mother who was living in a tent behind the hospital, told a BBC freelancer in Gaza she woke up to the sound of “explosions and fires erupting around the tents”.

“There were explosions everywhere, and we were shocked at whether this was gas or weapons,” she said.

“This is one of the worst scenes we've witnessed and lived through," she added. A man said he had "broken down" as he was "unable to do anything" to help those who burned to death.

The strike hit the al-Aqsa Hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, in the early hours of Monday, igniting a fire that burned makeshift shelters for displaced people.

At least four people were killed and dozens injured, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The BBC has verified the location of a video that shows what appears to be a person on fire. Other footage captures people rushing to extinguish the flames amid screams and explosions sending fireballs into the night sky.

The Israeli military said it had targeted Hamas fighters operating inside a command centre in the car park, after which a fire broke out "likely due to secondary explosions". The people next to us tore down the tent to get us out,” she said.

Her grandmother said the family “lost their tent and everything they had; they have nothing left”.

The health ministry reported on Monday that more than 40 people were injured and four killed.

MSF on Tuesday shared a higher toll, saying five people had died, their bodies burned by the time they were recovered, and 65 injured.

Forty of the injured - 22 men, eight women and 10 children - stayed at al-Aqsa. It stays with you,” she said.

Monday’s strike was the seventh on the hospital site since March, and the third in two weeks, Ms Halford said.

When she arrived at the hospital after the most recent hit, she said she found people picking through twisted metal and burned debris to salvage any belongings.

Another mother the BBC spoke to whose children suffered burns injuries had already evacuated from north Gaza - and now has nothing.

The acting chief of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the strike occurred in an area where north Gaza residents had been told to relocate.

“There really is no safe place in Gaza for people to go,” the statement read.

Atia Darwish, a photographer who recorded some of the verified videos, told the BBC it was a “big shock” and he was “unable to do anything” watching people burn.

“I was so broken down,” he said.

Um Yaser Abdel Hamid Daher, who also lives at the hospital, told the BBC “we've seen so many people burning that we started feeling like we might burn like them”.

The injured included her son, and his wife and children. The others were transferred to different hospitals, with eight going to a specialist burns unit.

Ms Halford said her colleagues were treating burns victims ”who will almost certainly not survive", saying “there is very little you can do for burn victims of that severity”.

“You come home with the smell of it on your clothes. "We’ve never seen destruction like this before. Her granddaughter Lina, 11, who had shrapnel in her hand and leg injuries, said she had heard people screaming.

”Our neighbour’s daughter was injured in her head and her dad was killed."

The geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Israel. Therefore, the claim that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Iranian strikes against Israel occurred on October 1, 2024, and that there was an Israeli attack on tents sheltering displaced people in Gaza. However, the geolocation analysis suggests that the image was not taken in Israel. Therefore, the claim that the image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there were Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, and an Israeli attack on tents in Gaza, the image in question was not taken in Israel, according to geolocation analysis.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

TPO - Các chính trị gia Israel tuyên bố Iran sẽ phải “trả giá” vì vụ tấn công bằng máy bay không người lái vào nhà của Thủ tướng Benjamin Netanyahu mà họ gọi là nỗ lực ám sát.

| Khu nhà riêng của Thủ tướng [Israel](https://tienphong.vn/tag/israel.tpo "Israel")<br> Benjamin Netanyahu ở thị trấn Caesarea. (Ảnh: Times of Israel) |

Ba chiếc [máy bay không người lái](https://tienphong.vn/tag/m%c3%a1y+bay+kh%c3%b4ng+ng%c6%b0%e1%bb%9di+l%c3%a1i.tpo "máy bay không người lái")
 được phóng từ Li-băng vào khu [nhà riêng](https://tienphong.vn/post-1683835.tpo)
 của Thủ tướng Israel trong sáng 19/10. Hai chiếc bị đánh chặn, nhưng chiếc thứ 3 phát nổ ở Caesarea, thị trấn nghỉ dưỡng nơi tập trung những căn biệt thự hạng sang và các công trình kiến trúc thời La Mã.

Thủ tướng Netanyahu và phu nhân không ở nhà vào thời điểm xảy ra vụ tấn công.

Trang _Axios_ đưa tin chiếc máy bay không người lái đã lao vào nhà của ông Netanyahu. “Đây là lần đầu tiên kể từ khi bắt đầu cuộc chiến, một mục tiêu liên quan trực tiếp đến ông Netanyahu bị khoá mục tiêu”, _Axios_ viết.

Báo _Guardian_ cũng đưa tin chiếc máy bay không người lái đã rơi trúng ngôi nhà, gây hư hỏng ở phần ngoài.

Sau khi xác nhận nhà của mình bị máy bay không người lái tấn công, Thủ tướng Netanyahu tuyên bố “các điệp viên Iran cố ám sát tôi và vợ tôi hôm nay đã phạm một sai lầm nghiêm trọng”

Nhiều bộ trưởng và nghị sĩ đối lập cũng đưa ra phát biểu tương tự, cảnh báo Iran sẽ phải hối tiếc về hành động của lực lượng đồng minh Hezbollah.

Vụ tấn công về cơ bản là đã nhắm vào “nhà nước Israel và các biểu tượng của chính phủ”, Bộ trưởng Quốc phòng Israel Yoav Gallant tuyên bố.

Trong khi đó, Iran tách mình khỏi vụ tấn công và nói rằng đây là hành động của Hezbollah, còn Hezbollah vẫn chưa nhận trách nhiệm.

Phái đoàn thường trực Iran tại Liên Hợp Quốc tuyên bố “đã đáp trả Israel”, ngụ ý nói đến vụ phóng hàng trăm tên lửa đạn đạo ngày 1/10. Phái đoàn khẳng định rằng “hành động đang bị nghi ngờ là do lực lượng Hezbollah ở Li-băng” thực hiện.

Ngoại trưởng Israel Israel Katz nhấn mạnh vụ tấn công bằng máy bay không người lái cho thấy “bộ mặt thật” của Iran và “trục ma quỷ” mà nước này lãnh đạo. Ông cũng bác bỏ phát biểu của phái đoàn Iran.

“Lực lượng đại diện hàng đầu mà Iran tạo ra, tài trợ, vũ trang, huấn luyện và kiểm soát bỗng nhiên bị mô tả như một tổ chức độc lập. Những lời nói dối và giả vờ đó sẽ không giúp gì đâu – các ông sẽ phải chịu trách nhiệm”, ông Katz viết trong bài đăng trên mạng xã hội X.

_Kênh 12_ của Israel đưa tin, Israel muốn dùng vụ tấn công nhằm vào ông Netanyahu như một lý do để “tăng tính chính đáng cho việc mở rộng mục tiêu tấn công”, khi Israel tiến hành chiến dịch đáp trả Tehran vì vụ phóng tên lửa ngày 1/10.

Ông Netanyahu đã trao đổi với ứng viên tổng thống đảng Cộng hoà Mỹ Donald Trump sau vụ tấn công, Văn phòng thủ tướng Israel nói với báo _Times of Israel_. Ông cũng đã có cuộc trao đổi qua điện thoại với Chủ tịch Hạ viện Mỹ Mike Johnson.

“Tôi nói với ông ấy rằng Mỹ ủng hộ mạnh mẽ Israel và nhắc lại cam kết của chúng tôi sẽ giúp họ đối phó với Iran và các lực lượng đại diện”, ông Johnson viết trong bài đăng trên mạng X.

Báo chí Israel dẫn nguồn tin cho biết, Ngoại trưởng Mỹ Antony Blinken sẽ đến Israel vào đầu tuần tới, nhân chuyến công tác đến Trung Đông.

Các quan chức này, nói với điều kiện giấu tên để thảo luận về các cuộc đàm phán ngoại giao kín, cảnh báo rằng cam kết này không phải là tuyệt đối và hoàn cảnh có thể thay đổi.

IRANSKI balistički projektili ciljali su danas privatnu rezidenciju izraelskog premijera Benjamina Netanyahua u Cezareji i elektranu u Haderi, izvijestila je Al Jazeera, pozivajući se na neimenovane izraelske medije.

### Izraelski mediji: Svi projektili su oboreni

The Jerusalem Post i The Times of Israel izvijestili su kako nije zabilježen udar niti jednog projektila, sugerirajući da su svi oboreni. Red Alert Tzofar objavio je uzbunu za opasnost od balističkih projektila nešto poslije 15 sati.

Podsjetimo, već treći dan traje sukob Izraela i Irana nakon što je Izrael pokrenuo napade na Iran kako bi uništio njihov nuklearni program. Iran je uzvratio udarima na Izrael, a u napadima su poginuli deseci ljudi s obje strane.

The Tienphong.vn article discusses a drone attack on Netanyahu's house, while the Index.hr article reports on Iranian ballistic missiles targeting the residence (<image:12175>).


## Elaboration
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. The image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a June 25, 2020 article by _Times of Israel_. The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024 is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it is not from a Hezbollah drone in August 2024. The image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a 2020 article.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea, dating back to 2019, as reported by _Times of Israel_ in 2020 ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).

_Fact check: Social media posts alleging Iranian military surveillance of Netanyahu have been proven false. Know more_

!Fact check: Viral post claiming Iranian drone tracked Netanyahu proven false; Know more <image:12275>

The viral image of Netanyahu | X

In June, Israel launched a surprise military strike on Iran, triggering a swift counterattack from Tehran. What began as a sudden escalation quickly spiralled into a prolonged and intense exchange, with the United States entering the fray through a series of coordinated airstrikes on Iranian targets over several weeks. The conflict reached a critical point when Iran retaliated with a missile strike on U.S. military bases in Qatar, raising fears of a broader regional war.

Twelve days after the Iranian missile strike, both Iran and the United States agreed to a cease-fire, temporarily halting hostilities and opening the door for potential negotiations aimed at de-escalation.

Amidst this, a viral post began circulating online, claiming that the Iranian military was secretly tracking every move of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A screenshot, allegedly from the X handle 'From Iran,' is being widely shared. It features an image of Netanyahu sitting in a room, appearing to be taken from outside with a drone.

The post accompanying the image reads:

“The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps captures a photo of the Israeli Prime Minister inside his office, publishes it, and writes: “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, upon investigation, it was found that several users on X had shared the same screenshot. Our verification revealed that the claim is false.

![placeholder](/images/placeholderimg.webp)

Screenshot of the circulating X-post

> [](https://twitter.com/x/status/1939964925897589186)

The image in the viral post shows Benjamin Netanyahu sitting in a room, viewed through a half-open window, with another person seated beside him. It is being circulated with the claim that it was captured by a drone. The shadow of the alleged drone appears on the closed window and the outer wall, making the image seem convincing at first glance. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that this image was released by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

A detailed investigation traced the original image to the stock photo website Getty Images, where it was uploaded on February 10, 2009. The accompanying caption states that the photo was taken on February 8, 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu meeting with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu, at his home in Jerusalem. The photographer is credited as Michael Fattal.

A comparison between Michael Fattal’s original photo and the viral screenshot reveals clear similarities. Netanyahu is seated in the same position in both images. The background elements, including the curtain and the framed picture on the wall, are identical. In the viral screenshot, only the arm of the person sitting next to Netanyahu is visible, which matches the father's dress in the original photo. A green-covered book on the table in front of Netanyahu is also visible in both images.

These details confirm that the original 2009 image by Michael Fattal has been edited and falsely circulated as if it were a recent drone-captured photo.

![placeholder](/images/placeholderimg.webp)

A comparison between the image published on Getty Images in 2009 and the one currently circulating on X reveals that the claim is false.

A thorough examination confirms that the viral image is an edited version of a photo taken by Michael Fattal in February 2009, showing Benjamin Netanyahu with his father.

The image is an edited version of a photo taken by Michael Fattal in February 2009. The original photo shows Benjamin Netanyahu with his father. The claim that the image was captured and published by Hezbollah in August 2024 is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is an edited version of a photo taken in 2009, not a recent capture by Hezbollah. The claim misrepresents the origin and context of the image.

`false`

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Multiple Iranian officials have reiterated the promise in the past days, with analysts suggesting that other Resistance forces like Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Ansarullah may join Tehran in its retaliation.

Your Message Some reports suggest Meta has been working in close cooperation with the American government to help identify targets sought by Israel.

The Israeli regime assassinated Haniyeh in a Tehran residence on July 31, only hours after he had attended the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

Questions and Answers: Israeli Military’s Use of Digital Tools in Gaza

[![A technologist with the Israeli military's Matzpen operational data and applications unit works at his station, at an Israel Defense Force base in Ramat Gan, Israel, June 11, 2023. The Israeli military reportedly uses surveillance technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital tools to help determine who or what to attack in Gaza and when.

Human Rights Watch found that four digital tools that the Israeli military is using in Gaza use faulty data and inexact approximations to inform military actions. Some tools rely on machine learning, which is the use of computerized systems that can draw inferences from data and recognize patterns without explicit instructions.

It has not been possible to document when and where these digital tools are being used or the extent to which these tools have been used in conjunction with other methods of information and intelligence collection. Based on reports, Israeli military officers are responsible for setting the threshold beyond which an individual can be marked as a target subject to attack.

The military has acknowledged the existence of a tool like Lavender [in very general terms](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-defence-forces-response-to-claims-about-use-of-lavender-ai-database-in-gaza)
, calling it a “database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources.”

A presentation and book by two Israeli officers provide important technical details. **What is** “**Where’s Daddy?**” **and how does it work?**

Based on media reports, “Where’s Daddy” is a tool that uses mobile phone location tracking to notify Israeli military operators when people who have been marked as military targets enter a specific location – according to reports, often a family home – where they can be attacked. A mobile phone is not a reliable proxy for a human target, as people, especially in conflict zones, may change numbers or devices during an emergency where access to networks and devices may frequently and suddenly change.

In addition, the most common methods for tracking cell phone location are through [triangulating cell tower locations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221568410_Accuracy_Characterization_of_Cell_Tower_Localization)
, called cell site location information, or through gaining access to a [mobile phone's GPS data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6638960/)

The Israeli military’s use of these digital tools risk Israeli forces violating international humanitarian law, in particular the laws of war concerning distinction between military targets and civilians, and the need to take all feasible precautions before an attack to minimize civilian harm.

Human Rights Watch research indicates that the tools apparently rely on ongoing and systematic Israeli surveillance of all Palestinian residents of Gaza, including with data collected prior to the current hostilities in a manner that is incompatible with international human rights law."

How Israeli intelligence tracked Iranian leaders in June strike? NYT reveals
============================================================================

30 August 2025 18:29

**Israel developed a new method for targeting key Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists during the 12-day conflict in June 2025.**

An analysis by The New York Times **[revealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/us/politics/israel-iran-assassination.html)
** that Israeli intelligence tracked high-ranking Iranian officials by monitoring the cell phones of bodyguards accompanying them. This strategy went undetected by Iran’s security and intelligence agencies.

On June 16, Israeli military aircraft struck an underground bunker on a mountainside in Tehran during an emergency session of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. Share it on social media!

!loading <image:12324> Present in the bunker were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the head of the judiciary, ministers of interior, defence, and intelligence, along with senior military commanders. While the leaders survived, several security personnel were killed in the explosions.

The attacks were part of a larger Israeli operation aimed at infiltrating the upper levels of the Iranian security apparatus. Intelligence experts also noted that the information the guards shared on social media inadvertently revealed the leaders’ whereabouts.

The operation was intended to eliminate top Iranian military officials in a secretive strike reminiscent of the notorious “Red Wedding” scenario from Game of Thrones.

## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

Revealed: Israeli military creating ChatGPT-like tool using vast collection of Palestinian surveillance data
============================================================================================================

This article is more than 5 months old

The powerful new AI model is designed to analyze intercepted communications – but experts say such systems can exacerbate biases and are prone to making mistakes

Israel’s military surveillance agency has used a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian communications to build a powerful artificial intelligence tool similar to ChatGPT that it hopes will transform its spying capabilities, an investigation by the Guardian can reveal.

The joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found Unit 8200 trained the AI model to understand spoken Arabic using large volumes of telephone conversations and text messages, obtained through its extensive surveillance of the occupied territories.

According to sources familiar with the project, the unit began building the model to create a sophisticated chatbot-like tool capable of answering questions about people it is monitoring and providing insights into the massive volumes of surveillance data it collects.

The elite eavesdropping agency, comparable in its capabilities with the US National Security Agency (NSA), accelerated its development of the system after the start of the war in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 in October 2023. I have more tools to know what every person in the West Bank is doing.”

Details of the new model’s scale sheds light on Unit 8200’s large-scale retention of the content of intercepted communications, enabled by what current and former Israeli and western intelligence officials described as its blanket surveillance of Palestinian telecommunications.

The project also illustrates how Unit 8200, like many spy agencies around the world, is seeking to harness advances in AI to perform complex analytical tasks and make sense of the huge volumes of information they routinely collect, which increasingly defy human processing alone.

A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) declined to answer the Guardian’s questions about the new LLM, but said the military “deploys various intelligence methods to identify and thwart terrorist activity by hostile organisations in the Middle East”.

A vast pool of Arabic-language communications
---------------------------------------------

Unit 8200 has developed an array of AI-powered tools in recent years. Now one of the world’s most widely used LLMs, ChatGPT is underpinned by so-called “foundation model”, a general-purpose AI trained on immense volumes of data and capable of responding to complex queries.

Initially, Israeli military intelligence struggled to build a model on this scale. Sayedoff said in his presentation the team building the LLM “focused only on the dialects that hate us”.

The UK’s spy agencies [are also developing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/01/uk-intelligence-spy-agencies-relax-burdensome-laws-ai-data-bpds)
 their own LLMs, which it is also said to be training with open-source datasets.

But several former US and UK security officials said Israel’s intelligence community appeared to be taking greater risks than its closest allies when integrating novel AI-based systems into intelligence analysis.

One former western spy chief said Israeli military intelligence’s extensive collection of the content of Palestinian communications allowed it to use AI in ways “that would not be acceptable” among intelligence agencies in countries with stronger oversight over the use of surveillance powers and handling of sensitive personal data.

Campbell, from Human Rights Watch, said using surveillance material to train an AI model was “invasive and incompatible with human rights”, and that as an occupying power Israel is obligated to protect Palestinians’ privacy rights. “We’re talking about highly personal data taken from people who are not suspected of a crime, being used to train a tool that could then help establish suspicion,” he added.

Nadim Nashif, director of 7amleh, a Palestinian digital rights and advocacy group, said Palestinians have “become subjects in Israel’s laboratory to develop these techniques and weaponise AI, all for the purpose of maintaining \[an\] apartheid and occupation regime where these technologies are being used to dominate a people, to control their lives”.

Several current and former Israeli intelligence officers familiar with smaller-scale machine learning models used by Unit 8200 – precursors to the foundation model – said AI made the blanket surveillance of Palestinians more effective as a form of control, particularly in the West Bank where they said it has contributed to a greater number of arrests.

Two of the sources said the models helped the IDF automatically analyse intercepted phone conversations by identifying Palestinians expressing anger at the occupation or desires to attack soldiers or people living in illegal settlements. “Mistakes are going to be made, and some of those mistakes may have very serious consequences,” she added.

In February, the [Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108)
 AI was likely used by intelligence officers to help select a target in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza in November 2023 that killed four people, including three teenage girls. It is not clear whether it has yet been deployed.

The efforts to build the large language model (LLM) – a deep learning system that generates human-like text – were partially revealed in a little-noticed public talk by a former military intelligence technologist who said he oversaw the project.

“We tried to create the largest dataset possible \[and\] collect all the data the state of Israel has ever had in Arabic,” the former official, Chaked Roger Joseph Sayedoff, told an audience at a military AI conference in Tel Aviv last year."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Actions
```
web_search("Ismail Haniyeh assassination July 31 2024 WhatsApp")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Human Rights Watch article ([https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza](https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/09/10/questions-and-answers-israeli-militarys-use-digital-tools-gaza)) discusses the Israeli military's use of digital tools, including mobile phone location tracking, using methods like cell tower triangulation and GPS data access (<image:k>). A Caliber.Az article ([https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike](https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike)) mentions Israeli intelligence tracking Iranian leaders by monitoring their bodyguards' cell phones and social media activity (<image:12313>, <image:12315>, <image:12317>, <image:12319>). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/06/israel-military-ai-surveillance)) reports on the Israeli military's use of AI, including a ChatGPT-like tool and Unit 8200's analysis of intercepted communications for target selection (<image:12325>, <image:12326>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, including mobile phone location tracking via cell tower triangulation and GPS data, as well as monitoring social media activity. While the initial evidence suggests a possible link between WhatsApp and the assassination, the new evidence broadens the scope of potential tracking methods used by Israeli intelligence.

The claim is neither confirmed nor refuted. The new evidence provides context on the methods used by Israeli intelligence, but it does not directly confirm or deny the use of WhatsApp in tracking Haniyeh.

To verify the claim, specific evidence linking WhatsApp to the tracking of Haniyeh is needed.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to a Tehran Times article published on August 19, 2024, Ismail Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement in the assassination of the Hamas leader, which occurred on July 31 in Tehran. Haniyeh was reportedly using WhatsApp to communicate with family members shortly before his death (<image:k>). An article from bne Gulf bureau, published on August 1, 2024, mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabled location tracking for the assassination on July 31, 2024. The Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) published an article on December 27, 2024, stating that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024 (<image:12303>). The article also mentions that Haniyeh was killed one day after attending the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that there are unconfirmed reports of spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, enabling location tracking for the assassination. Additionally, Haniyeh's son suggested WhatsApp's possible involvement. However, the evidence does not definitively confirm that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp.

The evidence does confirm that the assassination occurred on July 31, 2024, and that Israel admitted responsibility.

The claim is partially supported by the evidence, but the extent of WhatsApp's involvement is not fully verified. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

A Caliber.Az article ([https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike](https://caliber.az/en/post/how-israeli-intelligence-tracked-iranian-leaders-in-june-strike)) mentions Israeli intelligence tracking Iranian leaders by monitoring their bodyguards' cell phones and social media activity (<image:12313>, <image:12315>, <image:12317>, <image:12319>).

According to a Jerusalem Post article ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)), Iranian state media claimed that Israel uses mobile tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, including Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran (<image:k>). A Modern Diplomacy article ([https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/08/04/the-assassination-of-ismail-haniyeh-silent-digital-strikes/)) suggests that the assassination may have involved spyware, such as Pegasus, to access Haniyeh's private conversations and real-time location via WhatsApp (<image:k>).


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Iranian state media claimed Israel used mobile tracking to assassinate Haniyeh. Additionally, a Modern Diplomacy article suggests the assassination may have involved spyware, like Pegasus, to access Haniyeh's conversations and location via WhatsApp.

The claim is supported by the evidence, as it indicates a possible link between Israeli intelligence, WhatsApp, and the tracking of Haniyeh.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while there are unconfirmed reports and suggestions of WhatsApp's involvement in tracking Ismail Haniyeh, the evidence is not conclusive. However, the search results indicate that Israeli intelligence uses various digital tools for tracking, and there are claims and suggestions that spyware, possibly including WhatsApp, was used in the assassination.

Given the evidence, the claim is not definitively proven, but there are indications of a possible link between Israeli intelligence, WhatsApp, and the tracking of Haniyeh. Therefore, the most appropriate decision option is `false`.

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
Based on the evidence, the claim is neither definitively confirmed nor refuted. While there are unconfirmed reports and suggestions of WhatsApp's involvement in tracking Ismail Haniyeh, the evidence is not conclusive. However, there are claims and suggestions that spyware, possibly including WhatsApp, was used in the assassination.

Photo of Turkish man holding hand of dead daughter underlines earthquake despair

Image showing father from Kahramanmaraş region comes as death toll from Syria and Turkey quake pushes past 7,800

Videos and photographs of the two earthquakes that have devastated southern Turkey and northern Syria, killing at least 7,800 people, show rescuers digging with their hands, apartment blocks concertinaing to the ground in seconds, and the shaking apart of a [castle](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/06/fears-for-ancient-sites-after-earthquake-destroys-parts-of-gaziantep-castle-turkey)
 that had stood for almost two millennia.

But few images depict the agony quite as plainly as a photograph from the Turkish region of Kahramanmaraş, in which a father holds the hand of his dead teenage daughter as rescuers and civilians pick through the flattened building where she died on Monday.

Sitting hunched in the rubble, Mesut Hancer keeps hold of 15-year-old Irmak as she lies on her bed beneath the slabs of concrete, smashed windows and broken bricks that were once apartments. Close to the father and daughter, a man with a sledgehammer tries to smash his way through the ruins.

The epicentre of the first earthquake was the Pazarcık district of Kahramanmaraş, which lies in south-east [Turkey](https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey)
. The initial, 7.8-magnitude earthquake was followed, hours later, by a second quake that measured 7.7 magnitude.

Elsewhere in Kahramanmaraş province, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble. One lay on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Rescuers quieted the throngs of people trying to help so they could hear survivors and find them.

On the other side of the border, the Associated Press described seeing a Syrian man holding a dead girl in his arms as he walked away from the debris of a collapsed two-storey building.

He and a woman set the girl on the floor under covering to protect her from the rain, wrapping her in a large blanket before looking back to the building. According to Agence France-Presse, [a newborn baby was pulled alive from the rubble](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/syria-newborn-still-joined-to-dead-mother-pulled-alive-from-earthquake-rubble)
 of a home in northern Syria after relatives found her still tied by her umbilical cord to her mother, who died in Monday’s quake.

Rescue efforts are being hampered by dozens of continuing aftershocks, freezing winter weather and the damage caused to roads leading in and out of the affected areas.

On Tuesday evening, the Turkish government said 4,500 people had been killed in the quake, with another 26,000 injured. The number of confirmed deaths on the Syrian side of the border – where the disaster has exacerbated the destruction wrought by more than 11 years of civil war – stood at at least 1,700 bringing the death toll in both countries to more than 6,200. Turkey’s disaster management agency said it had 11,342 reports of collapsed buildings, of which 5,775 had been confirmed.

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, declared the 10 provinces affected by the earthquakes disaster zones, imposing a state of emergency in the region for three months.

As men clamber over the ruins of the pancaked building, now shaped like a pyramid of rubble, one man sits still. 

Wearing an orange coat to protect himself from the winter freeze, Mesut Hançer perches on concrete slabs and twisted rebar — all that remains of the apartment block in Kahramanmaras, a Turkish city close to [the epicenter of Monday’s earthquake](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/oliveburd/turkey-syria-earthquake-photos)
. 

His face is still — his expression, blank. He is grief-stricken but resolute: He won’t let go of his daughter’s hand. 

  ! <image:12479>

Irmak, 15, was killed when the building collapsed. The girl’s body is sandwiched between a mattress, dirt, and the colossal weight of the upper floors of the building. All that peeks out is a lifeless, pale hand that her father steadfastly grips. 

“He never left the hand of his daughter who died in the earthquake,” wrote Adem Atlan, the photographer with Agence France-Presse who took the pictures of the grieving father on Tuesday, in an Instagram story uploaded Wednesday. 

"Unbelievable pain," he later [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/CochRLEq1H8/)
.

Adem Altan / AFP via Getty Images

Altan’s photos [went viral online](https://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/1622977020194959360)
 and were printed on newspaper front pages around the world on Wednesday from Turkey to Spain to the UK to the US. 

“With the courage of despair,” read the headline accompanying the photo in [Belgium's De Standaard newspaper](https://www.standaard.be/krant/archief)
. 

“A glimpse of pain and desperation among the ruins,” Brazil’s O Globo paper wrote in its headline for the picture. 

A 2015 photo of Mesut and Irmak uploaded by the girl [to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=846968168721806&set=pb.100002258936209.-2207520000.&type=3)
 shows the father and daughter smiling as they pose by a small water fountain. Almost eight years later, a different photo of the pair has been seen across the globe and become a defining image of tragedy.

Irmak is just one of a horrifyingly large number of people killed by Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has devastated large swaths of Turkey and neighboring Syria.

More than 20,000 people are known to have died, according to [tallies from the Associated Press on Thursday](https://apnews.com/article/politics-syria-government-damascus-turkey-6ba6f153102945d93340dbf55e63d4bf)
, making the disaster one of the deadliest of the last decade. 

There are few more traumatized corners of the globe that the quake could have struck than Syria’s northwest. 

That country, plagued for more than a decade by a civil war that has wrought devastation and triggered a global refugee crisis, already had 15 million people in need of humanitarian aid even before the tremor began, according to David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee.

“One of the deadliest earthquakes this century, followed by hundreds of aftershocks, now adds to a litany of devastation,” Miliband said in a statement shared with BuzzFeed News, calling for aid to begin “skyrocketing” in order to meet the desperate need.

Search and rescue efforts in the Besnaya district of Idlib, Syria, on Thursday. 

On Thursday, three days after the quake, the first convoy of aid trucks finally reached the opposition-held Idlib area in Syria’s northwest. The trucks arrived via the only crossing with the Turkish border that the United Nations has authorized for use but that had been blocked for days by damage.  

However, the White Helmets, a humanitarian group that assists in the region, said the aid was merely the same supplies that had preceded the disaster. “It is not special aid and equipment for the search and rescue teams, and the recovery of those trapped under the rubble,” the group [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SyriaCivilDef/status/1623667466860740608)
. “We are disappointed at a time when we are desperate for equipment that will help us save lives from under the rubble.”

Almost 2,000 people have died in the region, according to the White Helmets. Many of the dead had fled destruction and violence elsewhere in Syria only to lose their lives when buildings collapsed there.

As time passes, hopes dim that more people will be found alive — but there are still miracles. On Thursday, the White Helmets shared a photo of a young girl named Sham being pulled from the rubble. The group said her two siblings were also saved, but their mother was killed. 

Among the international figures who have arrived in the region to assist in relief and recovery efforts are a small contingent of 87 rescue workers from Ukraine, which itself has been plagued by war for the past year.

 of the workers searching damaged buildings in Turkey for signs of life.

"Our first task is search and rescue operations — to find the living people!” spokesperson Oleksandr Khorunzhiy [said](https://www.facebook.com/MNS.GOV.UA/posts/pfbid02pY78BwEzgveGq9rCJ14ZwhcSs4zk4iNjdKCypYG3aLEgRiuyRmEf86W4QoAY2GVql)

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:10257>) shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey. The event occurred in February 2023, not July 2024, and the location was Turkey, not Gaza.

The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/07/turkey-earthquake-man-photo-dead-daughter-hand)), BuzzFeed News ([https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/earthquake-turkey-syria-photo-father-daughter-hand)), and CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/13/middleeast/turkey-quake-man-daughter-hand-photo-intl)) all published articles about the image.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts Mesut Hancer in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in February 2023. The event occurred in Turkey, not Gaza, and the date was February 2023, not July 2024.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows a man in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter after an earthquake in February 2023, not in Gaza in July 2024. The claim misrepresents the location, date, and context of the image. `false`

 [! The quote also says that the Israeli government and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are “heartless criminals without a drop of humanity.” The same wording has been circulated on Russian-language [pages](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid0SRBRLHpy3yUgpPSRqKTJB2yPeDom8hSAuiBumfx2B1Xexvszh93Ete8hJHQfRWx3l&id=100070217693211)

**The quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is fake. No such statement appears on any of the actor’s official pages, nor has it been reported by any reputable media outlet.**

The quote about the Gaza Strip and the Israeli government, allegedly made by Dwayne Johnson, is fabricated. Johnson expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.

__Screenshot of Dwayne Johnson’s post__

Alongside Georgian and Russian-speaking users, English-language accounts have also been [sharing](https://x.com/Global_Lens_New/status/1948547511427211477)
 the fake quote. The fabricated statement has also been [fact-checked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-israel-gaza-netanyahu/)
 by the organization Snopes.

The appearance of the fake quote may be directly connected to events that occurred at the end of July. The city had been considered a key hub for the delivery of humanitarian aid in Gaza.

**About the Source:**

Among others, the fake quote attributed to Dwayne Johnson is being spread by a Facebook account belonging to [Zaal Mamatsashvili](https://www.facebook.com/zaal.mamatsashvili/posts/pfbid02ZV5icDdtmZzamBaPfkzkBa1LbrBuTVdevkkWGkfsuRSLoZVoFnzTAvrBqKq47j7l)

'Worst-case scenario' famine crisis in Gaza

The quote attributed to Johnson began circulating online in late July, at around the same time the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification [said](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/countries-in-focus-archive/issue-133/en/)
 on July 29 that, due to Israel's ongoing military offensive and [blockade](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-30-2025-9b9b516f22e61bd1dde879733fdd97aa)
, about 2 million Palestinians in Gaza were living in the "worst-case scenario of famine."

For further reading, a previous fact-check article [examined](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-tiktok-video-wrongly-192800744.html)
 whether a video truly showed actor Harrison Ford calling pro-Palestinian supporters a "force of nature."

#### Sources:

"IPC ALERT: Worst-Case Scenario of Famine Unfolding in the Gaza Strip." _Integrated Food Security Phase Classification_, 29 Jul. In that user's July 24 post, the quote had a different ending, reading, "The Israeli government and its Prime Minister Netanyahu are sons of a b\*\*\*\*."

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.
