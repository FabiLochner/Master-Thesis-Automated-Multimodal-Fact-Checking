Useful result: From [Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-strikes-military-tanks-in-southern-syria): 
Content: The PBS News article, published on July 14, 2025, reports on Israeli strikes on military tanks in southern Syria. <image:12070> The article mentions clashes between government forces, Bedouin tribes, and Druze militias in Syria's Sweida province. It also mentions that in May, Israeli forces struck a site near the presidential palace in Damascus.

The claim '<image:10240> This image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in Syria in December 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Israeli tanks, and while the Israeli army has been active in Syria, including near Damascus, the evidence does not confirm the image's exact location. Therefore, the claim is likely false.

So, the overall veracity is: false
