## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 22, 2024, CNN reported that Kamala Harris was in Maryland and declined to preside over Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, and that Harris and Netanyahu will meet separately later in the week. The article also states that Harris is expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself (<image:k>). The Washington Post also reported that Harris declined to preside over the Senate chamber when Netanyahu addresses a joint meeting of Congress.

Al-Monitor reported on Netanyahu's visit to Washington and that he is scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris. The article also notes that Harris is seen to the left of Biden on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (![image 11420](media/2025-08-30_23-50-1756597813-128764.jpg), ![image 11421](media/2025-08-30_23-50-1756597817-866228.jpg), ![image 11422](media/2025-08-30_23-50-1756597818-232948.jpg), ![image 11423](media/2025-08-30_23-50-1756597818-742729.jpg), ![image 11424](media/2025-08-30_23-50-1756597819-364330.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on July 22, 2024, Kamala Harris was expected to underscore a commitment to ensuring Israel can defend itself. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state the exact quote from the claim.

Therefore, I need more information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The NPR article from August 23, 2024, reports that Kamala Harris met with Benjamin Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and stated her "unwavering commitment to Israel," including standing up for Israel's right to defend itself. The USA TODAY article from July 23, 2024, discusses Harris's statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict, mentioning her reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself. Al-Monitor's article from July 23, 2024, discusses Harris's stance on Israel and the Gaza war, noting that she is expected to adopt a slightly more critical approach to Israel's military conduct and will not preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Kamala Harris expressed support for Israel. However, the provided evidence does not contain the exact quote from the claim. The evidence mentions Harris's "unwavering commitment to Israel" and reaffirmation of Israel's right to defend itself, but not the specific phrase "Our support for Israel will continue."

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.ibtimes.sg/fact-check-did-kamala-harris-say-our-support-israel-will-continue-75435): 
Content: The International Business Times published an article on July 26, 2024, stating that no evidence has been found of Kamala Harris using the words "Our support for Israel will continue" during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit or at any other time in recent months. The article rates the claim as "False." The article mentions a post on X (formerly Twitter) that included the quote, which garnered over 9 million views. The article also notes that Harris met with Netanyahu on July 25, 2024, and that she has supported Israel while also advocating for a cease-fire and increased humanitarian aid. <image:43822>, <image:69778>, <image:59008>


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. A fact-check from the International Business Times found no evidence of Kamala Harris using the exact quote "Our support for Israel will continue" during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit or in recent months.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while Kamala Harris expressed support for Israel around the time of Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, there is no evidence to support the specific quote "Our support for Israel will continue." The International Business Times fact-check explicitly states that no evidence of this quote has been found.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. A fact-check by the International Business Times found no evidence that Kamala Harris said, "Our support for Israel will continue" during Benjamin Netanyahu's visit or in recent months, despite her expressing support for Israel.
