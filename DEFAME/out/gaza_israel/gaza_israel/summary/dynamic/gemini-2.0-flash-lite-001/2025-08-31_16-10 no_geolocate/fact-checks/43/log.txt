Useful result: From [Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html): 
Content: The Yahoo article fact-checks the quote "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine." attributed to Anthony Bourdain. The article states that there is no credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement. The oldest version of the quote found with Bourdain's name attached was from July 2021. Similar statements without Bourdain's name attached go back to 2013. The article mentions Bourdain's visit to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for a CNN show episode, which resulted in noteworthy comments and tweets. <image:12665> The article also includes a tweet from Bourdain from June 12, 2013, with a photo from Gaza.

The claim 'Anthony Bourdain once said, 'Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Anthony Bourdain said, "Today, nearly everything is made in China. Except for courage. Courage is made in Palestine," is not supported by evidence. A fact-check from Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-anthony-bourdain-once-140000174.html)) indicates that there is no credible record of Bourdain making this exact statement.

So, the overall veracity is: false
