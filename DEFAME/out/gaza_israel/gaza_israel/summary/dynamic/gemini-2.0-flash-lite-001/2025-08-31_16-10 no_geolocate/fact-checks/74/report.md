## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 19, 2024, a drone attack targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216). The attack was claimed by Hezbollah on October 22, 2024, according to Wikipedia. Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack, and there were no injuries. The IDF confirmed a drone crossing from Lebanon.

The Times of Israel article includes a tweet from Benjamin Netanyahu describing the attack as an assassination attempt. ![image 5540](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913514-658764.jpg), ![image 5541](media/2025-08-23_01-45-1755913515-076396.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by multiple news sources ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216)). However, the provided information does not mention Yair Netanyahu being present or killed in the attack.

The evidence states that Netanyahu and his wife were not present during the attack and that there were no injuries. Therefore, the claim that Yair Netanyahu was killed in the drone attack is not supported by the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The drone attack on October 19, 2024, targeted Benjamin Netanyahu's residence, but the provided evidence does not mention Yair Netanyahu being present or killed in the attack. The sources state that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a drone attack did occur on October 19, 2024, targeting Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), the provided evidence indicates that Netanyahu and his wife were not present and there were no injuries. There is no mention of Yair Netanyahu being killed in the attack.
