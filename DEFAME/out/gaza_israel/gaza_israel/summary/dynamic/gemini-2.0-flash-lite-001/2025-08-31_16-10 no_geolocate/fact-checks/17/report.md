## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Columbian reports that a US-flagged container ship was targeted in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday, with the captain reporting an explosion near Nishtun, Yemen. The British military identified the ship as the Maersk Sentosa, and the Houthis claimed responsibility. The article is dated August 31, 2025. ([https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/](https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jul/10/yemens-houthi-rebels-target-a-us-flagged-container-ship-in-the-gulf-of-aden/)) The U.S. Navy Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) reported a missile attack on August 3, 2024, targeting the Liberia-flagged container ship GROTON, and two explosions near a Panama-flagged bulk carrier on August 21, 2024. ([https://www.oni.navy.mil/oni-reports/shipping-threat-reports/wts-archive/fileid/150772/](https://www.oni.navy.mil/oni-reports/shipping-threat-reports/wts-archive/fileid/150772/)) Reuters reported on July 19, 2024, that Houthi rebels hit and damaged the Singapore-flagged container ship Lobivia with two missiles in the Gulf of Aden. ![image 13522](media/2025-08-31_16-21-1756657308-030635.jpg) ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-hit-by-projectiles-southeast-yemens-aden-ukmto-says-2024-07-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-hit-by-projectiles-southeast-yemens-aden-ukmto-says-2024-07-19/))


### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 9, 2024, Reuters reported that Yemen's Houthis claimed to have targeted the "Maersk Sentosa" in the Arabian Sea with missiles. Maersk confirmed that the U.S.-flagged vessel was targeted by a flying object in the northern Gulf of Aden. No injuries or damage were reported. ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/vessel-reports-nearby-explosion-east-yemens-nishtun-ukmto-says-2024-07-09/))

An attack on the commercial vessel Maersk Hangzhou on December 30, 2023, in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden is also documented. The Houthis were involved in the attack, which led Maersk to pause and later halt shipping through the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden.

## Elaboration
The claim is partially verifiable. According to Reuters, on July 9, 2024, the Maersk Sentosa, a U.S.-flagged vessel, was targeted in the Gulf of Aden. Maersk confirmed the attack. The Houthis claimed responsibility.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate. There was an attack on a US-flagged vessel, the Maersk Sentosa, in the Gulf of Aden in July 2024. A Maersk spokesperson confirmed the attack.
