## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 53](media/84.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) is of Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s private residence in Caesarea. According to a PesaCheck article published on August 28, 2024, the image is from 2019 and was featured in a Times of Israel article ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).

The Times of Israel website ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/prime-ministers-residence/)) published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone attack on Netanyahu's home, but the image is not present in the article. The image was also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow" ([https://beyondhighbrow.substack.com/](https://beyondhighbrow.substack.com/)).


## Elaboration
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence in Caesarea. However, the image is from 2019, not August 2024, as claimed. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article.

The claim that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone is not supported by the evidence. A PesaCheck article states that the image is from 2019.


## Final Judgement
The claim is false because the image is from 2019, not August 2024, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it is from 2019, not August 2024, as the claim suggests. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone, as reported by a PesaCheck article ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).
