## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The BBC article discusses the return of the bodies of Israeli hostages in February 2025. The Times of Israel and Euronews reported on a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where protesters carried mock coffins draped with Israeli flags to represent hostages held in Gaza, demanding their release. ![image 4533](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-466872.jpg), ![image 4535](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911055-848473.jpg), ![image 4537](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911061-234441.jpg), ![image 4538](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911062-238270.jpg), ![image 4539](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911063-664037.jpg), ![image 49](media/80.jpg)

The protest, as reported by Euronews, involved people carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags. The protesters were angry with the Israeli government.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website contains an image of coffins draped with Israeli flags (![image 4548](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911083-761452.jpg)). Al Jazeera published an article about Hamas stating that Gaza captives will return in coffins if Israel continues raids, which includes an image of a protest (![image 4549](media/2025-08-23_01-04-1755911083-936573.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages held in Gaza. The evidence indicates that the coffins were not of dead Israeli soldiers, but rather a symbolic representation of the hostages.


## Final Judgement
The claim is inaccurate. The image shows a protest using mock coffins to represent hostages, not dead soldiers. The evidence from multiple sources confirms this. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows a protest in Tel Aviv on September 5, 2024, where mock coffins draped with Israeli flags were used to represent hostages held in Gaza, not dead soldiers, as reported by the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-oct-7-israel-hamas-war/).
