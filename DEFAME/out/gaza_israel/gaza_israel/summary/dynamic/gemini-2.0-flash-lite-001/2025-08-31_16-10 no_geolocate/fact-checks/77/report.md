## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that multiple sources reported an earthquake in Israel on October 5, 2024. The Johns Hopkins University article ([https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/02/04/earthquake-nuclear-test-misinformation/](https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/02/04/earthquake-nuclear-test-misinformation/)) mentions it, and NDTV ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/earthquakes-in-iran-and-israel-sparks-speculation-of-nuclear-tests-6735904](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/earthquakes-in-iran-and-israel-sparks-speculation-of-nuclear-tests-6735904)) also reported on it.

The evidence also indicates that the earthquake in Israel was linked to an earthquake in Iran on the same date, which led to speculation about nuclear tests.
