## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 59](media/92.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli airstrikes killed at least 90 Palestinians and injured over 300. ![image 59](media/92.jpg) The CNN article, published on July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where at least 30 people were killed. ![image 59](media/92.jpg) The NPR article, published on July 27, 2024, reports on an Israeli airstrike that hit a school being used as a shelter in Gaza, resulting in at least 30 deaths, including children. ![image 12318](media/2025-08-31_12-23-1756643006-470242.jpg), ![image 12319](media/2025-08-31_12-23-1756643006-769134.jpg)

The articles can be found here: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_July_2024_al-Mawasi_attack), [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/27/middleeast/israel-gaza-deir-al-balah-school-intl), [Source](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/27/nx-s1-5054283/gaza-school-shelter-deaths-israeli-airstrike).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. The search results mention attacks on July 13 and July 27, 2024. The image search did not provide any information about the image.

The claim states that the image shows a Palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024. While the evidence confirms Israeli airstrikes in Gaza during July 2024, it does not confirm the image's context.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm the image's context.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include an article from Al Jazeera about the impact of the Israeli war on Gaza's children, featuring an image of children near rubble (![image 13961](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660147-082443.jpg)

## Elaboration
The image search provides an image of children near rubble in Gaza, which supports the claim's context. However, the search results do not include the original image.

I still cannot verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm the image's context.

The Alamy search result ([https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/palestinian-child-in-rubble.html](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/palestinian-child-in-rubble.html)) contains stock photos and images of a Palestinian child in rubble. ![image 13973](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660170-378901.jpg), ![image 13968](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660168-336512.jpg), ![image 13969](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660168-637960.jpg), ![image 13982](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660175-551944.jpg), ![image 13984](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660176-563145.jpg), ![image 13988](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660182-134129.jpg), ![image 13970](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660168-923334.jpg), ![image 13961](media/2025-08-31_17-09-1756660147-082443.jpg)


## Elaboration
The web search results confirm the existence of images depicting Palestinian children in rubble, injured, and affected by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. However, the evidence does not provide the original image's context.

I still cannot verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm the image's context.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024 and that children were affected. However, the search results do not provide the original image's context. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While there is evidence of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024 and images of children affected by the attacks, the provided evidence does not confirm the specific context of the image in the claim.
