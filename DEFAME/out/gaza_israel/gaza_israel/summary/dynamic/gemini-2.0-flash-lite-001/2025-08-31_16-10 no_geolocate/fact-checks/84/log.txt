The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's private residence, but it is from 2019, not August 2024, as the claim suggests. The image was featured in a Times of Israel article, and there is no evidence to support the claim that it was taken by a Hezbollah drone, as reported by a PesaCheck article ([https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)).
