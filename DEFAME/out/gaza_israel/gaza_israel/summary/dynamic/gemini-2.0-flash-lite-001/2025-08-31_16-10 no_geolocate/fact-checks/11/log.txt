The claim 'The chief of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), Herzi Halevi, was assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base on October 13, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli military base did occur on October 13, 2024, as reported by sources like [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-iran-gaza-attack-10-14-24-intl-hnk) and [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/4-soldiers-killed-in-drone-strike-named-as-families-ask-why-there-was-no-warning-siren/), the evidence does not support the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
