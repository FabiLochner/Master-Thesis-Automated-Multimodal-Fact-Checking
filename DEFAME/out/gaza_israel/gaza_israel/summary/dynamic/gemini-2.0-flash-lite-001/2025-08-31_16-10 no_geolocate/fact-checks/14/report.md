Content: The Times of India published an article on May 14, 2025, about a toilet explosion in Noida, India, that caused severe burns to a young man. ![image 12](media/14.jpg) The article suggests the explosion may have been caused by methane gas buildup from clogged drains.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss the explosion of pagers distributed by Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria on September 17, 2024. One source suggests Israel was responsible for the explosions, which targeted walkie-talkies and resulted in at least 12 deaths and 2,800 injuries. Another source mentions an Israeli attack on Hezbollah using rigged pagers in Lebanon in 2024, causing explosions in homes, offices, and shops. The Human Rights Watch article, published on September 18, 2024, reports on the explosions and includes a photograph of people outside a hospital emergency room in Beirut, Lebanon.
