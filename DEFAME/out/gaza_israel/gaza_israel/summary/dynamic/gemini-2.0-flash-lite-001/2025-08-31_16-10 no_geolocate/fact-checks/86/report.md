## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. The image (![image 55](media/86.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The image provided was taken on June 8, 2024, and is associated with the USS Mount Whitney's arrival in Kiel, Germany, after completing BALTOPS 24, a maritime exercise in the Baltic region. The claim states the image shows U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.

The claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image provided in the claim is of U.S. Navy ships and was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea, not in August 2024 en route to Lebanon. While there were reports of U.S. military deployments to the Middle East in August 2024, the image does not depict this. Therefore, the claim is false.
