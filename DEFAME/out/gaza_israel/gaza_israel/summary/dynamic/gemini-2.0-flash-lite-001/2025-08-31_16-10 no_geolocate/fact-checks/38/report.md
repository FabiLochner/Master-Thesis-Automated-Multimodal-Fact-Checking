## Final Judgement
The image in the claim is of the residence of Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was killed in a US drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. The claim is therefore false. The web search confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, but the image does not depict this event.
