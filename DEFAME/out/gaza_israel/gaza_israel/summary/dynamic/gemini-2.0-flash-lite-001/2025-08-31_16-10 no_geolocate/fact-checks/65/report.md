A UN News article ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461)) mentions a strike on a UN compound in Deir Al Balah. The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/21/gaza-israel-war-latest-situation-updates-live-news)) reported on an air and ground assault on Deir al-Balah in July, with at least eight reported deaths.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/23/middleeast/israel-intensifies-southern-gaza-offensive-intl): 
Content: CNN published an article on March 23, 2025, about Israel intensifying its offensive in southern Gaza. The article includes an image of a crowd at night. ![image 13850](media/2025-08-31_16-48-1756658930-458620.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, and that there were casualties. The image search found an image of a crowd at night, which is similar to the image in the claim. However, the evidence still does not explicitly confirm that the image ![image 39](media/65.jpg)

## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Deir al-Balah in March 2025, and that there were casualties. However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image in the claim is from that specific event. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. `false`

Sources like a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip) and a [UN News article](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461) confirm the attacks, but the image's origin remains unconfirmed.
