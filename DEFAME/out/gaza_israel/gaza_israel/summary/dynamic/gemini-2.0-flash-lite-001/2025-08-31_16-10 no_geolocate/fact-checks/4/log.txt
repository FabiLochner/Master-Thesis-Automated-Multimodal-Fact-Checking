Useful result: From [Source](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-22/us-air-strikes-hit-houthi-targets-in-yemen/104755402): 
Content: ABC News reports that the U.S. launched air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024. <image:13481>

The claim '<image:5> This image shows the U.S. bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024 in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially accurate. The U.S. did launch airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024, as reported by sources like The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/us-says-conducted-strikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemens-capital](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/us-says-conducted-strikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemens-capital)). However, the claim that the strikes were in reprisal for a Houthi attack on Israel's capital is not supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: false
