## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that children have been found under the rubble of destroyed homes in Gaza. The BBC and PBS News articles mention children being found in the rubble after Israeli airstrikes. However, the evidence does not provide information about the specific image in the claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence does not confirm the image's authenticity or the specific details provided in the claim.
