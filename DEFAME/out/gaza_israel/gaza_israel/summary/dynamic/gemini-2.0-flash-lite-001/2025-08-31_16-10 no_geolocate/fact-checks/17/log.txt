Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_the_MV_Maersk_Hangzhou): 
Content: The Wikipedia article "Attacks on the MV Maersk Hangzhou" details an attack on December 30, 2023, in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The attack was part of the Red Sea crisis and Operation Prosperity Guardian. The Houthis attacked the commercial vessel Maersk Hangzhou. The result was a Houthi victory, with Maersk pausing shipping through the Red Sea for 48 hours and later halting all shipping through the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden. The U.S. sank Houthi attack boats. The article also mentions the involvement of the Yemeni Navy and the U.S. Navy.
