Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381): Found exact image on website with title: Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping ...
Content: NDTV published an article titled "Gaza's Youngest Hostage: Hamas Says He's Dead, Family Hoping Against Hope". The article discusses the Bibas family, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The article mentions that Hamas claimed Shiri and her two sons are no longer alive, while Israeli officials have not confirmed this. The article includes an image of Kfir Bibas.

The claim '<image:21> This image shows a screenshot of an authentic BBC article from February 2025 with the title 'Hamas just wanted to protect the Bibas family but Israel killed them - Hamas said.'' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the image in the claim is from a BBC article, the title presented in the claim does not match the actual title of the BBC article, which is "Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family" ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
