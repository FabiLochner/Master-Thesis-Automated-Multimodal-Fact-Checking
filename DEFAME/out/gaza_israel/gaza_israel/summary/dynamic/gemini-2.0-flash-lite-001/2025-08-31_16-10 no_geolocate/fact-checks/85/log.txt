Useful result: From [Source](https://theintercept.com/2024/08/09/israel-prison-sde-teiman-palestinian-abuse-torture/): 
Content: The Intercept published an article that includes an image with the Channel 12 logo. <image:13936>

The claim '<image:54> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic question from Israel's Channel 12 public opinion poll: 'Do you agree with the claim that a solder is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied?'' is false.
Justification: The image is a manipulated screenshot from Israel's Channel 12 news, as confirmed by multiple sources ([https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/](https://cedmohub.eu/posts-share-doctored-prisoner-abuse-poll-from-israeli-tv-channel/)). The original broadcast featured a different question, and the claim presented is a fabrication.

So, the overall veracity is: false
