The claim 'Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including a November 5, 2024, article from [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5179904/israel-defense-minister-gallant-fired-netanyahu), indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after the alleged attack and was later fired. Additionally, [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-iranian-missiles-hit-base-gallant-says-attack-didnt-even-scratch-air-force/) published an article about the attack on October 1, 2024, including a photo of Gallant, and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/8/israeli-defence-minister-yoav-gallant-cancels-pentagon-visit) reported on his activities after the attack.
