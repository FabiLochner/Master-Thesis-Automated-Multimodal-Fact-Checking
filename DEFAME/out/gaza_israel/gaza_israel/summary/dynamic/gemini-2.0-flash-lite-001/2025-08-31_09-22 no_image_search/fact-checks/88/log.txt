Useful result: From [Source](https://iranwire.com/en/politics/134733-irans-quds-force-chief-esmail-qaani-missing-after-beirut-airstrikes/): 
Content: The IranWire article, published on October 7, 2024, reports that Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Quds Force, was missing after Beirut airstrikes. The article mentions his absence from a ceremony and that the last confirmed sighting of Qaani was on September 29. The article also notes speculation on social media regarding his disappearance.

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the evidence. While the image is of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, wearing a hijab, the provided sources do not confirm that the image is authentic or that he was disguised in fear of Israeli bombing. The evidence points to speculation and rumors surrounding his whereabouts and health, particularly around October 2024, amid reports of Israeli strikes, but does not validate the specific reason for the disguise.

So, the overall veracity is: false
