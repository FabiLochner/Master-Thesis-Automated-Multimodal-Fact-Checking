Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) and the Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland is offering protection to Benjamin Netanyahu, potentially due to an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) <image:k>.

DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>. The article also stated that Netanyahu was not planning to attend the event <image:k>.


## Elaboration
1.  The provided evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland offered protection to Netanyahu, potentially related to an ICC arrest warrant.
2.  The evidence does not mention any missile attacks on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it state that Netanyahu fled to Poland amid such an attack.
3.  The evidence suggests that Netanyahu was not planning to attend an event in Poland.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, as reported by Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)), NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)), and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)). The attack, also known as "Operation True Promise II," involved approximately 200 ballistic missiles. Benjamin Netanyahu responded, stating Iran "will pay" for the attack <image:k>.

The attack was in response to Israeli actions in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders. During the attacks, the Israeli Security Cabinet convened in a bunker in Jerusalem.


## Elaboration
1.  The new evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.
2.  The evidence states that Netanyahu responded to the attack and that the Israeli Security Cabinet convened in a bunker in Jerusalem.
3.  The evidence does not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland during this attack. The available information indicates that Netanyahu responded to the attack and the Israeli Security Cabinet convened in a bunker.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland during the attack. Instead, evidence suggests he responded to the attack, and the Israeli Security Cabinet convened in a bunker.
