## Claim
Claim: "![image 60](media/93.jpg) This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 60](media/93.jpg))
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
geolocate(![image 60](media/93.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 60](media/93.jpg)

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (![image 2525](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009980-789318.jpg), ![image 2528](media/2025-07-20_11-13-1753009983-275614.jpg))


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.


## Actions
```
web_search("airport israel after houthi attack july 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source discusses a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport, which caused a temporary suspension of flights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport)). Another source, from NPR, reports on a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and includes images of the damage (![image 11869](media/2025-08-31_11-12-1756638748-594725.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The search results also mention a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly link the image to the July 19, 2024, attack or the 2025 attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.

The claim is missing information that directly connects the image to the aftermath of the Houthi attack on July 19, 2024.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israel airport security after houthi attack july 19 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The CNN article from July 19, 2024, reports on a drone attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, claimed by Yemenâ€™s Houthi rebels, which resulted in one death and injuries. The Al-Monitor article from July 20, 2024, discusses Israeli strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, which occurred a day after the Tel Aviv drone attack. The articles include images of the damage (![image 11874](media/2025-08-31_11-12-1756638774-432590.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. However, the search results do not provide any information about airport security or people fleeing the airport after the attack. The image's context remains unverified.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a crowd of people in an airport, and the claim asserts that it depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after a Houthi attack on July 19, 2024. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on that date, the evidence does not confirm that the image is related to the attack or that people were fleeing the airport. Therefore, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While there was a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, the provided evidence does not link the image to the attack or confirm that it depicts people fleeing the airport. The image shows a crowd of people in an airport, but there is no evidence to support the claim's assertion that it is related to the Houthi attack.
