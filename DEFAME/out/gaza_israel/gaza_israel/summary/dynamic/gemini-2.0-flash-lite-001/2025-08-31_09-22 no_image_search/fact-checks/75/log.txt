Useful result: From [Source](https://www.linegear.com/product-category/fire-shelters/?srsltid=AfmBOoqd2HFVsmG5wtsP7feHOu6JkDjwx5G8GPTalNrPHXtnY3Q1Ekwd): 
Content: The search result from LineGear.com discusses fire shelters, which are portable tent-like coverings for firefighters. <image:11709>, <image:11710>, <image:11711>, <image:11713>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_shelter): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses fire shelters used by wildland firefighters. It describes the construction of fire shelters, their effectiveness, and their history, including an image of a deployed fire shelter. <image:0>

The claim '<image:46> This image shows tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. Reverse image search and web searches did not yield any results to confirm the image's origin or context. While an NPR article discusses Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, it does not contain the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
