Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, threatening those holding hostages in the Middle East with severe consequences if they are not released before January 20, 2025. The article does not mention any statement by Trump regarding Israel or the assassination attempt. The article was published on July 25, 2024. <image:11568>, <image:11567>, <image:11569>.

The claim 'President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, as a reaction to the attempted assasination of him on July 13, 2024, 'I hope that America obliterates Israel.'' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on July 25, 2024, saying, "I hope that America obliterates Israel," cannot be verified. While it is confirmed that Trump posted on Truth Social on that date and was the target of an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, searches for the specific quote did not yield any results. The available evidence, including a report from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-warns-there-will-be-all-hell-to-pay-if-hostages-arent-released-by-jan-20/)), does not support the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
