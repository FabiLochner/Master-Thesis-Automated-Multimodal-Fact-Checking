## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)) reports that the International Judo Federation will investigate why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul ![image 2326](media/2025-07-20_11-09-1753009784-510523.jpg). The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)) also reports on the investigation, noting that an Algerian newspaper praised the judoka for avoiding the match <image:i>.

The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)) also reports on the investigation, stating that Dris missed weight, preventing the match ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The article mentions that Butbul has had walkover victories in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Algerian judo athlete, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against the Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, because he failed to make weight. The International Judo Federation is investigating the circumstances. While the claim is supported by the evidence, it is more accurate to state that the athlete was prevented from competing due to failing to make weight, rather than withdrawing.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the Algerian judoka did not compete against the Israeli opponent. However, the reason was failing to make weight, not a voluntary withdrawal.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is inaccurate. While the Algerian judoka, Messaoud Redouane Dris, did not compete against the Israeli opponent, Tohar Butbul, the reason was that Dris failed to make weight, as reported by ESPN ([https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match](https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40680600/judo-org-probe-failed-weigh-match)), The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/29/algerian-judoka-investigated-after-failing-to-make-weight-for-bout-with-israeli)), and The Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75](https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-israel-algeria-5925a924c57c1d6440b2cbf09d57cb75)).
