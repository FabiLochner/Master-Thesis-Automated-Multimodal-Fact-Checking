*   Over 40 airlines have canceled flights in and out of Israel amid the ongoing war.

 during which at least 687 Palestinians have been killed and 3,800 more have been injured, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The ongoing war has thrown Israel's travel industry into chaos
--------------------------------------------------------------

More than [40 airlines have canceled flights to and from the country](https://www.businessinsider.com/airlines-canceling-flights-to-israel-tel-aviv-2023-10)
.

"People are just scared and trying to get out," Lia Hershkovitz, who flew out of Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, told Insider.

Muki Portnoy, her husband, and three children were supposed to fly home to New Jersey on a United flight that was canceled. Their travel agent booked them another flight on Monday to Madrid via the Spanish carrier Iberia. On the shuttle ride to the airport after dropping off their rental car, Portnoy got a notification that their flight had been canceled, she said.

"When we arrived, the airport was just completely mobbed. Lines were out the door, almost," she said.

Portnoy and her husband looked for alternative flights. She said they were repeatedly waved away by airport workers, and that Israel's El Al airline wasn't letting anyone stand in line at the ticket counter unless they already had a reservation. (Insider has contacted the airline for comment.) She said their travel agent waitlisted their party of five on 40 different El Al flights, but none of them had available seats. 

She described the scene as "hundreds and hundreds of frustrated people. People crying. Lots and lots and lots of families just sitting on the floor, waiting around. Lots of long lines everywhere. People confused, not really sure where to go and what to do."

Portnoy's husband returned to the airport the following day, waiting in line for five hours until he secured tickets for a flight on Wednesday.

It took Hannah Zucherman three tries to book a flight out of Israel in her efforts to get home to San Francisco. She said the airline of the second flight she booked, on Turkish Airlines, didn't even notify her that it had been canceled. Instead, she says she found out by looking it up on Ben Gurion's website. Insider has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment.

When she did successfully buy a ticket and make it through security, she found the waiting areas eerily silent.

"Inside the terminal it was very quiet and folks were clearly on edge," Zucherman said. "Normally, there are kids running around and lots of noise. This time it was much more subdued."

Israelis trying to return home are also facing challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

Jerusalem resident Daniel Rosehill's El Al flight from Barcelona to Israel on Monday was delayed for a few hours, but he eventually made it to Israel.

"The cabin crew made a sort of somber announcement about these being difficult times and El Al being committed to bringing Israelis home," he told Insider. 

Rosehill said the arrivals terminal was "noticeably more quiet than usual, but otherwise business as normal." When he stepped off the plane, he noted signs indicating the nearest shelter from incoming rocket fire.

The Israel Airports Authority has not responded to Insider's request for comment.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

    ! His remarks followed a meeting with top military and intelligence officials to assess the strike.

The military identified the drone as an Iranian Samad-3, upgraded to travel long distances, and said it was believed to have come from Yemen.

The [Houthis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/houthi)
 claimed responsibility, saying their “UAV \[unmanned aerial vehicle\] force” attacked “one of the important targets in the occupied Jaffa region, what is now called Israeli Tel Aviv”.

Earlier this month, Israeli forces said they had detected a suspected Houthi drone headed for the Red Sea port of Eilat, which they shot down with a fighter jet.

The Iran-backed group has launched waves of attacks targeting shipping through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, causing significant disruption and a sharp drop in business at the port of Eilat.

The Houthis have said they launched the attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza, which have so far killed more than 38,000 people since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel.

The drone attack shook residents of Tel Aviv, undermining a fragile sense of security as Israelis living close to the border with Lebanon increasingly fear incursions by drones or rockets sent by Hezbollah, while communities close to the border with Gaza remain on high alert for sporadic rocket fire.

Footage from the site in Tel Aviv showed broken glass strewn across the pavements as crowds of onlookers gathered near a building bearing blast marks. <image:2528>

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) building, an attack that analysts assessed had possibly been an attempt by the Houthis to strike anywhere they could in Tel Aviv. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militia that has been attacking ships in the Red Sea, claimed responsibility for the strike on the city of 450,000 people.

The Israeli military’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. No air-raid sirens warned residents before the drone crashed into the building, causing an explosion that jolted people from their sleep, shattered windows and left shrapnel scattered on the streets.

“We are investigating why we did not identify it, attack it and intercept it,” Admiral Hagari said on Friday.

Another Israeli military official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said there was a possibility that human error had allowed the drone to penetrate Israeli airspace.

Israeli officials did not announce an immediate military response against the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen. The group has attempted several attacks on southern Israel, but this one managed to reach farther into the country."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.

  !A workmen measures a door in a building damaged by an explosion in Tel Aviv, Israel on July 19. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack, marking the first time the group has penetrated a major Israeli city.

The drone set off a loud blast that woke Tel Aviv residents just after 3 a.m. The official described it as "human error." The official described the drone as large and capable of long-distance flight.

Given the location of the attack, the drone may have approached Israel from the Mediterranean Sea, but Israeli officials did not immediately comment on the route it took.

The Houthis, the most powerful group in Yemen, claimed responsibility and said this was a new type of drone "capable of bypassing the enemy's interception systems and undetectable by radars. The operation has achieved its goals successfully."

The group warned of more such attacks.

The Israeli military official said the initial evidence suggested the drone was launched from Yemen, but Israel was investigating a range of possibilities.

The Houthis have been firing for months on commercial ships in the Red Sea, off Yemen's western coast. Houthis claim responsibility** **The deadly drone slammed into an apartment building on the Tel Aviv oceanfront just after 3 a.m. The Houthi militia in Yemen said it carried out the attack as part of its support for Palestinians.**

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.

Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government “cannot give security to the citizens of Israel.”

“There are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,” he said.

Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are “precisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel’s policy.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country’s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join.

Houthi attacks
--------------

The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country’s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel’s defenses.

The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped.

Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday.

The attack was claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel’s war in Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Deadly explosion
----------------

The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities.

There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission and no reports of injuries of US personnel or “locally engaged staff,” the US State Department said.

“We are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,” the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens.

Emergency crews responded to “an object” that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said.

“The dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,” MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. The bulk carrier sank days after an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels believed to have killed one mariner on board, authorities said early Wednesday,  June 19, the second-such ship to be sunk in the rebel campaign. The bulk carrier sank days after an attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels believed to have killed one mariner on board, authorities said early Wednesday, June 19, the second-such ship to be sunk in the rebel campaign. The attack “gives momentum” to these rallies, he said.

The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq.

The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis.

In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.

A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders.

An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to “human error.” It was armed with a warhead and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device’s payload.

The official didn’t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel’s aerial defense systems don’t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile.

According to an initial inquiry “no sirens were activated” during the incident, the IDF said earlier.

Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was “shocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack” and sent his condolences to the victims’ families. The war has displaced almost all of the strip’s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis.

 killed an Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv and injured several others.

The Israeli military confirmed the attack, saying in a statement that it came "in response to the hundreds of attacks carried out against the State of Israel in recent months." Friday's drone attack in Tel Aviv was one of the rare instances where a drone has reached Israeli airspace. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Israel strikes Houthi targets in Yemen one day after Tel Aviv drone attack
==========================================================================

The Israeli military confirmed that it had carried out airstrikes against Houthi-linked targets in Yemen, saying it was in retaliation for some 200 drone and cruise missile attacks towards Israel from Yemen since Oct. Haaretz reported that the Israeli attack against the Houthis was approved at a special security cabinet meeting which convened earlier in the day. 

Saudi news outlet Al Hadath reported on Saturday that at least three people were killed and 15 injured in the Israeli attack, and that complexes belonging to economic institutions and the military police were targeted. 

In a post on X, Houthi spokesman Nasruddin Amer vowed that the group would continue its attacks. ](/sites/default/files/styles/article_hero_medium/public/2024-07/GS8MZiCWUAAo7FT.jpeg?h=a5ae579a&itok=xKPvE-YM)

A handout picture obtained from Yemen's Houthi Ansarullah Media Center show a huge column of fire erupting following reported strikes in the Yemeni rebel-held port city of Hodeida on July 20, 2024. The Iran-backed group has been firing missiles and drones toward Israel since the war in Gaza began last October, yet Israeli and US forces have shot down the vast majority of these.

Unnamed senior American officials told The New York Times that Israel acted on its own, and that the United States did not participate in the attack. "Yemen's position with Gaza is firm and will not change, and the Yemeni operations supporting Gaza will not stop," he wrote.

According to the Israeli military, the Houthis have launched more than 200 drones and cruise missiles at Israel since the Oct. 19](/originals/2023/10/day-13-hamas-israel-war-blog-thursday-oct-19)

## Claim
Claim: "<image:60> This image shows Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack on July 19, 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:60>)
web_search("Houthis attack airport July 19 2024")
geolocate(<image:60>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image <image:60>

### Evidence from `web_search`
On July 19, 2024, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. The attack resulted in one death and several injuries. The attack occurred hours after the Israeli military confirmed the killing of a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

The attack shook residents of Tel Aviv. The Houthis have launched attacks in response to Israeli attacks on Gaza. (<image:2525>, <image:2528>)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.89, 'Palestine': 0.06, 'Jordan': 0.01, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the Houthis claimed responsibility for a drone attack on Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 19, 2024. The attack resulted in casualties and caused distress among residents. The image shows a crowd of people in what appears to be an airport.

The geolocation of the image suggests it was taken in Israel. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts Israelis fleeing the airport after the Houthis attack.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified without additional information linking the image to the specific event.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include information about a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv, Israel. One source discusses a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport, which caused a temporary suspension of flights ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Houthi_attack_on_Tel_Aviv_airport)). Another source, from NPR, reports on a drone attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024, which resulted in one death and includes images of the damage (<image:11869>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv on July 19, 2024. The search results also mention a 2025 attack on Tel Aviv airport.

However, the provided evidence does not explicitly link the image to the July 19, 2024, attack or the 2025 attack. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.
