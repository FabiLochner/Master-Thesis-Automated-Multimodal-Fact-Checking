### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 5, 2024, earthquakes occurred in both Iran and Israel, sparking speculation about nuclear tests. An article from NDTV, published on October 7, 2024, discussed these events. Another article from alphadefense.in, also published on October 7, 2024, focused on the seismic event in Iran's Semnan province, which led to social media discussions about whether it was an earthquake or a nuclear test. The Johns Hopkins University published an article on February 4, 2025, discussing misinformation linking the Iranian earthquake to a seismic event in Israel on the same evening. <image:k>
