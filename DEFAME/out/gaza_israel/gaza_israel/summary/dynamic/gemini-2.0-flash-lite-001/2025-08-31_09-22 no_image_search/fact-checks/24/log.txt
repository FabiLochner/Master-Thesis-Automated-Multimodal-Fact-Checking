Useful result: From [Source](https://www.cfi.org.uk/news.php?article=811): 
Content: The CFI UK news article discusses the controversy surrounding UNRWA's support for Hamas. Some claimed that UNRWA's modified logo with a black stripe was linked to the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. However, UNRWA stated that the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20. Other sources confirmed this using archiving tools. The article was amended on October 22, 2024.

The claim '<image:18> This image shows a screenshot of the X profile of UNRWA which has placed a black band over its profile photo in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The black ribbon on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the image, was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and has been present since at least October 22, 2023, according to a DW.COM fact-check ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
