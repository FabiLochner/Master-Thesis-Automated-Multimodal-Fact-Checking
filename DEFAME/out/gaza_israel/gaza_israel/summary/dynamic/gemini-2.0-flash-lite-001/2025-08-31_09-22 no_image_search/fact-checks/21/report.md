## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Donald Trump ordered a halt to UNRWA funding. Politico reports that an executive order to stop UNRWA funding was expected to be issued on February 3, 2025 ([https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100)), and The Hindu reports that the order was issued on February 4, 2025. The Brookings Institution article from 2018 discusses Trump's decision to eliminate US funding for UNRWA ([https://www.brookings.edu/articles/in-one-move-trump-eliminated-us-funding-for-unrwa-and-the-us-role-as-mideast-peacemaker/](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/in-one-move-trump-eliminated-us-funding-for-unrwa-and-the-us-role-as-mideast-peacemaker/)).

The claim states that the executive order was signed on January 20, 2025. However, the provided evidence indicates that the order was expected to be issued on February 3, 2025, and was issued on February 4, 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The claim that Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA is not accurate. The evidence indicates that the order was expected to be issued on February 3, 2025, and was issued on February 4, 2025.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is inaccurate. While Donald Trump did halt UNRWA funding, the evidence indicates the executive order was expected on February 3, 2025, and issued on February 4, 2025, not January 20, 2025, as stated in the claim, as reported by [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/us-withdraw-un-human-rights-council-trump-00202100) and The Hindu.
