FRANCE 24 ([https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20250403-syria-nine-killed-israel-bombardment-attack-daraa)) reported on ground incursions in Tasil, with the IDF seizing weapons and destroying infrastructure. The Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php)) mentions an IDF incursion in response to fire from gunmen.

The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/2025-04-03/live-updates-848643](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/2025-04-03/live-updates-848643)) also reported on IDF strikes and clashes near Daraa. The image ![image 42](media/69.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image depicts Israeli military forces. The reverse image search confirms the image's existence. The geolocation data indicates a high probability of the image being taken in Palestine or Israel. Web searches confirm Israeli military activity in the Daraa region, including the town of Tasil.

The web search results mention IDF incursions and clashes in the Daraa region, including Tasil, which aligns with the claim. However, the provided sources do not explicitly confirm that the image shows Israeli military forces entering Tasil on foot in February 2025.

Therefore, while the evidence supports the presence of Israeli military forces in the area, the exact context of the image, including the date and specific location within Tasil, remains unverified. More information is needed to confirm the claim's specifics.
