## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)) reported that FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, invited Israeli embassy representatives to a soccer match on February 16, 2023, and includes a photograph of the event (![image 52](media/83.jpg)). The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/barcelona-ends-friendship-agreement-with-tel-aviv-over-gaza-war/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/barcelona-ends-friendship-agreement-with-tel-aviv-over-gaza-war/)) reported in May 2024 that Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government, citing the ongoing war in Gaza, which started on October 7, 2023.

TRT Global ([https://trt.global/world/article/67eb8f92839b](https://trt.global/world/article/67eb8f92839b)) reported on August 27, 2025, that Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni announced that Gaza and other Palestinian cities will symbolically become Barcelonaâ€™s 11th district.


## Elaboration
The image shows FC Barcelona's president with Israeli embassy representatives. The Jerusalem Post reported that this event occurred on February 16, 2023. The claim states the event happened in September 2024, which is incorrect. The Gaza war started on October 7, 2023.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts an event that occurred in February 2023, not September 2024, as the claim states. The claim also mentions the ongoing Gaza war, which started in October 2023, but the event predates this conflict. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date of the event.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image shows FC Barcelona's president with Israeli embassy representatives, an event that took place on February 16, 2023, as reported by The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893)). The claim incorrectly states the event occurred in September 2024, after the start of the Gaza war in October 2023.
