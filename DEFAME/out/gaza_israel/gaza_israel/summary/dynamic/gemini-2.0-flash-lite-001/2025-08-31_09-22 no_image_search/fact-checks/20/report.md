## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating the White House offered no evidence. The State Department would not repeat the claim. The Washington Post ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/)) reported that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza.

Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148)) reports that Elon Musk backtracked on the claim. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants database shows that the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Mozambique received more than $83 million in funding since 2021 for reproductive health projects in two provinces: Inhambane and Gaza.


## Elaboration
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. The Washington Post reported that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. However, CNN stated that the White House offered no evidence to support the claim. Furthermore, Elon Musk retracted the claim.

The Anadolu Agency article mentions that the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation received funding for reproductive health projects in Gaza, but it does not specify that the funding was for condoms.

More information is needed to verify the claim definitively, such as the specific details of the funding and the source of the information used by DOGE and OMB.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/is-the-us-sending-50m-in-condoms-to-gaza-as-trump-claims)) reports that Karoline Leavitt stated that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. The article also mentions that Trump made the claim, but provided no evidence. The International Medical Corps (IMC) stated that no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms, nor provide family-planning services. USAID reports show no record of condoms shipped to Gaza.

The Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/no-us-funding-used-for-condoms-or-family-planning-in-gaza-aid-group/3466324)) reports that the IMC refuted claims that US government funding was used for condoms or family planning services in Gaza. The White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt claimed that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer dollars were going to fund condoms in Gaza, but did not provide evidence. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim's veracity is undermined by the new evidence. While Karoline Leavitt stated that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, she provided no evidence. Furthermore, the International Medical Corps (IMC) refuted claims that US government funding was used for condoms or family planning services in Gaza. USAID reports show no record of condoms shipped to Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates conflicting information. While some sources claim that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million was allocated for condoms in Gaza, other sources, including the International Medical Corps and USAID, deny this. The lack of concrete evidence supporting the claim, coupled with the denials from relevant organizations, makes it difficult to verify the claim's accuracy.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is **false**. While the White House and DOGE/OMB initially made the claim, they provided no evidence. Furthermore, the International Medical Corps and USAID denied that US funding was used for condoms or family planning services in Gaza.
