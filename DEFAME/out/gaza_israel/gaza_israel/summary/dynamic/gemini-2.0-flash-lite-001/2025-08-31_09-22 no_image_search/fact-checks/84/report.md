```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (![image 53](media/84.jpg)) is of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house. According to PesaCheck, the image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The article is from PesaCheck and was published on August 28, 2024.

The Times of Israel published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea. The image is also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow".

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. However, the image dates back to 2019, according to PesaCheck. The claim states that the image was taken in August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it was taken in 2019, not in August 2024 as the claim states. The claim also states that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone, which is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts Benjamin Netanyahu's house, but it was taken in 2019, as evidenced by a PesaCheck article ([MISSING CONTEXT: This image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ...](https://pesacheck.org/missing-context-this-image-of-israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahus-home-was-not-captured-by-9d48e97d86b7)), contradicting the claim that it was taken in August 2024. The claim also incorrectly attributes the image to a Hezbollah drone.
