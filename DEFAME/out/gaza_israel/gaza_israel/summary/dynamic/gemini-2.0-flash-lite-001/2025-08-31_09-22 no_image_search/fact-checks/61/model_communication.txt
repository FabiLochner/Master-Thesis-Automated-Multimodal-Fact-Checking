*   Mocking posts by Israeli soldiers going viral
*   Some experts say posts may breach international law

March 28 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 as a looming [famine](/world/middle-east/destruction-lawlessness-red-tape-hobble-aid-gazans-go-hungry-2024-03-25/)
 intensifies world scrutiny of Israel's offensive.

In one video, an Israeli soldier sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa.

Elsewhere, another soldier sits atop a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet and says: "I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman."

The two videos shot by Israeli soldiers are among dozens of posts in which troops in Gaza are shown displaying lingerie, mannequins, and in some cases both. Human Rights Office spokesperson.

Reuters sent details of the eight verified posts on YouTube or Instagram to the Israel Defense Forces, requesting comment.

In response, a spokesperson sent a statement saying the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers, as well as reports of videos uploaded to social networks.

"In cases where suspicion of a criminal offense arises that justifies opening an investigation, an investigation is opened by the Military Police," it said.

"It should be clarified that in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the video is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly," the statement said.

The IDF declined to say whether it was referring to any of the images highlighted by Reuters, or whether any of the soldiers responsible have been disciplined.

The Israeli soldiers whom Reuters was able to identify did not respond to requests for comment sent via their social media accounts.

The experts also said there was convincing information that some Israeli hostages taken to Gaza had been subjected to sexual violence which may still be ongoing.

MANNEQUINS AND UNDERWEAR
------------------------

The authenticated posts include a photo of a soldier holding a bare female mannequin from behind with his hands on its breasts and one of a soldier handling a half-naked doll.

One photo shows a soldier posing with his gun, making a thumbs-up gesture, in front of a double bed strewn with packets of women's underwear.

YouTube said it had removed a video flagged by Reuters for violating the platform's harassment policies, which prohibit content that reveals someone's personally identifiable information. Instagram did not comment.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza was launched in response to an attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Oct. Still, two legal experts said they potentially breached international law.

Ardi Imseis, an assistant professor of law at Queen's University in Canada, said the posts violated article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs the treatment of civilians in wartime.

Article 27 says civilians are entitled to respect for their honour, family rights, manners and customs, and must be protected against insults and public curiosity, and that women must be especially protected against any attack on their honour.

Within Israel, the lingerie posts have attracted little attention, said Oren Persico of the Seventh Eye, a website covering Israeli media."

With two-thirds of Gaza's population living in poverty even before the war, many people were forced to sell their clothes once the conflict broke out and tanked the economy further.

For months, Safaa Yassin has dressed her child in the same white bodysuit, an all-too-familiar tale in the Gaza Strip, which has been devastated by 10 months of war.

"When I was pregnant, I dreamed of dressing my daughter in beautiful clothes. Today, I have nothing to put on her," says Yassin, one of thousands of Palestinians displaced from Gaza City.

"I never thought that one day I wouldn't be able to dress my children," says the 38-year-old, now living in Al-Mawasi, a coastal area designated as a humanitarian zone by Israeli forces.

"But the few clothes I found before evacuating to the south were either the wrong size or not suitable for the season," she adds, as Gaza bakes in summertime temperatures of 30-plus degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) every day.

Finding clothing -- any clothing -- has become increasingly difficult for the 2.4 million people living in the territory besieged by Israel.

Gaza once had a thriving textiles industry but since the war began on October 7 with Palestinian militant group Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel, it has received just a trickle of goods.

Faten Juda also struggles to dress her 15-month-old son, Adam, who is squeezed into ill-fitting pyjamas, his bare arms and legs sticking out from the tight fabric.

"He's growing every day and his clothes don't fit him anymore, but I can't find any others," the 30-year-old tells AFP.

Same headscarf

Children are not the only ones suffering from the lack of clothing in the Gaza Strip, which counted 900 textile factories in the industry's heyday in the early 1990s.

The sector employed 35,000 people and sent four million items to Israel every month. But those numbers have plummeted since 2007, when Hamas took power and Israel blockaded Gaza.

Blinken returns to Israel in Gaza truce push as Hamas rejects US 'diktats'](https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2024/Aug/18/blinken-returns-to-israel-in-gaza-truce-push-as-hamas-rejects-us-diktats)

In recent years, Gaza's workshops had dwindled to about 100, employing about 4,000 people and shipping about 30,000-40,000 items a month to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

By January, three months into the war, the World Bank estimated that 79 percent of Gaza's private sector establishments had been partially or totally destroyed.

Even the factories that are still standing have ground to a halt, after months without electricity in Gaza. I've had them repaired at least 30 times, each time paying 10 times more than before the war," he says, his gaunt face burnt by the sun.

Walking barefoot

With two-thirds of Gaza's population living in poverty even before the war, many people were forced to sell their clothes once the conflict broke out and tanked the economy further.

But "there are no more shoes or clothes to sell", says Omar Abu Hashem, 25, who was displaced from Rafah, on the Egyptian border, to Khan Yunis further north.

Abu Hashem left his home in such a rush that he was unable to take anything with him. With limited water to wash them, disease-spreading lice abound.

Ahmed al-Masri, 29, left his home in the north of Gaza at the start of the war.

Today in Khan Yunis, in the south, he says he does not have any spare shoes or clothes.

"My shoes are extremely damaged. I quickly wash my T-shirt and then I wait for it to dry," he says.

"And all this, without soap or detergent."

In these conditions, finding new clothes is a rare event.

"Some women have been wearing the same headscarf for the past 10 months," Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees, posted on X.

Wearing the same clothes all the time is not just unpleasant, it is a health hazard. He has been wearing the same pair of shoes for five months, but only every other day.

"I share my pair of shoes with my brother-in-law," he explains.

On the days when he goes barefoot, he fears the worst, tiptoeing around the waste and rubble that carry diseases and contamination of all kinds.

Ahmed al-Masri, meanwhile, just wants some soap to wash his only T-shirt and pair of trousers.

"I have been wearing the same clothes for nine months."

The photo shows a large crowd of more than 200 people, crouching low amid the rubble of [Jabalya in northern Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/middleeast/israeli-incursion-northern-gaza-stray-dogs-eating-bodies-intl/index.html)
. The men at the front are anxiously staring straight ahead, while those toward the back stretch their necks to see what is going on.

The photo, taken in Jabalya on Friday, shows residents of the refugee camp who tried to leave the area after being forced by the Israeli military to evacuate amid its ongoing ground operation there.

The photo was first shared on an Israeli Telegram channel; while it is unclear who took it, several of the men in the picture told CNN Israeli soldiers were photographing them as they were being detained.

CNN has identified and spoken to five individuals seen in the photograph. They were insulting us during that time, calling us names, laughing and taking pictures,” the 27-year old told CNN.

According to Khalaf, the men in the crowd seen in the photograph were asked to come forward five at a time, to be screened by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) before being allowed to proceed to Gaza City, which has been designated by the Israeli military as a safe place.

Repeated strip-searches in Gaza
-------------------------------

The IDF [encircled Jabalya](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/16/middleeast/israeli-incursion-northern-gaza-stray-dogs-eating-bodies-intl/index.html)
 and launched a new ground operation there more than three weeks ago, cutting off most supplies and forcing people to leave amid heavy fighting. The IDF said it saw signs of Hamas rebuilding in the area, despite a year of heavy bombardment and two previous ground operations which the IDF had claimed were successful.

In recent weeks, the Israeli military has issued repeated evacuation orders for Northern Gaza, including dropping flyers over Jabalya warning residents to “evacuate immediately.” Several Palestinians previously [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/middleeast/gaza-jabalya-idf-shooting-intl/index.html)
 that they had been shot at as they tried to follow the evacuation orders.

While the Israeli military refused to comment on the situation captured in the photograph, it admitted it has been routinely detaining and strip-searching people as part of its combat operations in Gaza."

Wash in cold water (preferably below 30°C or 86°F) to maintain fabric integrity and prevent shrinkage.

**Detergent Choice:**

Choose a gentle, pH-neutral detergent to maintain fabric elasticity and colors.

Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners as they can damage the fibers and affect moisture-wicking properties.

**Drying:**

Air drying is the best option to retain fabric quality and prevent heat damage.

Lay flat or hang your activewear in a shaded area away from direct sunlight.

Avoid tumble drying, as the heat can negatively impact elasticity and shape.

**Ironing and Steaming:**

If necessary, iron or steam your activewear at a low temperature."

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(<image:36>)
geolocate(<image:36>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.29, 'Tunisia': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.19, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.07, 'Pakistan': 0.04, 'China': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine. The claim states the image was taken in Gaza, which is part of Palestine. The evidence does not provide information about the tank being Israeli or the date of the image.

Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Actions
```
web_search("Israeli tank drying clothes Gaza")
web_search("tank drying clothes Palestine")
```

The image depicts a tank with clothes hanging on it, and the claim states it's an Israeli tank used by a Palestinian woman to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024. While the evidence suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine, there is no information to confirm the tank's origin, the woman's identity, or the date. The search results do not provide any information about the image.

Photographs of a young Palestinian child appearing to suffer from severe malnutrition have emerged over the past week as a new symbol of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, where the war between Israel and the Palestinian [Hamas](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/hamas)
 movement is grinding on amid repeated failed ceasefire initiatives.

But the images have also set off a firestorm of controversy, with a number of sources arguing that one-and-a-half-year-old —photographed being cradled by his mother, Hidaya—also suffered from underlying conditions contributing to his emaciated state, and that his "[non-emaciated](https://x.com/KyleWOrton/status/1949826769382457540)
" brother was cropped out of the photos.

While few deny that Palestinians in Gaza are faced with dire and deteriorating living conditions, the debate is playing out as Israeli officials and supporters of Israel's war aims contend that reports of mass hunger in the besieged territory are exaggerated and deliberately engineered to fit a narrative backed by Hamas.

!Mohammad, al-Matouq, in, Gaza <image:4304>

Hidaya, a 31-year-old Palestinian mother, carries her sick 18-month-old son Mohammed al-Matouq, who is also displaying signs of malnutrition, inside their tent at the Al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, on July 24, 2025. OMAR AL-QATTAA/AFP/Getty Images

"There is no starvation in Gaza, no policy of starvation in Gaza, and I assure you that we have a commitment to achieve our war goals," Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/benjamin-netanyahu)
 declared on Sunday.

But as the [United Nations](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/united-nations)
 and international humanitarian organizations argue otherwise, one of the Israeli premier's closest allies, President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump)
 also cast doubt on Netanyahu's claim when asked by a reporter if he agreed with it.

"I don't know. They were quickly featured on a number of international outlets, including [BBC](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/bbc)
, [CNN](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn)
, _The Guardian_, [NBC](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nbc)
 News, _The New York Times_ and _The Washington Post_.

Most coverage included Matouq's image to reinforce reporting about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with many including additional visuals and sources, such as local and international aid workers. Yet the majority of the articles did not reference that Matouq also suffered from other ailments, as alleged by investigative journalist David Collier, who is supportive of Israel's war efforts.

In a series of X posts, Collier accused mainstream media outlets on Sunday of manipulating Matouq's plight without highlighting that he had cerebral palsy, hypoxia and a "serious genetic disorder," citing what he said was a May 2025 medical report issued in Gaza.

"You exploited the image of a child with cerebral palsy to push a lie about famine," Collier wrote in a follow-up post Monday directed toward several major outlets who featured Matouq's image. "He needs specialised formula and medication."

!gaza photo hunger <image:4305>

Photographs of Mohammed al-Matouq were printed on the front pages of newspapers around the world. "He is not simply a victim of starvation, and the image has been presented in a misleading and incomplete way."

Getty Images, which hosts several photos of Matouq and his mother taken by a photographer from the Turkish news agency Anadolu, described the child as "sick" and "also displaying signs of malnutrition" in accompanying captions.

A _Newsweek_ search of Getty's database found [numerous](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rahil-mohammed-rasras-a-32-year-old-palestinian-woman-news-photo/2225467851?adppopup=true)

 of other Palestinians, both children and adults, also displaying signs of malnutrition in recent imagery taken from Gaza.

She testified that colleagues in Gaza had spoken with mothers "who are watching their babies waste away in front of them, and medics who are despairing about their inability to save them." She said UNICEF has also conducted interviews with children "who were injured in the desperate search for food, or watched a parent be killed in front of them while trying to get a little bit of aid."

"This crisis is manmade and entirely preventable," Ingram said."

    The Irish father and sister of eight-year-old Emily Hand, who is believed to be held hostage since she was taken by Hamas on 7 October, tell a Dublin news conference of their distress at her disappearance.
    
    Thomas Hand, originally from Dun Laoghaire, travelled to Dublin with Natalie "to drum up as much sympathy and support" for hostages taken to Gaza.
    
    He describes his daughter Emily as a "fun-loving child", adding that “even my dog misses her”.
    
    “And now she's kidnapped in Gaza along with many others,” he adds.
    
    Emily’s sister Natali was in Australia when Hamas attacked southern Israel. Summary

The Viral Atrocities Posted by Israeli Soldiers
===============================================

Tracing 75 years of Israeli war photography, an anthropologist explains how images that reframe disproportionate violence as proof of victory have intensified in the war on Gaza that erupted in 2023.

By [Sophia Goodfriend](https://www.sapiens.org/authors/sophia-goodfriend/)

20 Mar 2024

!A header image on a cellphone of several people wearing military uniforms and holding hands is above a yellow logo and white text that reads, “Israel Defense Forces.” White text underneath reads, “Official IDF Twitter account. We tweet real-time information and updates in 7 languages—choose yours.” <image:4410>

> _Content Warning: The materials below include images of violence._

✽

In early January, a [TikTok account](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/zAdvXhtCIik)
 affiliated with Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas party posted a video that an Israeli soldier filmed in Gaza. The scenes narrated the atrocities of 1948, [in the words of Azoulay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670045)
, “as a series of unproblematic, quasi-natural events and justified as side effects of the state-building project.”

Anthropologist [Rebecca Stein](https://rebeccalstein.com/)
 notes in the _International Journal of Middle East Studies_ that [similar images](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40206012)
 circulated immediately after the 1967 Six-Day war, when Israeli troops occupied the West Bank, annexing East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, among other regions. Staged after the blood had been cleared and the bodies carted off, the images, Stein writes, “served to stabilize and banalize” the military operations they represented.

Soldiers deployed into the heart of the Gaza Strip since last October are updating this historical archive. Others report that algorithmically determined news feeds have prevented many Israelis from seeing images of Palestinian suffering.

But to say, “If only Israelis could see what is happening in Gaza, they would demand an end to the violence” ignores the political reality and majority. But the sentiment may be more popular than ever: According to a survey by the Jerusalem-based think tank the Israel Democracy Institute, as of December 2023, [75 percent of Jewish Israelis](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-01-02/ty-article/75-of-jewish-israelis-reject-u-s-demand-to-shift-gaza-war-to-new-phase-poll-finds/0000018c-caa4-d4e1-ad8f-feb5bdda0000)
 opposed agreeing to the U.S. Her public writing on automated warfare and digital rights in the region can be found in _Foreign Policy_, _The Baffler_, _Jewish Currents_, _+972 Magazine_, and the _London Review of Books_, among other outlets.

Methodology
===========

This report is based on interviews with 66 Palestinians from Gaza, as well as 4 individuals working with Gaza’s Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU), 31 health care professionals, and 15 individuals working with UN agencies and international aid organizations in Gaza. It’s a water well,” the employee added.[\[301\]](#_ftn301)

Another CMWU employee stated that on December 26, 2023, an Israeli warplane attacked and killed one of his colleagues, a water engineer working with the CMWU, and his two children, while they were driving from Khan Younis to Rafah to pick up water tanks from the UNICEF warehouse at the border.[\[302\]](#_ftn302)
 He stated that people in the car next to the CMWU employees witnessed the attack and reported to the CMWU that they had seen the warplane overhead and the munition that destroyed the car, killing the three civilians.[\[303\]](#_ftn303)

The employee explained that all of the vehicles belonging to the CMWU, including the one that was struck in the attack, have “water” written on top of the vehicle, along with a code that has been shared with Israeli authorities and the ICRC, that are clearly visible from above.[\[304\]](#_ftn304)
 “He was also driving in a green area,” he added, referring to the routes designated as “safe” by Israeli authorities.[\[305\]](#_ftn305)

The placement of Israeli forces near and around water infrastructure has prevented supplies and maintenance crews from reaching water sources and infrastructure because of the risks associated with getting close to the forces, according to employees of the CMWU as well as two employees of international organizations working on WASH.[\[306\]](#_ftn306)
 National Public Radio (NPR), a US-based non-profit media organization, reported that satellite imagery showed Israeli forces had occupied and stationed military vehicles close to Gaza City’s desalination plant and its sewage treatment plant by early November.[\[307\]](#_ftn307)
 Satellite imagery from November 24, 2023, that Human Rights Watch reviewed shows numerous military vehicles stationed in military positions around the Gaza City desalination plant.

An employee of the CMWU told Human Rights Watch, “We are in contact with our people in the north of Gaza, but as… the whole area \[is\] under war conditions and targeting, it is not safe to tour around and assess the damage there.”[\[308\]](#_ftn308)

On June 21, 2024, the CMWU reported that an Israeli airstrike killed five municipal water workers while they were in a garage owned by the municipality to gather fuel to bring to water wells in the area.[\[309\]](#_ftn309)
 A CMWU employee told Human Rights Watch that a single airstrike struck the garage at about 10:40 a.m., and that one civilian outside of the building was also killed by shrapnel from the attack.[\[310\]](#_ftn310)

He added that the CMWU had been coordinating the fuel entry and their movements to bring fuel to wells with the Israeli military via the Palestinian Water Authority in Ramallah: “The workers had been performing this task for weeks without any warning from the IDF to stop this work.”[\[311\]](#_ftn311)
 In a statement, the Municipality of Gaza said that the workers “were performing their national duty and serving citizens despite extremely limited resources and high risks.”[\[312\]](#_ftn312)

  
 

V. Al Jazeera reported that in Khan Younis, an Israeli sniper shot and killed a girl trying to collect water from Nasser hospital on February 7, 2024.[\[347\]](#_ftn347)
 At the time, Nasser hospital was under siege by Israeli forces, and the area around the hospital was surrounded by Israeli tanks.[\[348\]](#_ftn348)
 OCHA reported that on February 7 in Gaza City, at least 13 people were killed while trying to get water from a truck that was struck.[\[349\]](#_ftn349)

On the morning of February 29, Israeli forces reportedly fired artillery shells and gunshots on an aid convoy where Palestinians were gathered to receive food aid on al-Rashid road south of Gaza City.[\[350\]](#_ftn350)
 The Gaza Ministry of Health reported 112 Palestinians killed and 760 others injured during the attack.[\[351\]](#_ftn351)
 Following pressure from the international community to investigate the incident,[\[352\]](#_ftn352)
 the Israeli military denied striking the aid convoy and alleged that the majority of Palestinians were killed or injured as “a result of stampede.”[\[353\]](#_ftn353)
 However, a UN team visiting those wounded in the incident in al-Shifa hospital the following day reported seeing “large numbers of gunshot wounds.”[\[354\]](#_ftn354)

Palestinians have also been wounded by attacks on other aid-distribution sites in Gaza. The UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict in 2008-09 found that Israel’s attacks on water and sanitation infrastructure, including on the Sheikh Ejleen wastewater treatment facility (also covered in this report), were “the result of a deliberate and systematic policy … not carried out because those objects presented a military threat or opportunity, but to make the daily process of living, and dignified living, more difficult for the civilian population.”[\[602\]](#_ftn602)
 The UN Fact-Finding Mission found "that the series of acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza Strip of … water … could lead a competent court to find that the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity, has been committed.”[\[603\]](#_ftn603)
 The UN Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict reported Israeli forces’ unjustified destruction of water tanks in Khuza’a, the overall heavy damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, and noted Israel’s “lamentable track record in holding wrongdoers accountable.”[\[604\]](#_ftn604)

In the hostilities in Gaza since October 2023, the Israeli authorities had all the coordinates of public water and sanitation infrastructure and were aware that the Mekorot pipelines that run from Israel to Gaza provide the majority of drinking water available in Gaza.[\[605\]](#_ftn605)
 Thus, they should have had clear knowledge that the actions they have taken since October 7 would lead to starvation from lack of water.

During the current hostilities, Israeli officials have also made their intent clear to deprive the population of objects essential for survival, through a series of statements outlined in the “I. Would you like to read this page in another language?

Summary
=======

Since October 2023, Israeli authorities have deliberately obstructed Palestinians’ access to the adequate amount of water required for survival in the Gaza Strip.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a person needs between 50 and 100 liters of water per day in order to ensure that their “most basic needs are met.”[\[1\]](#_ftn1)
 In protracted emergency situations, the minimum amount of water required is 15 liters of water per person per day for drinking and washing.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)
 Yet, between October 2023 and September 2024, Israeli authorities’ actions have deprived the majority of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza of access to even that bare minimum amount of water, which has contributed to death and widespread disease.[\[3\]](#_ftn3)
 For many in Gaza, much or all of the water they have had access to is not suitable for drinking.

“If we can't find drinkable water, we drink the sea water,” one father displaced to a school in Rafah told Human Rights Watch in December 2023.[\[4\]](#_ftn4)
 “It happened to me many times when I had to drink the sea water. You don’t understand how much we are suffering.”[\[5\]](#_ftn5)

Because of the decimation of the healthcare system in Gaza since October 2023, including disease tracking, the true scale of those harmed or killed by Israeli authorities’ actions that have deprived Palestinians of adequate water is unknown and may likely never be fully understood. Human Rights Watch also spoke to four of Gaza’s Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) employees, 31 doctors and healthcare professionals, and 15 individuals working with UN agencies and international aid organizations in Gaza, who described Israeli forces’ actions that have deprived Palestinians in Gaza of water, as well as the devastating health impacts, including death. Some Israeli strikes have killed water utility workers as they were trying to make repairs, while others have destroyed the main water-utility warehouse in Gaza which housed spare parts, equipment, and supplies critical to water production.[\[11\]](#_ftn11)

On January 26, 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued provisional measures that included requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance, and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide.[\[12\]](#_ftn12)
 The measures were adopted as part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel was violating the Genocide Convention of 1948. At the time, the ICJ determined that “many Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no access to the most basic foodstuffs, potable water, electricity, essential medicines or heating.”[\[13\]](#_ftn13)
 Since then, the ICJ has issued two further provisional measures, reaffirming its prior orders, and stated in May that the orders should be “immediately and effectively implemented.”[\[14\]](#_ftn14)

Since that time, Israel has violated the ICJ’s measures, including preventing “the deprivation of access to adequate food and water.”[\[15\]](#_ftn15)

Water Deprivation as a Deliberate Act
-------------------------------------

In the days after the Hamas-led attacks by Palestinian armed groups in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, senior Israeli officials, including former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and former Energy Minister and current Defense Minister Israel Katz made public statements expressing the government’s aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of water.[\[16\]](#_ftn16)

Since that time, Israeli authorities have continued to call for the collective punishment of the population of Gaza, including through cutting off water and other items essential to life. While Israeli authorities have also made statements calling for measures to be taken to specifically target Hamas and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, authorities’ actions have amounted to cutting off or restricting water and other items essential to life to the whole of the population of Gaza."

Social media accounts posted [a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/DISBVcfsfgU/)
 of two young children appearing as skeletons, claiming that the image shows two children found two months later under the rubble of their home in the Gaza Strip. The caption for the photo reads, “Two children found two months later under the rubble of their home.” Share, don’t just remain silent.

Source of the claim

Kashif verified the image via Google Images search and found it to be old and the claim misleading. The image depicts two Spanish mummified children inside a museum in Bolivia, not two children found under rubble in the Gaza Strip.

The photo was posted on Fliker by an account named [Tanya Knigh on 25/12/2006, and was explained as showing two mummified Spanish children from the 19th century at the Mint Museum in Potosi, Bolivia.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smurfie77/333238377?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaf-NowrYSPdQib6AwuqOgbujlriQwuln3oY-zG75oLRNBKRISpoXJq0vayn1A_aem_WdbZCYRlh2m7hO3aQi4zFQ)

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

La realidad: Una broma por el 1 de abril
----------------------------------------

**Qaani** no está actualmente en **Israel** y al menos por última vez se le vio el pasado viernes en **Teherán** durante las marchas por el llamado **Día de Al Quds**.

> بالصورة.. Esto es totalmente falso.**

Múltiples mensajes en X, en inglés y español e incluso en otros idiomas, se han difundido en X con el siguiente mensaje, palabras más, palabras menos:

_“Tremendo golpe a Iran, se confirma que el comandante de la Fuerza Quds del CGRI de Irán, general Esmail Qaani, se encuentra a salvo en Israel… Ahora se puede revelar que era un activo israelí que proporcionó inteligencia que condujo a la eliminación del líder de Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, y de los líderes de Hezbolá, Nasrallah y Safieddine.. Eli David** (@DrEliDavid), un notorio influencer pro-Israel que cuenta con más de 700 mil seguidores.

El mensaje fue publicado a las 9:46 am (tiempo de **México**) y ha reunido hasta el momento más de 15 mil me gusta, 3 mil retuits y más de 600 mil visualizaciones.

“Última hora: Se confirma que el comandante de la Fuerza Quds del CGRI de Irán, general Esmail Qaani, se encuentra a salvo en Israel. Esmail Qaani is confirmed safe in Israel 🇮🇱
> 
> It can now be revealed that he was an Israeli asset, providing intelligence that led to elimination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and Hezbollah leaders Nasrallah and Safieddine. Eli David (@DrEliDavid) [April 1, 2025](https://twitter.com/DrEliDavid/status/1907097276167884906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Sin verificar la información publicada por @DrEliDavid, múltiples usuarios comenzaron a difundirlo tomándolo por verdad.

Algunos de ellos, despistados, incluso recurrieron a Grok, la inteligencia artificial de X, que por igual les verificó que la información carecía de sustento.

@DrEliDavid no solo no ha aclarado a sus miles de seguidores que es una broma, sino que la continuó.

Horas después del mensaje original, @**DrEliDavid** publicó un mensaje en el que dijo: “Acaba de ser confirmado en la TV israelí por el reportero militar Shak Ran”, haciendo un juego de palabras con la palabra para _mentira_ en hebreo, Shakran.

> Just confirmed on Israeli TV by the military reporter Shak Ran [https://t.co/Vq1eYNC3mT](https://t.co/Vq1eYNC3mT)

La mentira tiene su origen en un rumor que surgió en octubre del año pasado, cuando se le señaló de ser un infiltrado de **Israel** en **Irán** que colaboró en la eliminación de **Hassan Nasrallah**, líder de **Hezbolá**.

El rumor surgió a raíz de que [no se escuchó de él en los días siguientes a la eliminación](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-quds-force-chief-out-contact-since-beirut-strikes-two-iranian-officials-2024-10-06/)

"Killing women and children and destroying the homes of defenseless people is neither a display of skill nor strength; it is a sign of your weakness and helplessness.”

Qa'ani said the blockaded Gaza Strip still stands firm despite an extensive war for a year and a half, noting that such firm resistance “reflects the resolute will of its people.”

**Navy chief: Iran's defense capabilities stronger than ever**

Separately on Thursday, head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy Rear Admiral Shahram Irani described the country's maritime power and defense capabilities as stronger than ever before.

“Today, our enemies view the armed forces of the Navy as a superpower,” he said in Bandar Abbas during a meeting with the families of the personnel of the 86th Naval Group which traveled the world for 236 days between September 2022 and May 2023. 

Irani attributed the success of the mission to a combination of the personnel's expertise and the patience and endurance of the families of the comrades, emphasizing that families play a crucial role in boosting the morale of the personnel during long-term international missions.

Irani said the international community views Iran's Navy on par with the naval forces of a superpower.

“The efforts of my comrades have become evident to everyone in the country, the region, and the world, bringing honor and pride to our dear Iran,” he said.

Your Email is not currect ! Qa'ani: US, Israel 'powerless in practice' against Iran, resistance
========================================================================

Thursday, 10 April 2025 5:17 PM  **\[ Last Update: Friday, 11 April 2025 9:19 AM \]**

! This is our strength,” Brigadier General Esmail Qa'ani said on Thursday. 

Last year, Iran hit military and intelligence targets inside the Israeli occupied territories with missile salvos in April and October. Iranian officials have underscored that the country only deployed a fraction of its firepower during the dual reprisal.

While Western military experts have also warned that future attacks could be still more complex and use an even greater number of missiles, the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) last week unveiled a new underground missile "megacity".

It was unveiled after US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with bombing if it doesn’t submit to American demands. *   [ ]

**The commander of Iran's Quds Force says the US and Israel, with all their hype and hoopla, are "powerless in practice" against Iran and resistance groups.** 

“They cannot even comprehend why our missiles accurately hit their targets. Qa'ani on Thursday emphasized the importance of self-sufficiency and domestic production.

He gave special plaudits to the resistance groups in the region “for having resisted with the least resources against the enemy’s advanced equipment”.

"As we saw in Lebanon and Yemen, the resistance has dealt the greatest blows to the enemy with the least resources,” he said. 

Qa'ani highlighted the unique characteristics of the Resistance Front, saying "the essence of resistance is that anyone who fights it only makes it stronger."

“Yemeni youths who could not even reach the Zionist regime with their weapons at the beginning of the war have increased the range of their missiles by 600 to 700 kilometers in a single year,” he said.  

“This kind of progress is unprecedented anywhere in the world,” General Qa'ani said, adding "the resources available to the Resistance Front today are the result of domestic efforts and innovations".

According to Ahmed Nagi, a senior analyst on Yemen at the International Crisis Group, the US is wrong to believe that airstrikes can compel Yemenis to back down. 

“Their logic is shaped by years of war; they see resilience as a form of strength and are driven to prove they are not easily deterred,” CNN quoted him as saying.

If anything, they may actually be relishing US strikes, the broadcaster said. Their operations are a “direct answer to their prayers to have a war with the US,” Farea al-Muslimi, a Yemeni research fellow at Chatham House, told CNN.

Since mid-March, Yemeni forces have launched a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships in solidarity with the Palestinians who are subject to daily massacres and other atrocities in Gaza and the West Bank."

Content: "Tehran denied the reports and Qaani eventually reemerged on state TV on October 15 during a funeral ceremony for a Quds Force commander killed alongside Nasrallah.

Despite his public return, questions remain about Qaani’s role during the recent conflict—and whether his disappearance reflected internal IRGC tensions or Israeli intelligence pressure.

Qaani has led the [Quds Force](https://www.ynetnews.com/topics/Quds_Force)
—the external operations arm of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)—since 2020, following the U.S. Iranian media offered no explanation for his disappearance or his whereabouts during the war, fueling further speculation.

! Iranian operatives under Quds Force command have attempted to assassinate Israeli diplomats and envoys in countries like Thailand, Georgia, India, Azerbaijan, Turkey and others.

Qaani has long been viewed as a less charismatic and more low-profile figure than Soleimani. Wearing civilian clothes and a black baseball cap, the Quds Force chief appeared in good health. President Donald Trump.

Under his leadership, the force has continued supporting proxy militias across the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq—what officials often refer to as Iran’s “ring of fire” surrounding Israel.

The Quds Force has also been tied to terror attacks abroad, including the 2012 bombing of an Israeli tourist bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, which killed five Israelis. Still, Israeli and Western analysts believed he was a key target in the opening stages of Israel’s recent Operation Rising Lion.

On June 13, The New York Times reported—based on unnamed sources—that Qaani had been killed in an Israeli strike alongside other senior Iranian military officials. That report was never officially confirmed and his reappearance Tuesday proves it was inaccurate.

This isn't the first time Qaani has vanished from public view under suspicious circumstances."

**Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting Joe Biden and Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his "victory plan", which the Ukrainian president hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.**

Details have been kept secret, but Zelensky is likely to ask the US president and vice-president for continuing military and financial support, as well as security guarantees.

It comes amid a row with Donald Trump and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.

They were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton with top Democrats. Zelensky will meet Trump on Friday despite earlier reports that the meeting had been cancelled.

Zelensky's visit to the ammunition factory in the key swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event.

In a public letter, speaker of the US House Mike Johnson said the visit was "designed to help Democrats" and claimed it amounted to "election interference".

He also demanded that Ukraine fire its ambassador to Washington who helped arrange the visit.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has also announced it would investigate whether Zelensky's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris's campaign.

Her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, mocked Zelensky at a campaign event as the "greatest salesman on Earth" and accused him of refusing to "make a deal" with Moscow.

Earlier this week, Trump also praised Russia's military capabilities, saying: "They beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon - that’s what they do, they fight."

The two men have long had a fractious relationship. In 2019, Trump was impeached by the US House over accusations that he pressured Ukraine's leader to dig up damaging information on a political rival.

The row clouded a week in which Zelensky has twice addressed the United Nations, ramping up efforts to persuade the US and other allies to boost support more than two and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion.

At the White House meetings, Zelensky is expected to push again for US backing to fire Western-made long-range missiles deep into Russian territory, which Biden has so far blocked.

Before the meeting, Biden said: "Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war... Ukraine will prevail".

He also pledged to support Kyiv "in its path to membership to both the EU and Nato".

Meanwhile, Zelensky thanked the US for its "unwavering bipartisan support".

He later met Harris, with the vice-president reiterating her support for Ukraine and arguing the US must continue its role of global leadership.

With Russian troops advancing in the east of Ukraine, the outcome of Zelensky's meeting with Biden and Harris is seen by many experts as a key moment in his attempt to shore up US support before the November election.

On Wednesday, Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a plan to revise Moscow's nuclear doctrine, to enable Russia to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states if they are supported by nuclear states.

Putin's spokesperson later clarified that it was meant as a "specific signal" to the West.

Hours before his meeting with Zelensky, Biden announced a $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.

The aid, part of a $61bn package that passed Congress in April, will be approved through presidential drawdown authority and will pull from existing Pentagon supplies to deliver the arms more quickly.

Congressional Republicans blocked the package for months earlier this year, before ultimately relenting and passing the legislation. The delay caused arms supplies to Ukraine to dry up for several months.

Zelensky thanked the US - Ukraine's largest foreign donor.

At the same time, he also reportedly expressed frustration at the delay in delivering weapons that were already promised when he met US congressmen on Thursday morning.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://apnews.com/hub/mike-johnson/)
 is calling on Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s [visit to an ammunition plant](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-ukraine-pennsylvania-ammunition-plant-c0e1fe5ebfa11ecfe92e842860e6440c)
 in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.

The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy [addressed the United Nations](https://apnews.com/video/war-and-unrest-ukraine-government-ukraine-russia-government-russia-eae042530895412f9447f6c70f7f27c1)
 in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the [war effort](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 before [meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House](https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-peace-plan-biden-russia-ukraine-d5e0d1aa9bf7d17e13609c2564d26489)
.

“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.

Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee [Donald Trump](https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump)
, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.

An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.

Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.

The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.

While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.

Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.

Trump in his own speech Wednesday [lashed out at Zelenskyy](https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-0f4d539aa73a943474d779716e5fe42a)
 and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.

Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”

Zelenskyy visited the [Scranton Army Ammunition Plant](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-75a9ca2e3be09578c65f1198ba5b72e5)
 to thank the workers who are producing one of the [most critically needed munitions](https://apnews.com/article/us-army-ukraine-russia-ammunition-war-e753d12f76ad3974184fc6aa2ed5125b)
 for [his country’s fight](https://apnews.com/hub/ukraine)
 to fend off Russian ground forces.

The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture [155 mm artillery shells](https://apnews.com/article/155mm-howitzer-ukraine-ammunition-russia-7d966c85046b73db2b013f93c51af2a5)
 and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.

“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.

“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”

Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.

Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he [visited Utah](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-governors-c777901001422bbc5e0885a1824a67c9)
 to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.

The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.

James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.

“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.

The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.

Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.

However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.

“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

### **CLAIM**

Posts claimed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed artillery shells destined to be dropped on Gaza during a visit to a Pennsylvania munitions factory.

* * *

### **BACKGROUND**

A video and still images shared online were described as showing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing artillery shells destined for use in Gaza by Israel.

One [version](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)
 of video was circulated online at the beginning of March with the caption: “For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky, here’s the Ukrainian President signing bombs to be dropped on innocent Gazans”. Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children”.

* * *

### **METHOD**

The video of Zelenskyy and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro signing artillery shells began to circulate online following an eventful meeting at the White House between Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on February 28 which turned into a near-shouting match. [![Eurovision News | Spotlight](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u-Oh!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82236b8f-82a2-4d9e-bc4b-1a00add2558a_1280x1280.png)](/)

Video caption falsely claims Zelenskyy signed bombs for Gaza

### The video actually shows him at a U.S. Available at: [Zelensky signing bombs that killed Palestinian women and children](https://x.com/Abdella07967637/status/1896372053160366410)
 \[Accessed 13 Mar. During the meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine. He also told Zelenskyy he was “[gambling with World War III](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/28/trump-vance-zelenskyy-oval-office-exchange-00206727)
”.

A reverse Google Image search of a screen shot from the video however revealed that it was published several months before the fateful White House meeting.

Governor Josh Shapiro shared the video on September 23, 2024, with a caption referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia. This version allowed us to see that Zelenskyy wrote “Glory to Ukraine” on one shell and “Thanks for Support” on another, both referencing Ukraine’s war with Russia and not Israel’s war in Gaza.

[Information](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-vidvidav-skrentonskij-armijskij-boyepripasnij-zavo-93389)
 about Zelenskyy’s visit to the ammunition factory, as well as details on its operations, was provided on Ukraine’s official government website.

“The plant’s capacity is fully dedicated to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly for the production of 155mm shells, which has significantly increased over the past year,” the statement read.

A statement regarding the visit was also released on the U.S. Army [website](https://www.army.mil/article/279911/ukrainian_president_zelenskyy_tours_scranton_army_ammunition_plant)
 which confirmed the factory was being used to bolster Ukraine’s ammunition stockpile.

* * *

### **RATING**

The video shows Zelenskyy visiting a munitions factory that produces armaments for the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces, not Israel. It was published five months before the February 2025 meeting and a longer version of the video reveals that Zelenskyy’s handwritten messages do not reference Ukraine’s war with Russia or Israel’s war in Gaza. Available at: [For those feeling sorry for Volodymyr Zelensky](https://x.com/firasshams1/status/1896565304148574479)

Zelenskyy's "Glory to Ukraine" inscription on US bombs in Pennsylvania stirs controversy
========================================================================================

15 October 2024 18:57

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to Pennsylvania has stirred significant controversy, raising questions about the intersection of foreign diplomacy and US electoral politics.** 

During a tour aimed at bolstering support for Ukraine, Zelenskyy made headlines after signing munitions at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant, a move that has elicited mixed reactions from both local residents and political leaders, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-american-lean-donald-trump-despite-ukraine-war-dupont-pennsylvania/)** Politico.

While at the plant, Zelenskyy inscribed messages of gratitude on US bombs, including the phrase “Glory to Ukraine.” Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, who was present during the signing, appeared supportive of the gesture. “Because you’re signing bombs that could potentially kill innocent people.

Five potential conflicts: Which could turn nuclear? There’s innocent on both sides.”

The backlash against Zelenskyy’s visit was further amplified by political commentators and Republican leaders. Reports indicate that Zelenskyy’s remarks about the Republican candidate for US vice president, whom he labeled as radical, only fueled this perception.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a prominent Republican figure, also condemned Zelenskyy's presence at the military plant, asserting that such actions could jeopardize Ukraine’s long-term objectives in its fight against Russia. “We need to ensure that incidents like this do not detract from the long-term goals of ensuring success for Ukraine,” Graham remarked.

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

Proud return: the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara arrives at Istanbul’s Sarayburnu port on 26 December 2010 after the Israeli navy raid on the vessel, part of a flotilla of aid ships bound for Gaza, on 31 May 2010

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

US Ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan within an informal meeting of The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) foreign ministers in Antalya, on May 15, 2025. Speaking to TGRT television, he criticized Israel’s involvement in Syria and voiced opposition to attempts at ethnic division under the guise of “preserving national identity.”

“Syria is next to us, and any unrest there directly affects us,” Fidan said. Abdulkadir Selvi, a journalist close to the government, wrote in Hürriyet that US Special Representative for Syria Tom Barrack has adopted “a softer tone.” Barrack, who once insisted on “one nation, one people, one army, and one Syria,” has reportedly floated the idea of a “looser arrangement.”

“This stance by the US ambassador has caused concern in Ankara,” Selvi wrote, suggesting the shift may signal changes in Washington’s Syria policy.

**Regional Tensions Over Minority Demands**

Selvi also reported that Israel has pressed the US administration to secure privileges for Druze communities [under its influence in Syria](https://levant24.com/tag/hijri/)
. He claimed the SDF and affiliated groups are using those demands as leverage to seek similar concessions.

Amid these competing pressures, Abdi has resisted full integration into the Syrian army despite the March 10 agreement and calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. (AFP)

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said developments in Syria remain a critical concern for Ankara, warning that any unrest directly impacts Turkey. Joe Wilson, centered on integrating the forces into the Syrian state through a decentralized model.

A source from the autonomous administration (AANES) told ANHA that negotiations with Damascus face obstacles but remain ongoing."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from [en.majalla.com](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:11679>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:11686>. It also mentions a meeting of Druze leaders on March 14, 2025 <image:11685>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:11686>.

Another article from [mondediplo.com](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025 <image:1>, and that Greece made strides in the global fight against antisemitism in January 2025. Finally, an article from [www.timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:11692>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025, and gave a speech on March 30, 2025. The evidence also mentions talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, the evidence does not mention whether Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

Content: "Trump said the Turkish leader will be coming to Washington at an unspecified date and that Erdogan invited him to Turkey as well.

Trump and Erdogan’s strong relationship has been a sore point for Israel, which has been at odds with Turkey over the war in Gaza and more recently the rise of Ahmed al-Sharaa’s regime in Syria.

Erdogan’s office said that the Turkish leader told Trump Ankara “is ready to cooperate and provide all kinds of support to establish a \[Gaza\] ceasefire and ensure lasting peace.” He also told Trump that US efforts to ease sanctions on Syria would “contribute” to stabilizing the war-torn country.

[! (AP/Susan Walsh/File)

Washington has said any normalization or lifting of sanctions following the December ouster of Bashar al-Assad will depend on verifiable progress by Syria’s new authorities on priorities including actions against “terror.”

Erdogan also thanked Trump for his “approach to ending wars,” with the statement mentioning Ukraine, Gaza and negotiations on Iran.

NATO member Turkey has sought to maintain good relations with both of its Black Sea neighbors since the Russian invasion and has twice hosted talks aimed at ending the war.

The Turkish leader raised the issue of the war-battered Gaza Strip, telling Trump that humanitarian aid should “be delivered to Gaza without interruption.”

Erdogan has been one of the most harshly critical foreign leaders of Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, accusing Jerusalem of genocide and war crimes, praising ICC arrest warrants against Israeli leaders, and calling on the UN to recommend the use of force against Israel.

The Turkish leader earlier this year [also dismissed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/erdogan-trumps-plan-to-oust-gazans-from-eternal-homeland-unworthy-of-discussion/)
 Trump’s controversial plan to displace the residence of Gaza in order to rebuild the Strip as a tourist hub as having “nothing worth considering or discussing.”

[! Erdogan has blasted Israel’s military presence in Syria, while Jerusalem has accused the Turkish leader of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate.

While Netanyahu was in Washington last month, [Trump said he could help](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-suggests-he-can-mediate-between-israel-and-turkey-on-syria/)

Trump appeared to acknowledge Turkey’s dominance in Syria, saying he told Erdogan he had “taken it over through surrogates.”

US President Donald Trump said Monday that he had held a “very good and productive” phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with topics including Gaza, Syria, Ukraine, and Iran.

Trump said the pair discussed the wars in both Gaza and Ukraine, while Erdogan’s office said in its own readout that the Turkish leader highlighted the gravity of the humanitarian crisis in the Strip.

“I look forward to working with President Erdogan on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

The two leaders also discussed “all things Syria, Gaza and more,” said Trump, who touted his “excellent” relationship with Erdogan. <image:11703>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/03/DSC09999blur-e1741768753143.jpg)

Soldiers of the IDF’s Alpinist unit are seen at an IDF post in the Mount Hermon area in southern Syria, March 11, 2025. You’ve taken over Syria.’ With different names, but same thing,” Trump said at the time.

In his own comments in the White House last month, Netanyahu said, “We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel.”

Netanyahu added that he and Trump “discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose.”

Last month, Israel and Turkey confirmed that they were holding deconfliction talks hosted by Azerbaijan to avoid potential clashes or misunderstandings in Syria.

The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from [en.majalla.com](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:11679>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:11686>. It also mentions a meeting of Druze leaders on March 14, 2025 <image:11685>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:11686>.

Another article from [mondediplo.com](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025 <image:1>, and that Greece made strides in the global fight against antisemitism in January 2025. Finally, an article from [www.timesofisrael.com](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/) reports on talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, including a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:11692>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025, and gave a speech on March 30, 2025. The evidence also mentions talks between Israel and Turkey regarding Syria in February 2025, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, the evidence does not mention whether Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss Turkey's relationship with the U.S., Israel, and Syria.  An article from [levant24.com](https://levant24.com/news/2025/08/turkey-watchful-as-sdf-delays-implementation-of-march-deal/) mentions a meeting between the US Ambassador to Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Minister on May 15, 2025 <image:11694>.  An article from [jinsa.org](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf) reports that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated."  A Reuters article from [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/erdogan-trump-discuss-ukraine-syria-defence-issues-turkey-says-2025-03-16/) reports that on March 16, 2025, Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about Syria <image:11695>.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that on March 16, 2025, Turkish President Erdogan spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump about Syria. Furthermore, on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified. The evidence suggests Erdogan's strong stance against Israel and communication with the U.S. regarding Syria, but it does not confirm the specific action of urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Israel’s air-defense system passes test in fending off Iranian missile strike
=============================================================================

[World](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world)
 Oct 2, 2024 1:49 PM EDT

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran’s latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday’s night’s strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

### Iron Dome

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

### Iron Beam

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

**WATCH:** [Middle East again on edge after largest aerial attack ever launched against Israel](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/middle-east-again-on-edge-after-largest-aerial-attack-ever-launched-against-israel)

In Tuesday’s attack, the U.S. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel’s air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Israeli leaders say the system isn’t 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here’s a closer look at Israel’s multilayered air-defense system:

### The Arrow

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday."

Iranian missile strikes show Israel’s aerial defense array is not ironclad

Iranian missile strikes show Israel’s aerial defense array is not ironclad
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 of 3 | 

Air raid sirens sounded across Israel on Friday night as Iranian missiles were launched towards the country. assistance, has developed a tiered system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure while letting other projectiles land in open spaces.

The array can shoot down short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to ballistic missiles like those Iran has been firing.

But the military warns the system is not fool proof and while interception rates are generally high, enemy missiles can penetrate. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems.

According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
PBS News Hour reported on October 2, 2024, that Israel's air-defense system intercepted projectiles fired from Iran, with the Iron Dome having a success rate of over 90% during the attack. The article mentions that Iran fired over 180 missiles. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-air-defense-system-passes-test-in-fending-off-iranian-missile-strike)) <image:227>

The Associated Press published an article discussing the Iranian missile strikes on Israel, mentioning that the Iron Dome is not foolproof, and interception rates are generally high. ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-air-defense-f0e72fa1c1dba6bc08fcc0bfb0c5a9f0](https://apnews.com/article/israel-air-defense-f0e72fa1c1dba6bc08fcc0bfb0c5a9f0)) <image:k>, <image:l>, <image:m>


## Elaboration
The PBS News Hour article states that the Iron Dome had a success rate of over 90% during the attack. The article also mentions that Iran fired over 180 missiles. The Associated Press article also mentions that the Iron Dome's interception rates are generally high.

Based on the evidence, the claim is likely true.

In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand.

!In Syria, an abandoned tank has become a fruit and vegetable stand. <image:2101>

15.12.2024 20:50

In Syria, a tank abandoned by regime forces became a fruit and vegetable stand.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 27, clashes intensified between regime-opposing armed groups and Bashar al-Assad's forces in Syria. The groups had gained dominance in the largest provinces such as Aleppo, Idlib, Hama, and Homs between November 30 and December 7. As the groups began to enter the capital Damascus on December 7, with support from the masses, the regime completely lost control in Damascus and many other regions, leading to its collapse. The 61-year rule of the Ba'ath Party came to an end, and regime leader Assad fled the capital.

### OPERATION DAWN OF FREEDOM

Meanwhile, the Syrian National Army had liberated the center of the Tel Rifaat district from the terrorist organization PKK/YPG on the first day of the Operation Dawn of Freedom, which was launched in December. With the liberation of the Manbij district during the operation, the region, which had turned into the largest terrorist stronghold west of the Euphrates River, was cleared of PKK/YPG.

### ABANDONED TANK BECAME A FRUIT STAND

On the other hand, an abandoned tank by regime forces became a fruit stand. The image showed various fruits and vegetables being sold on the tank's surface.

The website also has other news articles from July 20, 2025. <image:2101>


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image is of a vegetable stand using a tank. The reverse image search indicates that the image is from Syria, not Gaza. The article is dated December 15, 2024. The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Turkey.

The claim that the image is from Gaza and features a Merkava tank is incorrect. The tank in the image is not identified as a Merkava tank.

Oct. 30, 2023, 2:03 PM EDT

By [Mithil Aggarwal](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mithil-aggarwal-ncpn1288084)

A car was fired upon by what appeared to be an Israeli tank on the outskirts of [Gaza City](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/video-shows-convoy-of-u-n-vehicles-leaving-gaza-city-195115077802)
, an eyewitness told NBC News on Monday, as the major ground offensive in the Palestinian enclave drew more international calls for civilians to be protected.

Freelance photographer Bashar Talib said he was traveling in a nearby vehicle on the Salah Al Deen road when the vehicle was hit.

The driver of the white car saw the tank “at the last minute,” he said. “He was close to the tank and the bulldozer. He stopped his car to go back, but he was targeted before driving,” Talib added. 

[**_Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas conflict_**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-rcna123108)

Video shot by his colleague Youssef Al-Saifi, a local journalist, who was traveling with him, shows a white car moving ahead of them down the road. As their vehicle slows down, the white car slows down and starts to turn around.

Just as it starts to drive away in the opposite direction, the tank then fires a round that hits its back end and black smoke erupts. 

The vehicle carrying Talib and Al-Saifi then turns around and drives away quickly. “The man is dead, a whole family,” they scream as it speeds up. 

NBC News could not independently verify that a family was in the white car. 

Asked about the incident by NBC News, the IDF said it would not comment on the positions of its forces inside Gaza. But IDF Maj. Nir Dinar told [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-gaza-war-latest/card/witness-describes-seeing-israeli-tank-fire-on-taxi-southeast-of-gaza-city-MxFhMYxmv3QxQXpGcpHk)
 that “terrorists use civilian infrastructure like cars. They don’t have tanks or military jeeps.”

Driving in the opposite direction, Talib said they passed “a bus filled with civilians and children” moving straight toward the white car and the tank. 

Although they shouted for it to “go back,” he said the driver did not hear them because he was traveling too quickly. 

The incident took place hours after Israel’s military said it had struck more than 600 militant targets over the past few days as it expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. 

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told a news conference that the IDF would “continue and intensify” its ground operation and “additional forces” had entered the besieged enclave over the last day. Some of them had fought with “terrorists who barricaded themselves in buildings,” he said.    

Meanwhile, as the war enters its fourth week, aid agencies are warning that Palestinian civilians are in dire need of fuel, food and clean water as Gaza’s infrastructure has reached a point of near collapse. On Saturday, crowds of people broke into four U.N. facilities and took food supplies. The United Nations said this was a sign that civil order was starting to break down. 

With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other lifesaving equipment. 

A spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society said Monday that blasts had rung out less than 200 feet from the Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, which is sheltering thousands of people. 

Strikes hit near Gaza City’s Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals and the Indonesian and Turkish hospitals in northern Gaza in recent days, the U.N. said.

After Talib and Al-Saifi shared their video of the tank blasting the car, it was posted by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which described its passengers as martyrs.

“God spared our lives,” he said. “If there was no car driving in front of us, we would be targeted.”

Penny Wong urges Israel to end Rafah offensive as Israeli forces reportedly reach city's centre

Israel has pounded Rafah with air strikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive in the southern Gaza city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, [killing at least 45 people](/news/2024-05-27/israel-military-prosecutor-says-rafah-strike-under-investigation/103899588)
.

Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of displaced families from elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Tuesday the military had fired two 17-kilogram munitions in the strike that targeted two senior Hamas militants.

He said the munitions would have been too small to ignite a fire on their own, and the army was looking into the possibility that weapons were stored in the area.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the air strikes on Rafah showed why an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was needed.

She said Australia had been very clear that Israel must not proceed with its operation there.

"The death and destruction in Rafah is horrific. This human suffering is unacceptable," Senator Wong said, speaking at Senate estimates on Tuesday.

"We reiterate to the government of Israel: This cannot continue.

"We must see an immediate humanitarian ceasefire so civilians can be protected and Australia continues to support the work of the United States, Qatar and Egypt to that end.

"We continue to call for the release of all hostages by Hamas and for Israel to allow aid to flow at scale, as directed by the International Court of Justice."

Several Israeli tanks on Tuesday reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza Strip city that has has drawn intense scrutiny from neighbouring Egypt and from the United States.

The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses said. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on their account, saying it would issue a statement about the Rafah operation later.

At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighbourhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents to news agency Reuters.

Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but had not yet entered the city in full force.

Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago.

They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded.

"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night," one resident told Reuters over a chat app.

One million have fled Rafah in past three weeks, UNRWA says
-----------------------------------------------------------

Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Tuesday.

Israel has kept up attacks despite [a ruling by the top UN court](/news/2024-05-24/un-top-court-orders-israel-to-half-rafah-offensive/103892078)
 on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there.

More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.

In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.

On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighbourhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached.

Spain, Norway, Ireland recognise Palestinian state
--------------------------------------------------

Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza.

Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire and hoped their decision would spur other European Union countries to follow suit.

"It's the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognises as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address.

Spain was recognising a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said.

The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision.

Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy.

Norway had until recently followed the position of the United States, which insists that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue, but lost confidence that this strategy would work.

"In the middle of a war, with tens of thousands of dead and injured, we must keep alive the only thing that can provide a safe home for both Israelis and Palestinians: two states that can live in peace with each other," Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said last week.

Israel has repeatedly condemned the move and said it bolsters Hamas.

"Sanchez, when you … recognise a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes," Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday.

Denmark's parliament on Tuesday voted down a bill to recognise a Palestinian state, after the Danish foreign minister previously said the necessary preconditions for an independent country were lacking.

![Israeli tanks head towards the Gaza Strip border](/themes/custom/ccga/frontend/static-html/images/placeholder.png)

Young Russians may be more likely than their elders to give Israel the benefit of the doubt in its conflict with Hamas.

Introduction
------------

Unlike most Western and Western-aligned countries, Israel refused to [sanction or cut ties](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 with Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022 and has since [maintained its neutrality](https://www.cfr.org/article/why-israel-has-been-slow-support-ukraine)
 in the conflict. At the time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a [close personal relationship](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/11/israel-and-russia-the-end-of-a-friendship?lang=en)
 that had sustained warm relations between their countries for over a decade. However, their relationship cooled in 2023, as Russia and Iran began to develop a [major bilateral agreement](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202501046766)
 to expand their military, economic, and political cooperation that was [signed just last week](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/russia-and-iran-presidents-sign-partnership-treaty-in-moscow)
.

Relations between Israel and Russia further deteriorated in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack against Israel. Putin refused to designate the group as a terrorist organization and instead invited a delegation from Hamas to Moscow for peace talks, calling for a [two-state solution](https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-tells-abbas-great-pain-palestinian-plight-2024-08-13/)
 to the longstanding conflict.

Data from a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Levada Analytical Center survey, fielded September 26-October 2, 2024, finds that most Russians share Putin’s view of the conflict and believe Israeli military operations in Gaza are unjustified. However, the data reveal some differences in attitudes toward the war between young Russians and those from older generations.

Young Russians are Less Critical of Israeli Military Operations in Gaza
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the Kremlin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinian people, most Russians do not side with either party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (57%). However, among those who do choose a side, more side with Palestinians (28%) than with Israelis (6%). Young Russians are more likely to say they want to remain neutral in the conflict than older generations, who, by comparison, are less likely to be impartial and much more likely to side with Palestinians. Less than two in 10 Russians between 18-34 (14%) place themselves on the side of Palestinians, compared to four in 10 of the oldest cohort (40%).

Russian youth also have different opinions on Israel’s military operations in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack. Most Russians (59%) believe Israel has gone too far and its military actions are not justified, but young Russians are the least likely to say so (45%). In fact, they are nearly 30 percentage points less likely to say Israel has gone too far than the oldest cohort of Russians (70%). By contrast, they are the age group most likely to say Israel is justified and defending its interests (22%) or decline to answer the question entirely (33%).

…. and View Israel and the United States More Favorably
-------------------------------------------------------

As the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East, Israel is likely perceived by Russians as being aligned with the West and is, as a result, viewed unfavorably by much of the population. Half of Russians express a negative view of Israel (51%), while less than a third (27%) say they feel very or somewhat good about the country.

Young Russians are divided in their views of Israel, as nearly as many express a negative opinion (37%) as express a positive one (42%). However, they are much more likely than older Russians—majorities of whom express a negative view—to say they feel positively about Israel.

In the same vein, Russian youth are more likely to think Israel plays a positive role in resolving the key challenges facing the Middle East (23%) than other age groups, though nearly half (48%) contend that the country plays a negative role in the region. On this they differ from most Russians overall, who believe Israel plays a negative role in resolving regional challenges (60%), second only to the United States (71% negative role), which is viewed the most negatively. On the other hand, the majority of Russians (82%) believe their own country plays the most positive role in the region, followed by Iran (43%).

Russian youth also place less blame on the United States or Israel for the continued bloodshed and instability faced by the Middle East than do older Russians. Young Russians are the least likely to say that Israel (16%) or the United States and other Western countries (30%) are responsible for the conflict in the Middle East and are the most likely to place blame on Hamas and the Palestinians (12%) or no one in particular (16%).

Among the broader population, most consider the United States and other Western countries most responsible for the continued bloodshed and instability in the Middle East (38%)—even more than Israel (22%) or Hamas (8%).

Social Media Contributes to Young Russians’ Alternative Views
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, pluralities of both Russian youth and older generations do not side with either party in the conflict, believe Israeli military operations in Gaza have gone too far, and blame the United States and other Western countries for the continued bloodshed in the region. However, younger Russians do so to a lesser extent than their elders and view Israel, the United States, and the West through a relatively more positive lens.

Why might this be? A [February 2024 Chicago Council-Levada Center survey](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-are-skeptical-most-media-outlets)
 of just the youth population finds that they primarily receive their news and information about the world from digital media sources, like social media platforms, Telegram channels, and blogs. Unlike older generations, who most often turn to traditional, state-controlled media outlets like television, radio, and newspapers for their news, young Russians are exposed to more diverse sources of information online that are less censored and restricted by the Russian government. As a result, their political sentiments and views of Russian foreign policies differ from those of older generations, who are more likely to accept state narratives that are propagated through traditional media outlets.

Conclusion
----------

Despite the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and Russia’s withdrawal from the country, Putin’s diplomatic support for the Palestinians, Hamas, and Iran has helped to counter Western influence in the Middle East and emphasize Russia’s role in the region. While young Russians share Putin’s anti-Western outlook on the conflict, they may be more likely to give Israel the benefit of the doubt than older generations of Russians.

Generational differences in views toward the Israel-Gaza war may exist as a result of the youth population’s exposure to diverse narratives and sources of information online. In the current atmosphere that squelches dissent or protest in Russia, it is possible that young Russians may be projecting their position on their own country’s war in Ukraine onto their views of the war in the Middle East. Russian youth are far less likely than their elders to [personally support the military operation in Ukraine](https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/young-russians-feel-more-threatened-terrorism-war-ukraine)
 and could be voicing some opposition to the state’s official narratives about both conflicts.

 and the [Axis of Resistance](/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance "Axis of Resistance")
, including [Hezbollah](/wiki/Hezbollah "Hezbollah")
, in light of the ongoing [Israeli–Lebanese conflict](/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese_conflict "Israeli–Lebanese conflict")

Attack
------

On October 19, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea was targeted by one of three drones, believed to have been launched from Lebanon. She reported that sirens had gone off around Caesarea only after the attack on Netanyahu's residence was confirmed.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

Responses
---------

### Israel

Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack an attempted assassination against himself and his wife [Sara Netanyahu](/wiki/Sara_Netanyahu "Sara Netanyahu")
 conducted by Iranian proxies, stating that they had "made a bitter mistake".[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 He further stated that the attack would not hinder or dissuade Israel from "the war of revival" against Israel's enemies and to ensure Israel's security for generations.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8)

[Israeli foreign minister](/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel) "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)")
 [Israel Katz](/wiki/Israel_Katz "Israel Katz")
 also stated that the attack was an assassination attempt against Netanyahu and his family conducted by Iranian proxies, and called the attack another exposure of "Iran’s true face and the evil axis it leads".[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

### Axis of Resistance

[Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran")
 stated that Hezbollah was responsible for the reported attack, according to the state-run [Islamic Republic News Agency](/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency "Islamic Republic News Agency")
, which quoted Iran's mission to the UN stating, "The action in question has been carried out by Hezbollah in Lebanon."[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)

Hezbollah stated that it had conducted multiple rocket strikes across north and central Israel on the same day of the attack, although it did not explicitly state that it was responsible for the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)
 Hezbollah later claimed responsibility for the attack on 22 October 2024.[\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

Al Jazeera reporter Nour Odeh called the attack a matter of concern for [Israeli security forces](/wiki/Israeli_security_forces "Israeli security forces")
, due to the fact that the drone successfully struck its intended target 70 kilometers (43 miles) away from the Lebanese border without triggering any sirens.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:0-2)

### International

[United States Secretary of Defense](/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense")
 [Lloyd Austin](/wiki/Lloyd_Austin "Lloyd Austin")
, after receiving information regarding the attack from [Israel's Minister of Defense](/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel) "Ministry of Defense (Israel)")
 [Yoav Gallant](/wiki/Yoav_Gallant "Yoav Gallant")
, was reported to have been "relieved" that Netanyahu survived, and began to review adjustments to United States operations in the Middle East, including the deployment of a [Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense](/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense "Terminal High Altitude Area Defense")
 system to bolster Israeli defense against the Axis of Resistance.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:1-3)

[British Prime Minister](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom")
 [Sir Keir Starmer](/wiki/Keir_Starmer "Keir Starmer")
 held a call with Netanyahu following the attack, expressing alarm at the use of drones.[\[11\]](#cite_note-11)

Content: "The IDF said the drone was one of three launched from Lebanon, and that the other two were shot down.

And yet, despite this escalation against the elected premier, some political leaders, journalists, and social media influencers rendered it as a personal saga about the Netanyahus and their public image.

Using inflammatory, cynical, sometimes humorous posts, some reactions invoked perceptions of the couple as power-hungry greedy rulers, while others gave new life to the view that he was a mere victim of the legal system and political rivals that sought to bring him down.

### An assassination attempt on ‘me and my wife’

Netanyahu himself [described the attack](https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1847686585552134536)
 not as one targeting a head of government, but rather highlighted it as an assassination attempt on “me and my wife.”

He was quickly echoed by Shas party leader Aryeh Deri, a close Netanyahu ally whose electorate consists of hardcore Netanyahu supporters, who [tweeted](https://x.com/ariyederi/status/1847917421463519497)
 his support Sunday: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, stay strong and courageous.”

The Likud party followed suit and weaponized the attack against Netanyahu’s political rivals, [accusing](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/yesh-atid-says-lapid-condemned-drone-attack-on-pms-residence-in-radio-interview-slams-likud-for-lying/)
 Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and National Unity chief Benny Gantz of failing to condemn it.

“At the moment of truth, they’ve failed to overcome petty politics and big egos,” said a statement issued Sunday by the Likud. <image:5540>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/1-21-e1729439173461.jpg)

A meme posted to Omer Ashkenazi’s Facebook page of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his family following the October 19, 2024, drone attack targeting his house in Israel, stating, ‘Bring Us Home Now.’ (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

### A property tax issue

Both Gantz and The Democrats party head Yair Golan chose to characterize the attack as yet another instance in which Netanyahu was simply looking out for his property, invoking his public image as greedy and self-serving.

“At a time when hundreds of rockets are being launched at the citizens of Israel … citizens are being murdered and soldiers are falling — the Prime Minister is busy with himself and the property tax,” the National Unity party stated Sunday.

This came after the Kan public broadcaster had reported that property tax officials and a gardener visited Netanyahu’s home following the attack.

Golan, whose Democrats party is a merger of Labor and Meretz, retorted during an interview Saturday on “Meet the Press,” “If renovating the house without it being hit by a drone wasn’t a problem, there wouldn’t be a problem afterward. <image:5541>](https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2024/10/2-18.jpg)

Residents gather on a street leading to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea on October 19, 2024, after a drone fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon targeted his house and exploded nearby. (used in accordance with Clause 27a of the Copyright Law)

Fellow Haaretz journalist Uri Misgav, a long-time critic of Netanyahu who has extensively written about the prime minister’s alleged use of public funds to cover personal expenses, assailed the censor’s imposed restrictions in covering the story while similarly downplaying concerns of material damages as a result of the attack.

“I find it somewhat funny that since yesterday, the military censor has instructed not to report where exactly the drone struck in Caesarea, even though property tax officials have already arrived at the scene,” he [posted to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/nhavip123/posts/10234099090079390)
.

### Taking a swipe at Netanyahu’s legal and political adversaries

Moti Kastel, a journalist for Channel 14 considered by many to be a Netanyahu mouthpiece, chose to blame the premier’s perceived nemeses for the supposed tragedy averted at the last minute.

He [tweeted](https://x.com/KastelMoti/status/1847704742249541815)
: “This would be a good time to mention that Attorneys General Gali Baharav-Miara and Shlomit Barnea Farago — who are systematically obstructing and delaying vital requests for reinforcement at the prime minister’s residences – are risking his and his wife’s lives while leaking it to the media as ‘protecting and safeguarding’ public funds.”

Attorney-General Baharav-Miara oversees the prosecution of Netanyahu’s corruption charges; Barnea Farago is the legal adviser at the Prime Minister’s office.

Journalist and social media influencer Yotam Zimri took a swipe at Lapid for initially not condemning the failed attempt to target Netanyahu, [saying](https://x.com/YotYotam/status/1847883065705541946)
 that Lapid, “Doesn’t comment on failures.”

### Humorous fusion

And then there are the regular Israelis, who are coping with the news through cynical, sometimes dark, humor, fusing together unrelated stories.

One Facebook user [posted a meme](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=3912514032404399&set=p.3912514032404399)
 invoking [Netanyahu’s attempt to rename the war as The War of Revival](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-suggests-changing-name-of-gaza-war-to-war-of-revival/)
.

It depicts the Netanyahus standing in their swimming pool, saying: “If you have a problem renovating our pool during the war, we’ll call it the Revival Pool.”

Another user propagated a cynical conspiracy theory suggesting Netanyahu had hoped for his home to be destroyed, presumably for reasons relating to property tax.

“Israel has no foreign policy, only domestic politics,” according to a saying attributed to Henry Kissinger.

This couldn’t be more reflective of some of the reactions to [Hezbollah’s drone targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-drone-targets-netanyahus-house-in-caesarea-pm-wife-not-home-no-injuries/)
 on Saturday.

The prime minister and his wife were not present at the house and no injuries were reported. And the state will pay, don’t worry.”

Several left-leaning journalists similarly chose to narrow the story down to the material damage the attack might have caused to Netanyahu’s house.

Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson [commented](https://x.com/chaimlevinson/status/1847939700037697686)
 on a report whereby Director General of the Prime Minister’s Office Yossi Shelley, who also heads the Tekuma administration responsible for rebuilding the Gaza enclave, had already met with tax officials, cynically juxtaposing it with the slower treatment ordinary residents receive.

“Kudos to Yossi Shelley for quickly addressing every single house destroyed or damaged throughout the north."

Lebanese militant group Hezbollah vowed to escalated fighting against Israel yesterday, following the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by the Israeli military.

In a statement released yesterday morning, it announced "the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy," which it said will be "elaborated upon" in the coming days.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas, said “the spirit of resistance” would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza.

Israel targets three hospitals in Gaza, says health ministry

The IDF is “besieging and directly targeting” three hospitals in northern Gaza, threatening to put them out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry said this morning.

It said the IDF was attacking the Indonesian Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, and Al-Awda Hospital, and appealed to the international community to intervene "to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip."

According to the health ministry, hospital staff and at least 40 patients and wounded are trapped the Indonesian Hospital, as Israeli "artillery targeted the upper floors" of the hospital, as well as a group of displaced people in front of its gates.

The "heavy gunfire," towards the building and courtyards was "causing great panic among patients and medical staff," the health ministry said.

In a statement, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was "no intentional fire directed at it."

A “Palestinian terrorist” attempted to drive a car at a police vehicle at the entrance to the Ofra settlement in the Israeli occupied West Bank, the IDF said this morning.

It said the driver of the vehicle was killed and that no Israeli soldiers were injured.

The IDF added that the incident was under review.

A drone strike was launched towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the town of Caesarea, north of Tel Aviv, on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli Prime Minister’s office.

Netanyahu and his wife were not in the building, and there were no casualties.

The Israel Defense Forces said a drone crossing from Lebanon “hit a structure in the area of Caesarea,” while Israeli news outlet Ynet reported the sound of an explosion in the town.

The attack comes just days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar during a military operation in the Gaza Strip.

Sinwar was the architect of of Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, and his killing in battle was the culmination of a yearlong manhunt by the IDF, but the latest strikes have provided a quick reality to check for any hopes his death could spell an end to the conflict.

At least 55 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israel in the space of an hour on Saturday morning, according to the Israeli military.

Sirens had begun to sound across Israel ahead of the latest wave of missiles, including in the port city of Haifa which has come under heavy fire from Hezbollah rockets in recent weeks.

NBC News staff in Israel said in the north, sirens were sounding non-stop Saturday morning for more than four hours.

Analysis: Sinwar’s final moments evoke uncomfortable parallels to Israel hero

Shira Pinson

Dramatic footage released by the Israeli military that purport to show Yahya Sinwar’s final moments will be etched in the Palestinian national memory for generations to come: the defiance of Sinwar, covered in dust and with his right arm blown off, yet still fighting.

It’s an image that brings to mind an uncomfortable comparison to Israel’s national hero Joseph Trumpeldor, the one-armed Zionist resistance fighter.

![Image:](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241019-sinwar-still-aa-f93d1a.jpg)

A video still of Sinwar in his final moments, released by the IDF. For them, this was a military commander fighting to the last, willing to sacrifice not only the lives of thousands of Israelis and tens of thousands of Palestinians — but also his own.

Reporting from Aitou, Lebanon

The scene of carnage in [northern Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/lebanon)
 showed heartbreaking snippets of everyday family life.

A dead baby inside a destroyed pickup truck; a child’s severed arm buried in nearby rubble; toddler clothing and books shredded; flies swarming as officials collected body parts, some too small for body bags ending up in clear ziplock bags.

Pervading everything, the overwhelming stench of rotting flesh mixed with concrete dust at the scene where 23 people including two children were killed, according to local officials.

This was the aftermath of an airstrike Monday on the Lebanese Christian village of Aitou that Israel said had targeted a position held by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.

Until then, this region of hilly olive groves and winding, sea-view roads had been a relative haven, one that felt far away from the war dominating Beirut and the country’s south.

Just last week, the area “was calm; everything was quiet,” Illy Edwan told NBC News as he surveyed the wreckage of his villa, which was reduced to rubble in the blast, its insulation and inner structure ripped to pieces, an adjacent vehicle twisted open like a burnt pretzel.

“My house used to be three-story, but look at it today,” he added.

Hundreds are dead and thousands more have been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as the IDF deepens its offensive in the area and sends more troops to fight.

The IDF laid siege to the camp 15 days ago, surrounding it with tanks while raining down artillery fire. Another person is in moderate condition after they were injured by shrapnel near the commercial center in Ein Hafaretz.

Air strikes have hit a suburb in Lebanon's capital Beirut this afternoon, less than an hour after the IDF ordered residents to evacuate the area.

Lebanon’s state-run national news agency said that a building in Haret Hreik was struck twice, and a plume of smoke was also seen rising from the area.

IDF spokesperson Avicahy Adraee had earlier given evacuation orders for the area.

Adraee issued multiple evacuation warnings today to residents in parts of southern Beirut, warning of future military operations in the area.

Spokesperson Avichay Adraee also ordered residents located in Choueifet Al-Umara and Borj El Brajneh to leave, saying they were "near facilities and interests belonging to Hezbollah," and urged people to evacuate.

Two patients have died inside the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza due to Israel's siege on the area, according to the local health ministry.

It said the patients died "as a result of the hospital's siege and the power outage and lack of medical supplies."

In a statement earlier today, the IDF confirmed operations near the Indonesian Hospital, but said that there was “no intentional fire directed at it.”

The war in Gaza "continues unabated," Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian relief said, days after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, raising a fleeting hope it could bring an end to the war.

At least 20,000 people had been forced to flee northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp as Israel deepens its offensive in the region, Lazzarini said, and there are shortages of the most basic needs, like food, water and blankets."

Two more drones that crossed into Israeli territory were intercepted, the military said.

There were no casualties reported, according to the Israeli ambulance service and police said explosions had been heard in Caesarea, coastal town where Netanyahu has a holiday home.

The drone attack was not immediately claimed by the Lebanese Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel since last October, or any other militant group.

The two other drones were intercepted, the Israeli military said, adding that more than 100 rockets were fired at northern Israel from Lebanon, killing one person and injuring at least 13.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Iran-aligned Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since October last year. Sirens were activated across northern Israel, including in the cities of Galilee and Haifa, she said.

Haifa is the largest city in northern Israel and is seen as a strategic port city that is home to 300,000 people and the country’s naval headquarters.

“The sirens went off just right after we got confirmation that a drone attack actually succeeded in targeting and striking the house of the Israeli prime minister in Caesarea,” Odeh said.

Israeli strikes
---------------

Later on Saturday, the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health reported that four people were killed and 13 wounded in an Israeli air strike on an apartment building in the eastern town of Baaloul in the Western Bekaa district.

Israeli air strikes also hit the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanese state media said, marking the first attacks in three days on the area.

Footage from the news agency AFP showed plumes of smoke rising over the area, less than an hour after the Israeli military issued an evacuation order to its residents.

Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported two Israeli strikes on one building in the neighbourhood of Haret Hreik and later added that Israeli warplanes had struck the al-Umara neighbourhood in nearby Choueifat.

Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah targets.

On September 23, Israel launched an intense air campaign on Lebanon and later sent in ground forces after nearly a year of cross-border exchanges of fire with Hezbollah over the Gaza war.

At least 2,448 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Lebanon since October 2023, according to Lebanese health authorities.

aj-logo The attacks on Saturday came a day after the group announced a new phase in the fighting.

Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for the Caesarea drone attack but said it carried out several rocket attacks on northern and central Israel.

Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said the drone attack would raise concerns among Israeli security authorities.

“The fact that a drone was able to go undetected 70km \[43 miles\] from the Lebanese border – no sirens went off, and it struck the intended target – that has caused a lot of concern in Israel and in the Israeli security establishment.”

She said “a large volley of rockets” from Lebanon were used as decoys to launch the drone attack on Netanyahu’s house."

While a drone attack did target Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Caesarea, Israel, on October 19, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence), [The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/drones-moans-and-groans-hezbollah-attacks-pms-home-petty-politics-continue-unintercepted/), and [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/live-updates-drone-strike-lebanon-netanyahu-gaza-rcna176216), Netanyahu and his wife were not present, and there were no injuries.

'You see us burning, you stay silent': Family’s agony over mother and sons burned to death in Gaza tent

Sha'aban al-Dalou - seen here in a selfie he took with members of his family - was killed when an Israeli strike set fire to his tent in central Gaza

_**Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and injury**_

There is no conscience. There is no humanity. There are only leaders who watch and do not act.

This is what Ahmed al-Dalou believes, as the images of his family burning replay in his mind. He says his life is gone. It died in the inferno of al-Aqsa compound with his boys and wife in the early hours of Monday 14 October.

In front of him on the ground is a shroud, wrapped around the body of Abdulrahman,12, his youngest son.

The child lingered in agony for four days after the fire, sparked by an Israeli strike. The day before he died Ahmed saw him in hospital and he was able to tell his father: “Don’t be worried, I am OK dad… I’m fine. Don’t be afraid.”

Ahmed is half speaking, half crying, as he talks of what has been taken from him.

“Three times I tried to pull him \[Abdulrahman\] out of the fire, but his body fell back into it.”

His older brother, Sha'aban, 19, and his mother, Alaa, 37, both died on the night of the fire.

Sha'aban became a new symbol of Gaza’s terrible suffering. Images of him writhing in agony as he burned to death in the family’s tent were shared around the world on social media.

There are burns all over Ahmed’s face and hands. The tone of his voice is high, a keening sound. Of the anonymous pilot who sent the missile, and the leaders who gave him orders, Ahmed said: “They broke my heart, and they broke my spirit… I wish the fire had burned me.”

The strike happened at about 01:15 local time last Monday (23:15 BST on Sunday).

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas "command and control" centre in the al-Aqsa hospital compound in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip.

Hamas denies operating in hospitals.

Ahmed al-Dalou survived the fire which burned through tents at the al-Aqsa complex - but suffered burns to his face and hands trying to rescue his family

Four people were killed immediately and dozens more wounded, including many with severe burn injuries. The Israel Defense Forces said it was “reviewing the incident”.

A spokesperson for the White House told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that footage of the fire was “deeply disturbing” and called on Israel to do more to protect civilians.

“Israel has a responsibility to do more to avoid civilian casualties - and what happened here is horrifying - even if Hamas was operating near the hospital in an attempt to use civilians as human shields.”

The US and other powers, including Britain, have expressed concern about civilian casualties since the early stages of the war.

Palestinians tried to battle the fire which tore through tents being used by displaced people

People are burned to death, blown to pieces, and shot every day in this war.

Most of the time the death agonies happen away from the cameras. It is the frantic search for survivors in the rubble, the dramatic scenes at hospitals, the endless stream of funerals, that are captured by cameras.

But the death of Sha'aban al-Dalou was different. His hand can be seen, reaching out of the inferno, a figure wrapped in flame, writhing and beyond the reach of any help.

In the days following his death Sha'aban’s own videos and photographs emerged. He was a typical teenager of his generation, aware of the power of social media, adept at recording his daily life.

The burning figure from the night of fire appeared to the world as an articulate, intelligent teenager, a software engineering student, a young man who took care of his family planning for a new life outside Gaza. He filmed himself donating blood and encouraged others to do the same.

“We saw so many injuries, many children are in dire need of blood… All we demand is for a ceasefire and this tragedy to end.”

We are only able to tell the story of al-Dalou family because of our own local journalist who went to meet the survivors. International journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.

*   [UN accuses Israel of war crimes over attacks on Gaza hospitals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2lnw2gvllxo)
    

In a video recorded in the tent where he died Sha'aban described how his family had been displaced five times since the war began a year ago. He had two sisters, and two younger brothers.

“We live in very hard circumstances,” he said. “We suffer from various things such as homelessness, limited food, and extremely limited medicine.”

In the background, as he speaks, there is the loud mechanical hum of an Israeli observation drone, a constant in the daily and nightly soundtrack of Gaza.

The surviving brother of Sha'aban and Abdulrahman, Mohammed al-Dalou, told the BBC that he had tried to go into the flames to rescue his older brother.

But other injured people had held him back, fearing he too would be killed. Mohammed did not sleep in the family tent, but outside on the street where he kept watch over their piled belongings.

“I was screaming for someone to let me go, but in vain… My brother’s leg was trapped and he couldn’t free himself. I think you saw it in the video. He was raising his hand.

"That was my brother. He was my support in this world.”

Sha'aban would come and wake him for prayers in the morning with a bottle of water and he would tell him: “I’ll work for you.”

! <image:2107>!Mohammed al-Dalou, aged about 17, is a smooth-faced young man in a t-shirt. He's pictured in front of wrecked buildings following the air strike on the al-Aqsa complex in the Gaza Strip.  <image:2115>

Mohammed al-Dalou saw his loved ones die in the fire

Mohammed recalled how the brothers set up a stall at the gates of the hospital selling food that the family made.

“We managed everything with our hard work. Everything we had was from our effort. We would get food and drink… then everything was lost.”

He saw the burned bodies, but could only identify his mother. Although her remains had been mutilated by fire, he recognised a distinctive bracelet.

“Without it, I wouldn’t have known she was my mother. Her hand was detached from her body, but the bracelet was still on it. I took it off her hand.”

This is his only memento of the woman who was “the kindness in our home".

The al-Dalou family is in shock. The survivors mourn the dead. Our BBC colleague asked Mohammed about the psychological cost of seeing his loved ones die.

“I can’t describe it. I can’t describe how I felt. I want to explain it to people, but I can’t. I can’t describe it. I saw my brother burning in front of me, and my mother too.”

Then, as if he is posing a question on behalf of the dead, he asks: “What more do you need, and you stay silent? You see us burning, and you stay silent.”

*   **Geoff Bennett:**
    
    Welcome to the "News Hour."
    
    A weekend of death and destruction gave way to another day of carnage in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israeli forces struck multiple sites in both places, killing dozens. Israel suffered its own losses as its troops in the north came under fire from Hezbollah.
    
*   **Amna Nawaz:**
    
    That drone attack killed four Israeli soldiers, but much focus fell again on Gaza and an Israeli attack outside a major hospital in Gaza's north.
    
    That is where Leila Molana-Allen begins our coverage tonight.
    
*   **And a warning:**
    
    Images and accounts in this story are disturbing.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Burned alive in a hospital bed, an I.V. that was supposed to heal became shackles. Last night, in Central Gaza's Deir al Balah, screams echoed through the night, as an Israeli airstrike hit a makeshift tent village outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, setting the tents and part of the building ablaze.
    
*   **Auoni Khattab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    There were people trapped inside the fire and we were unable to pull them out. A human being burned alive in front of your eyes, and you can't rescue him. He turned to ashes.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    At least four people were killed and dozens injured. Today, as the smoke cleared, doctors attempted to tend their burns without painkillers or ointments. Survivors sifted through the rubble of their temporary homes.
    
*   **Uhm Mahmoud Wadhi, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    Everything has burned, everything. As you see, I'm a mother of seven daughters. Where shall I go? My tent has collapsed, destroyed. All our clothes and belongings are gone. Who should we speak to? Where is the safety? We are calling on all countries, the whole world, to stand by our side and stop the war on us. We are exhausted. We have had enough.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Nearby, in Nuseirat, a night of horror for displaced families, as the IDF struck an UNRWA school where families were seeking shelter. The attack killed at least 22 people, including 15 children.
    
*   **Fatima Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    (through interpreter): They were sleeping unarmed. They're innocent. This is little Rahad's blanket here. She was only 2 years old. This morning, they removed their bodies, but the fire was still everywhere. Then there was another wave of airstrikes. The injured and dead were everywhere.
    
    We have had enough of this. Have mercy on us. They took their childhoods away. They took our smiles away. They have taken away every beautiful detail in our lives.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Fatima's son says all he wants is freedom from this war. He doesn't fear death anymore. He's seen too much.
    
*   **Abdullah Al Ajab, Displaced Gazan (through interpreter):**
    
    The fire was burning for three hours while we were carrying the dead and collecting their cut-off fingers, which we put in a box and took them to the hospital. The children here are dying. Everyone is going to die. We're not going to keep going from place to place. At least we will die in our country.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    In Israel last night, an IDF base south of Haifa was hit by a Hezbollah drone. The strike killed four soldiers and wounded dozens of others.
    
    Even as the United States sends a new missile defense system to Israel, Israelis worry their air defense can't handle the increasing threat from drones.
    
*   **Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Spokesperson, Israeli Defense Forces (through interpreter):**
    
    We are required to provide better protection. We will investigate this incident, learn and improve. Our mission is to better protect our soldiers and citizens of Israel.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As IDF troops push further across the border into south Lebanon, Israeli soldiers posted videos of themselves inside Lebanese homes.
    
    After multiple attacks on UNIFIL bases by Israeli troops left several U.N. peacekeepers wounded, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his demand that peacekeepers withdraw.
    
*   **Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Prime Minister (through interpreter):**
    
    It is time for you to remove UNIFIL from Hezbollah strongholds and from the fighting areas. The IDF has repeatedly asked for this and has been met with repeated refusals, all aimed at providing a human shield to Hezbollah terrorists. Your refusal to evacuate the UNIFIL soldiers makes them hostages of Hezbollah.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    The U.N. maintains they must stay under international law and that it's incumbent on Israeli and Lebanese forces to ensure their safety.
    
    The IDF demanded the evacuation of a further 20 towns and villages. Fully a third of the country is now under fire. Yesterday, a century-old souk and mosque in Nabatiyeh were razed to the ground; 2,300 people in Lebanon are now dead, nearly 11,000 injured.
    
    The IDF says it will tell Lebanese when they can return, but many of their homes and entire villages have been flattened and the bombing campaign is escalating across the country. In the past few days, Christian towns in the north have been targeted for the first time, while, in the capital, the strike zone continues to expand often without warning.
    
    Mohammad was left reeling after the streets housing his family home and his gym business in a calm central Beirut neighborhood were hit within five minutes of each other. The area had become home to dozens of displaced families who fled from the south. His family survived, but many in their building didn't.
    
*   **Mohammad Salamoun, Beirut Resident (through interpreter):**
    
    We're all families here, no weapons or Hezbollah leaders or anything. I don't know what they're thinking that they could kill us like this. When you see people dead in body parts all over the place, you don't know how to feel, especially after the terror we experienced after the strike.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    Some have decided they can't take it anymore. Nearly 100,000 Lebanese have fled to Syria, taking their chances with a stagnant civil war there over an escalating one here.
    
    After one airstrike too many, Widad and her teenage daughter left home with what they could carry.
    
*   **Widad Lakhal, Displaced From Lebanon (through interpreter):**
    
    My heart is in Lebanon. We will definitely return to Lebanon. I consider my country to be Lebanon, frankly, but fear. One can't trust Israel. It targets all the places.
    
*   **Leila Molana-Allen:**
    
    As the conflict spreads, this region is no longer boiling. It is burning.

**Iran launches major missile attack on Israel** **The Iranian airstrikes come in the wake of stepped-up Israeli military operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah, a group backed by Iran for decades. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

, killed in Iran's capital, Tehran, in July; and the earlier death of an Iranian military commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations [said in a statement](https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106)
 on the social media platform X that Iran carried out a "legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime." The statement added that "should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue."

Israel's government had warned the public that an attack was coming, and civilians took to bomb shelters nationwide before and during the strike. But the shooting remained at a relatively low level until Israel unleashed a much [larger campaign](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25348/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-hassan-nasrallah-timeline)
 two weeks ago.

Since then, Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people and have forced many Lebanese civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, [as well as many civilians](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5130756/israeli-airstrikes-leave-blast-sites-and-wounded-in-lebanons-bekaa-valley)
.

Back in April, an Israeli strike killed several leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, Syria.

Iran responded by [attacking Israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/14/1244693369/iran-israel-middle-east-what-to-know)
 with more than 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. **Maya Levin for NPR** ****hide caption****

Iran unleashed a major airstrike targeting sites across Israel on Tuesday night, while Israel's air defenses shot down most of the 180 incoming missiles, according to Israeli officials.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. destroyers fired a total of 12 interceptors at Iranian missiles as they headed to Israel. <image:2128>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon)

Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, October 1 \[Amir Cohen/Reuters\]

By [Al Jazeera Staff](/author/al_jazeera_staff_150119130629458)

Published On 1 Oct 20241 Oct 2024

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy.

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)

     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)
    .

> Western hypocrisy is not just outrageous, but extremely dangerous. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. “Let Netanyahu know that Iran does not seek war, but it stands firmly against any threat,” he wrote. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. It did not say what those consequences would be.
*   German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the country had warned Iran against “dangerous escalation”, which she said was “driving the region further to the brink of the abyss”.
*   UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned “the broadening of the Middle East conflict with escalation after escalation”."

**Iran Update, October 1, 2024**

**Information Cutoff: 2:00 pm ET**

_The Iran Update provides insights into Iranian and Iranian-sponsored activities abroad that undermine regional stability and threaten US forces and interests. We utterly condemn violations of the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions and crimes against humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports._

**Iran launched a two-wave ballistic missile attack that targeted Israel from Iranian territory on October 1.\[1\] Iran claimed to launch this attack in response to Israel’s killing of senior Axis of Resistance leaders including Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, and Hamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\[2\]** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles, including Emad and Ghadr ballistic missiles, from Iranian territory.\[3\] Iran claimed to launch its domestically produced hypersonic medium-range “Fattah-2” ballistic missile for the first time in the October 1 attack.\[4\] The IRGC claimed it launched Fattah missiles to destroy Israel's Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 anti-ballistic missile interception systems.\[5\] The IRGC conducted the October 1 operation with the approval of the Supreme National Security Council and “with the knowledge of” the Armed Forces General Staff.\[6\] Iranian Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasir Zadeh claimed that Iran targeted Israeli “military, operational and intelligence” centers associated with the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, which occurred in Tehran, Iran in July 2023.\[7\] Iranian Armed Forces General Staff-affiliated media claimed that Iran targeted the following airbases.\[8\]

*   The Nevatim Airbase, which houses Israeli F-35s, located outside of Beersheba, Israel.\[9\] Most of Israel’s F-35s were presumably airborne at the time of the attack, given that most of Israel’s aerial refuelers were airborne during the attack. Pro-Hezbollah media claimed this base was used in the Israeli killing of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.\[10\] Geolocated footage showed impacts to the base from missiles.\[11\]
*   The Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert.\[12\]
*   The Tel Nof Airbase 20 kilometers south of Tel Aviv.\[13\] Geolocated footage showed missiles impacting at or near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[14\]

Geolocated footage also showed Iranian ballistic missiles impacting in at least three other locations:

*   An area south of Herzliya, Israel.\[15\] The geolocated footage depicts an area located near the IDF Glilot Intelligence Base, which houses IDF Unit 8200, which is the IDF’s signals collection unit, and the Mossad Headquarters.\[16\] Israel evacuated the Glilot Intelligence base before the attack.\[17\]
*   A school in Gedera, Israel, located near the Tel Nof Airbase.\[20\]
*   An area near the Ayalon Mall, Ramat Gan, Israel.\[18\] Ayalon Mall is immediately west of Yarkon Park, where Shin Bet is headquartered.\[19\]

The Iranian attack killed one Palestinian near Jericho in the West Bank, and shrapnel lightly injured two Israelis in Tel Aviv.\[21\]

!

**Iran likely intended to inflict significant damage on Israel by oversaturating Israeli air defenses, particularly in central Israel.** Iran launched approximately 180 ballistic missiles targeting Israel on October 1, compared to the approximately 120 ballistic missiles it fired at Israel in April 2024.\[22\] The April attack focused on Israeli positions in northern and southern Israel, with several ballistic missiles striking Nevatim Airbase.\[23\] This attack focused on at least three possible targets between Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, and Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. The increase in ballistic missiles may have been designed to overwhelm the Israeli Arrow ballistic missile defense system by saturating it with large numbers of systems in relatively small and densely populated areas.  The large quantity of ballistic missiles also represents a significant Iranian investment that Iran is unlikely to willingly forfeit in an attack for show.

**The IDF reported that Israel and its allies intercepted the “majority” of the Iranian ballistic missiles launched at Israel.** IDF Spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari stated that the missiles impacted some areas in central and southern Israel, but that the IDF and the US-led defensive coalition intercepted the majority of projectiles.\[24\] United States National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan separately described the Iranian attack as “defeated and ineffective.”\[25\] An unspecified US defense official stated that US destroyers stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea helped intercept the Iranian ballistic missiles.\[26\]  The USS Arleigh Burke, USS Cole, and USS Bulkeley are currently deployed to the eastern Mediterranean region.\[27\] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claimed that 90 percent of the missiles hit their intended targets without providing any evidence for these claims.\[28\]  

**Israel vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1 attack.** Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated at the beginning of the Israeli cabinet meeting that Iran “made a big mistake and will pay.”\[29\] Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would attack anyone who attacks them. IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari stated that Israel’s operational plans are ready and vowed that Israel will respond ”wherever, whenever, and however we choose.”\[30\] Israel previously conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting an Artesh Air Force base in Esfahan, Iran, on April 18 in response to Iran’s April 13 drone and missile attack targeting Israel.\[31\] The IRGC warned on October 1 that it would conduct further attacks on Israel if Israel retaliates against Iran for its ballistic missile attack.\[32\]

**The IDF began the initial phase of its ground operation in southern Lebanon.** The IDF 98th Division began a “focused activity” on October 1 in what the IDF described would be a “targeted and delimited” operation in southern Lebanon.\[33\] The IDF said that a special operations brigade, a paratrooper brigade, and an armored brigade subordinate to the 98th Division have been preparing in recent weeks for the ground operation.\[34\] These units previously fought under the 98th Division for months in the Gaza Strip. The IDF’s cross-border operations, often led by the Egoz Unit, sometimes lasted multiple days and focused on destroying infrastructure belonging to Radwan forces located close to Israel.\[53\] The Egoz Unit was originally established in the 1990s as a raiding force specifically trained for operations in Lebanon against Hezbollah.\[54\] Unspecified Israeli officials said that the IDF’s current ground incursion into southern Lebanon will be ”an extension of the previous” raids with more units deployed to destroy infrastructure that smaller special forces could not.\[55\]

Hezbollah began its cross-border firing campaign in support of Palestinians in Gaza in October 2023. The IDF targeted and killed Hezbollah Unit 4400 commander Mohammad Jaafar Qasir in an airstrike in Beirut on October 1.\[59\] The IDF said that Unit 4400 is responsible for transferring weapons from Iran and its proxies to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\[60\] Qasir was a senior Hezbollah member who had been in his position for 15 years and was one of the ”most dominant” figures behind Iran’s ground line of communication through Syria to Hezbollah.\[61\] The IDF also killed the commander of the Syria-based Imam Hussein Division al Faqar Hinawi in Beirut on October 1.\[62\]  The IRGC formed the Imam Hussein Division in 2016.\[63\] The IDF said that the Imam Hussein Division had moved its headquarters to southern Lebanon since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and operates closely with Hezbollah’s southern command units.\[64\]

**The IDF Air Force likely struck multiple Syrian Arab Army (SAA) positions in southern Syria on October 1, possibly to suppress SAA air defenses.\[65\]** The IDF also struck multiple locations in eastern Daraa and western Suwayda on October 1.\[66\] Syrian sources reported that the IDF targeted and eliminated the radar systems of five Syrian Arab Army (SAA) battalions, including those located at the al Thaala and al Khalkhala military airports in western Suwaida.\[67\] A Syrian outlet noted that the number of systems targeted, and Israel’s use of drones differentiates these strikes from Israel’s previous attacks targeting radar systems in southern Syria.\[68\]

**The IDF has previously conducted airstrikes targeting SAA sites in southern Syria in response to SAA's cooperation with Lebanese Hezbollah.\[69\]** The IDF has repeatedly targeted sites in Quneitra and Daraa provinces that Hezbollah fighters use as reconnaissance and observation points to observe the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\[70\] The IDF likely struck SAA sites in Suwayda and Daraa provinces on October 1 due to ongoing SAA-Hezbollah cooperation and possibly to continue to disrupt Hezbollah’s ability to receive weapons from Syrian territory. Iraqi media reported that ”elements outside the law” launched three Katyusha rockets from al Amiriya in Baghdad toward the complex.\[85\] Possible Iranian-backed Iraqi militants recently attacked the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound near Baghdad International Airport on September 10.\[86\]

A security source separately told Al Jazeera on October 1 that unspecified militants conducted a rocket attack targeting US forces at Ain al Asad airbase in Anbar Province, Iraq.\[87\] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—denied responsibility for the attack.\[88\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have threatened in recent days to resume attacks targeting US forces if Israel launched a ground campaign into Lebanon.\[89\] Iranian state media claimed on October 1 that the United States has “officially entered” the war and that all US bases in the region are “legitimate targets” for the Axis of Resistance.\[90\] The Iraqi Resistance Coordination Committee, which is a coordinating body for Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, separately warned on October 1 that Iraqi militias will target “all US bases and interests” in the region if the United States attacks Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace to attack Iran in retaliation for the Iranian attack on Israel.\[91\]

!

**The Islamic Resistance in Iraq—a coalition of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias—claimed three Arqab cruise missile attacks targeting unspecified locations in Israel on October 1.\[92\]**

**Houthi Spokesperson Yahya Sarea claimed that the Houthis launched one drone at Tel Aviv and four “Sammad 4” drones targeting unspecified sites in Eilat, Israel, on October 1, before Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel.**\[93\] Israeli media did not acknowledge the attack."

Fire Shelters
=============

A wildland fire shelter is a portable tent-like covering firefighters can jump into during critical situations. When used correctly, it can significantly improve the chances of survival by protecting firefighters from heat and smoke. Remember that fire shelters are not a solution for continued contact with flames.

Before you head out, grab your LineGear fire shelter for maximum protection. Additionally, we have shelters that are award-winning for their safety and effectiveness, reusable (if used for training purposes), and include a carrying case, polyvinyl bag, case liner, and practice shelter.

Fire safety device in wildland firefighting

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Fire_shelter.jpg/250px-Fire_shelter.jpg)](/wiki/File:Fire_shelter.jpg)

US federal government-issue fire shelters in the deployed state

A **fire shelter** is a safety device of last resort used by [wildland firefighters](/wiki/Wildland_firefighter "Wildland firefighter")
 when trapped by [wildfires](/wiki/Wildfire "Wildfire")
. While such a shelter cannot withstand sustained contact with flames, it can protect a firefighter's life in a short-lived grass fire. Furthermore, it is designed to reflect [radiant heat](/wiki/Radiant_heat "Radiant heat")
, protect against [convective heat](/wiki/Convection "Convection")
, and trap breathable air — most firefighters' deaths are from inhaling hot gases — so that firefighters can survive in non-burning areas surrounded by intense fire for more than an hour.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

First required in the United States in 1977, fire shelters are constructed layers of [aluminum foil](/wiki/Aluminum_foil "Aluminum foil")
, woven [silica](/wiki/Silica "Silica")
, and [fiberglass](/wiki/Fiberglass "Fiberglass")
. The new-generation fire shelter was developed in 2002 to replace the old style fire shelter which is shaped like a pup-tent and has a carrying case. Its dimensions are smaller than that of the old-generation shelter,[\[2\]](#cite_note-2)
[\[3\]](#cite_note-3)
 now weighing approximately 4.4 pounds (2.0 kg).[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)

The first known use of a fire shelter was in 1804, when a boy was saved from a prairie fire when his mother covered him with a fresh bison hide. [William Clark](/wiki/William_Clark_(explorer) "William Clark (explorer)")
 noted in his journal that the fire did not burn the grass around the boy.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)
 In the United States fire shelters began being used by wildland firefighters during the late 1960s and have proven extremely effective. In more than 1,300 uses through 2022 only 41 deaths had occurred.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)

## Elaboration
The search results provide information about fire-related tents, including those used during wildfires and fire shelters for firefighters. However, this information does not help verify the claim. I still lack sufficient information to verify the claim.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search and web searches did not yield any results to verify the claim. The NPR article discusses Iranian strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024, but it does not contain the image in the claim. Therefore, I cannot verify the claim. `false`

CLAIM: An image shows a social media post by actor Mel Gibson about “the end” of Israel and the country’s desire to “destroy everything” in its way.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Gibson has not posted on social media about "the end" of Israel, as some users have falsely claimed. Gibson has not posted on social media about “the end” of Israel, as some users have falsely claimed. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

**Claim:**

An image shows a Facebook post from actor Mel Gibson that references Israel with the words, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

**Rating:**

[!Rating: Fake <image:11718>](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/fake/)

Rating: Fake

In mid-October 2023, amid ongoing developments in [the war in Israel and Gaza](https://www.snopes.com/tag/israel-hamas_war/)
, online users [shared](https://archive.ph/0nRbo)
 [an](https://archive.ph/BNbMJ)
 [image](https://archive.ph/dcwn4)
 of a purported Facebook post that claimed actor Mel Gibson had made a statement in support of Palestinians.

The supposed post included an image of an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass, as if to say that the country's time was running out. 7.

!Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel&#39;s time was coming to an end and that&#39;s why they&#39;re destroying everything in the way. <image:11719>

Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel's time was coming to an end and that's why they're destroying everything in the way.

However, the truth was that Gibson had no public-facing social media accounts. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

The post apparently referenced the fact that Israel had [continued to conduct airstrikes](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-b084e9c453cc99f7bec6f66d7b5913d9)
 in Gaza while at the same time preparing its military for a ground assault. Further, the first few words of the caption appeared to have been a poor translation to English by the person who created the post.

While it's true that Gibson had [expressed](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/LegalCenter/story?id=2557656&page=1)
 some anti-Semitic views in the past, the post in question was fake.

Mel Gibson's past controversies—including previous [racist, antisemitic and sexist comments](https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-anti-semitism-racism-accusations-1512808)
—have risen to the fore again amid the consequences Susan Sarandon and Melissa Barrera have faced for their pro-Palestinian posts.

As the Israel-Hamas conflict rages, a number of celebrities have garnered mixed reactions from the public no matter what stance they publicly take. Steve Granitz/FilmMagic

Meanwhile, [Barrera was dropped from _Scream 7_](https://www.newsweek.com/melissa-barrera-scream-firing-sparks-fears-over-new-hollywood-blacklist-1845901)
 after she shared a host of pro-Palestinian posts, including an article that accused Israel of committing "genocide" through its strikes on Gaza.

The article—written for progressive Jewish magazine _Currents_ by Raz Segal, associate professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University—described the assault on Gaza as "a [textbook case of genocide](https://www.newsweek.com/holocaust-historian-israel-committing-genocide-raz-segal-1835346)
 unfolding in front of our eyes."

When contacted by _Newsweek_, a spokesperson for production company Spyglass Media Group highlighted a statement shared with _Variety_ that read: "Spyglass' stance is unequivocally clear: We have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech."

However, a number of social media users have pointed out that while these screen stars have faced losses for their comments, Gibson has continued to work in the years since he infamously told a police officer in 2006 that "Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

_Newsweek_ has contacted a representative of Gibson via email for comment.

"Very brave of Hollywood to go after several, seemingly dispensable, female actors for expressions of Palestinian solidarity while simultaneously rehabilitating Mel Gibson—an actual anti-Semite," said one detractor on X, formerly [Twitter](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter)

Newsweek AI is in beta. "Mel Gibson can still walk down a street in Hollywood without getting jumped."

Amid the criticism, a scattering of social media users spoke out in Gibson's defense, with one writing: "Mel Gibson's 'incident' happened nearly 20 years ago and cost him an awful lot."

Gibson has continued a slow walk back to Hollywood over the past decade following a number of controversies that involved racist, antisemitic and sexist comments, which have marred his career since the mid-2000s.

He made a number of headlines for offensive remarks over the past 16 years—perhaps most infamously, one made to a police officer in 2006 that "Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

While he has secured a number of roles since then, including critically acclaimed ones leading to an [Oscar nomination for his 2016 film _Hacksaw Ridge_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/awards/)
, he appeared to struggle to wipe the slate clean entirely; news in 2021 that he would direct an upcoming [_Lethal Weapon_ movie was met with lingering criticism](https://www.newsweek.com/joshua-malina-calls-hollywood-cancel-jew-hater-mel-gibson-antisemitism-1656303)
.

In 2006, Gibson apologized to a Los Angeles police officer who claimed the actor had shouted abuse at him during an arrest, including a claim that "the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world."

He later issued an apology asking Jewish people for forgiveness.

"There is no excuse, nor should there be any tolerance, for anyone who thinks or expresses any kind of anti-Semitic remark," Gibson said in a statement per the _New York Times_.

He continued, in part: "I want to apologize specifically to everyone in the Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words that I said to a law enforcement officer the night I was arrested on a D.U.I. United Talent Agency confirmed to _Newsweek_ it had cut ties with Sarandon.

"There are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country," Sarandon was quoted as saying.

In apparent reference to Gibson's role in the [Peacock](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/peacock)
 miniseries _The Continental: From the World of John Wick_, another wrote: "Firing Melissa Barrera for acknowledging a genocide in a year where Mel Gibson was allowed to lead a big budget tv show is some straight up f\*\*\*\*\*\* bulls\*\*\*."

"Meanwhile we have an award winning actor/director who has actually said antisemitic, anti-Black and misogynist things and he is STILL getting the bag," a different commenter said of Gibson. "Funny how that works."

[A different person wrote](https://twitter.com/benyahr/status/1727158430438469876)
: "I love that everyone is getting fired because Hollywood 'has no room for antisemitism' and also Mel Gibson still stars in movies and tv shows."

"Susan Sarandon could have chosen her words more carefully but let's not act like her being dropped came out of genuine concern for antisemitism" another stated. I guess as who I am, I'm not allowed to have a nervous breakdown, ever."

In June 2020, Winona Ryder told _The Sunday Times_ that Gibson asked if she was an "oven dodger," in apparent reference to the Holocaust.

Ryder, who identifies as Jewish, alleged: "We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends, and Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we're all talking and he said to my friend, who's gay, 'Oh wait, am I gonna get AIDS?' And then something came up about Jews, and he said, 'You're not an oven dodger, are you?'"

The _Stranger Things_ star added that Gibson "tried" to apologize at a later date.

Israeli airstrikes have devastated southern Lebanon, and Hezbollah has launched hundreds of missiles into Israeli territory. However, some viral images claiming to show the aftermath are fakeImage: Gil Nechushtan/AP Photo/picture alliance

Advertisement

Since the past weekend, Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in the [most intense exchange of fire](/en/middle-east-idf-prepares-for-possibility-of-lebanon-entry/live-70318800)
 one year into the Israel-Hamas war in [Gaza](/en/gaza/t-19074241)
. The armed wing of the Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group, which is considered a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, fired projectiles deeper into Israeli territory than ever before.

On Saturday, Israel launched waves of strikes against Hezbollah targets, describing the action as preemptive to thwart a planned attack. Hezbollah, in turn, fired a barrage of rockets and other projectiles at Israel, claiming it was in retaliation for Israeli strikes in [Lebanon](/en/lebanon/t-19131661)
.

Lebanon's Health Ministry reported at least 569 people killed, including 50 children, and more than 1,800 wounded since Monday.

The recent escalation between [Israel](/en/israel/t-19067044)
 and [Hezbollah](/en/hezbollah/t-41508807)
 has also fueled a surge of misleading content. A recurrent theme in social media posts involves manipulated visuals claiming to show Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. Often out of context or entirely unrelated, these videos have gone viral on social media platforms. [DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 investigated some of these viral claims.

Does this image show the aftermath of a Hezbollah attack on Ramat David airbase?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Despite Israel's hermetic military censorship. A photograph was leaked of the Ramat David base, which was attacked by Hezbollah at dawn today. Israel does not acknowledge that anything has happened at this air base,_" reads [the caption of a viral image](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — the caption of a viral image")
 circulating on social media. The image shows a large aircraft engulfed in flames, surrounded by vehicles at an airport, with military trucks and personnel scattered in the scene.

The Hezbollah attack targeted the Ramat David airbase near Haifa on Sunday, but this picture is fakeImage: Reddit

The image has been shared across multiple platforms, including  [X](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/OH9Ef "External link — X")
 (formerly Twitter), [Reddit](https://archive.is/uwdRN "External link — Reddit")
, and [Threads](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/wjvSK "External link — Threads")
, reaching users in several languages, including Arabic.

**DW Fact check:** Fake.

Israeli media have [reported](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-821267 "External link — reported")
 on the attack at Ramat David airbase in the North of the country, which occurred on Sunday morning. However, there are clear indications that the image being shared is AI-generated.

One of the most prominent signs of this being AI-generated content is the blurry and indecipherable text. The vehicle in the middle, closer to the camera, shows what appears to be writing on its side, but the text is distorted and unreadable. Some characters resemble Hebrew letters, but others don't make any sense. This is a common AI flaw, known as a "hallucination," which occurs when the system creates elements that don't exist or don't make sense in the real world.

Some details in the image are distorted, unrealistic or blurred which are indicators of it being AI-generatedImage: Reddit

The image also shows multiple visual distortions, particularly in the shapes and outlines of objects. The truck in the foreground has an awkward curve in its loading section. The vehicles closest to the plane seem fused, with their outlines merging unnaturally, making them difficult to distinguish. Most military vehicles in the image look unrealistic. Such errors are typical in AI-generated images.

Also, the aircraft's wing appears misaligned, and its body has an odd bump. Even more telling is the unrealistic clarity of the flames in the image, which contrasts with the somewhat blurry and distorted vehicles and other surrounding details.

The inconsistencies strongly indicate that the image is AI-generated rather than an authentic photograph of a real attack on the Ramat David airbase.

DW Fact check conducted an analysis using Truemedia, a nonprofit tool specialized in detecting political deepfakes on social media. The tool's digital analysis uncovered substantial signs of manipulation, which the platform later corroborated by human experts.

Footage of fireworks in Algeria and fire in Indonesia claimed to show Israel under attack
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** A viral [post](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/x9SDs "External link — post")
 shared on September 22 reads, "_Hezbollah turned Israel to Isra-Hell_," accompanied by a minute-long video. The video is a compilation of several unrelated clips, with sounds of gunfire, sirens, and screaming added throughout the video to create a sense of continuity. The first few seconds show glowing lights illuminating the night sky in a public space, while the second part depicts scenes of chaos, with areas engulfed in flames at night.

The post has been widely circulated in multiple languages, including [English](https://archive.is/gvqGS "External link — English")
, [Arabic](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/bxOb7 "External link — Arabic")
, [Urdu](https://archive.ph/omoFJ "External link — Urdu")
 and [Hindi,](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/Amha5 "External link — Hindi,")
all suggesting the video shows the aftermath of a Hezbollah missile attack on Israel.

A quick search of a screenshot from the video reveals it is old and unrelated to the current tensions. In many cases, fake videos and misinformation can be debunked through a reverse image search.Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the first part of the clip reveals that the video is not from the recent conflict. It originates from Algeria and shows the [celebrations of the 103rd anniversary](https://archive.is/B6E0I "External link — celebrations of the 103rd anniversary")
 of the Mouloud d'Alger soccer club — not military action.

There are [more videos](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/vFs3bALRF1 "External link — more videos")
 of the same event online, which show the police officers in uniforms labeled "G.I.P," consistent with those of [Algerian law enforcement.](https://archive.ph/VtzUB "External link — Algerian law enforcement.")
 And these celebrations took place at the beginning of August.

The same applies to other parts of the clips. They are also unrelated to the current conflict between Hezbollah and Israel and have been circulating for at least two years, [previously claiming](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/rD9EW "External link — previously claiming")
 to [show a fire](https://ghostarchive.org/archive/06ytm "External link — show a fire")
 in an Indonesian rural area. 

DW could not verify the exact locations where the videos were filmed. However, the fact that the clips are at least two years old confirms they have no connection to the ongoing hostilities. 

Some clips have been mirrored from original versions, making reverse image searches more difficult and complicating efforts to track down the original sources of the images.

We were unable to track down prior publications for one segment of the clip. 

Footage of Russian oil refinery attack misrepresented as Hezbollah drone strike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Claim:** "_Hezbollah drones reached the oil refineries in the north of occupied Palestine_," claims a [post on X](https://archive.ph/qP3YN "External link — post on X")
. Hezbollah and other anti-Israeli groups refer to Israel as "occupied Palestine" because they do not recognize it as a legitimate country. Attached to the post is a video purportedly showing a drone flying over an industrial site, striking part of the facility, and exploding. The footage has been shared by numerous accounts on X with similar claims.

This footage has been verified to show a Ukrainian drone strike on a Russian oil refinery in July 2024Image: X

**DW Fact check:** False.

A reverse image search of a screenshot from the video reveals it dates back to the end of July. The footage actually shows a [Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a5NSXybWbWk "External link — Ukrainian drone attack on an oil refinery in Tuapse")
, located in the Krasnodar region of Russia, approximately two months ago.

This is a view of the oil refinery in Tuapse in 2020, with storage tanks and a valley shape matching the location seen in the video.Image: Igor Onuchin/TASS/imago

Hezbollah [has claimed](https://archive.ph/r9iC5 "External link — has claimed")
 it targeted several Israeli military installations on Tuesday, including an explosives factory 60 kilometers (37 miles) into Israel. 

The militant group also reportedly launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. While the Israeli military intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, there were no reports of casualties or damage. This marked the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

However, many images circulating online that claim to show the aftermath of these attacks are fake.

Brennende fly, enorme missilangrep og menn uten kjønnsorganer.

Helt siden Hamas-terrorister kjørte over grensen til Israel 7. oktober 2023, har sosiale medier vært fylt med grufulle videoer og bilder fra krigen i Midtøsten.

De dagene krigen er på sitt mest intense, kan mengden av bilder være overveldende, og mengden feilinformasjon som deles har også vokst siden krigsutbruddet.

Konflikten har fått et eget digitalt liv, hvor mange av deltakerne ikke lenger ser ut til å være interessert i å etablere en presis forståelse av hva som skjer. I stedet angriper de bare hverandres synspunkter på nettet.

Og det er nå nesten umulig å fastslå hva som er sant og usant hvis du kun får informasjonen din fra medier som X, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram og Facebook.

Hvordan oppdage falskt innhold?
-------------------------------

Hvis du stiller deg selv de riktige spørsmålene, er det mindre sannsynlig at du blir et offer for manipulerte bilder og historier.

Hvem er kilden?

Undersøk hvem avsenderen er. Se hva annet kilden deler, og sjekk om vedkommende vil stå ved informasjonen med navn og ansikt.

Hvorfor ble materialet delt?

Manipulert materiale er ofte designet for å skape en følelsesmessig respons og for å spille på folks fordommer.

Er det tegn på AI?

Bilder generert av kunstig intelligens kan fortsatt ofte avsløres ved å zoome inn på detaljer. Noen ganger mangler detaljer som fingre og tær, eller det er for mange.

Stemmer datoen?

Ser du egentlig på et gammelt innlegg? Sjekk om været, årstid og tid på døgnet stemmer overens med hendelsen som avsender sier bildet er fra.

Hvem delte den først?

Bruk et bildesøkeprogram som Google Lens for å finne ut om andre også deler bildet og i hvilken sammenheng det deles.

Nedenfor har vi samlet fem eksempler på noen av de manipulerte historiene og videoopptakene, der sannheten igjen og igjen blir et av krigens mest involverte ofre.

Skadene til Hizbollah-folket
----------------------------

  ![FEIL: En rekke pro-israelske profiler på X delte disse bildene kort tid etter angrepet. Foto: X / @hamasatrocities](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063502.webp?imageId=17063502&x=1.71&y=1.63&cropw=96.00&croph=95.71&width=675&height=669 "Foto: X / @hamasatrocities")

Da Israel startet sin aksjon mot Hizbollah-militsen i Libanon 17. september 2024, skjedde det med et angrep der militsmennenes personsøkere plutselig eksploderte.

Angrepet drepte 12 mennesker og skadet over 2700, og det tok ikke lang tid før sosiale medier ble fylt med bilder av ofrene og restene av de eksploderte personsøkerne.

Noen av bildene viste til og med – ifølge avsenderne – at flere mannlige Hizbollah-medlemmer mistet kjønnsorganene under eksplosjonene.

  ![FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063525.webp?imageId=17063525&width=978&height=551 "Foto: X / @israelifihther")

FEIL: Ifølge en israelsk soldat som kaller seg Daniel Hanukha på X, er dette skader forårsaket under personsøkerangrepet. Foto: X / @israelifihther

Bildene, som er vannmerket på arabisk, ble delt blant annet av den proisraelske profilen [Hamas Atrocities](https://x.com/HamasAtrocities/status/1837121304517898265)
 med teksten «konsekvenser».

De ble delt av flere israelske soldater, som profilen [Daniel Hanukha](https://x.com/israelifihther/status/1837535641690595627)
, som skrev:

– Israels siste offensiv mot Hizbollah påførte ikke bare fysisk skade, men er også et alvorlig slag for moralen og organisasjonens operative evne. Angrepet etterlot 5000 sårede og 500 i kritisk tilstand, hvorav mange sannsynligvis ikke vil overleve.

Tallene i innlegget er ikke den eneste overdrivelsen.

For ingen av de tre underkroppene på bildene har faktisk noe med personsøkerangrepet å gjøre.

Og hvis du søker etter fotografiene ved hjelp av Google Lens bildesøk, kan du enkelt finne to av dem.

En av dem har allerede blitt delt vidt og bredt i en helt annen sammenheng.

Bildet, der penis tydelig er borte, stammer faktisk fra den 65 år gamle ikke-binære amerikanske arkitekten [Lewin Wertheimer](https://x.com/lewinmodified_)
.

Han gjennomgikk en operasjon i april hvor penis ble fjernet og erstattet med en kunstig vagina, og etter operasjonen delte han stolt bildet på X, mens han holdt de fjernede testiklene i hendene.

  ![KJØNNSSKIFTE: Lewin Wartheimers innlegg på X 10. april 2024, hvor han nettopp har blitt operert. Foto: X / @lewinmodified](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063551.webp?imageId=17063551&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=675 "Foto: X / @lewinmodified")

Bilde nummer to har heller ingenting med konflikten i Midtøsten å gjøre.  

Bildet av den bandasjerte penisen kommer faktisk fra en japansk profil på [X.](https://x.com/ayanetyaaaaaan/status/1189503012714057729)

Her skriver profilens eier, Ayane, i et innlegg fra 30. oktober 2019 at han hadde en ulykke med en kopp ramennudler og måtte til legen.

  ![SKADE: Innlegget med ramennudlene er fra 2019 og er illustrert av dette bildet. Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063620.webp?imageId=17063620&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=912 "Foto: X / @ayanetyaaaaaan")

I den tredje underkroppen krever det litt mer innsats for å finne ut hvem personen er.

Et bildesøk gir bare et litt større utsnitt av det samme bildet, og her kan du se en mann som mangler både bein og høyre øye.

Hvis du oversetter den arabiske teksten på det større bildet, ser det ut til at mannen sannsynligvis heter Raja Awida.

Et søk på navnet hans fører til flere artikler i palestinske medier hvor man kan [se bilder](https://english.palinfo.com/Zionist-Terrorism/2024/09/13/325293/)
 av samme mann som mangler høyre øye og begge beina.

  ![FRA GAZA: Foto: Det fremgår av den arabiske teksten at bildet deles for å samle inn penger til en mann Raja Awida.

Og så kan du lese at han er offer for et israelsk bombeangrep i Gaza og derfor ikke offer for personsøkerangrepet.

Bildene av de påståtte skadene er et godt eksempel på at materiale er tatt ut av kontekst og misbrukt til å fortelle en helt annen historie.

En veldig stor del av de manipulerte historiene som vi i TV 2 Danmark har vært borti på sosiale medier det siste året er av den typen.

Men også kunstig intelligens begynner å bli involvert.

Den ødelagte basen
------------------

  ![KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063718.webp?imageId=17063718&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=743 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

KI-BILDE: Bildet her ble delt 23. september 2024, etter at Hizbollah utførte et rakettangrep mot Israel. Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

22\. september 2024 ble Israel utsatt for et stort rakettangrep fra Hizbollah.

Like etterpå gikk bildet ovenfor viralt som «dokumentasjon» på at rakettene hadde forårsaket store skader på militærbasen Ramat David i den nordlige delen av landet.

Bildet ble delt av de propalestinske profilene på X [SilencedSirs](https://x.com/SilentlySirs/status/1837936858652725379)
 og [Dr. Sam Youssef](https://mobile.x.com/drhossamsamy65/status/1838022636841979974)
, og i skrivende stund er den sett over 500.000 ganger.

– Bilde fra Ramat David-basen i det okkuperte Palestina, etter at basen ble rammet av Hizbollahs angrep, skriver SilencedSirs i den medfølgende teksten til innlegget.

Ifølge Dr. Sam Youssef sier bildet ble lekket gjennom israelsk sensur, og ifølge ham beviser det at det er omfattende skader på basen.

Men hva beviser egentlig bildet?

Zoomer du inn, er det flere mistenkelige ting ved motivet.

Flyet har en mystisk pukkel nær haleroret, lastebilen til venstre har en enorm dør, og bilen nederst har to frontender.  

  ![FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063728.webp?imageId=17063728&x=0.00&y=0.00&cropw=100.00&croph=100.00&width=675&height=783 "Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65")

FEIL: Bildet er fullt av tegn på at det ble generert av kunstig intelligens. X / @drhossamsamy65 Foto: X / @drhossamsamy65

Samtidig er det brennende flyet av en type som ikke eksisterer i virkeligheten, og det ser ut til å være satt sammen av et Hercules-fly og en Boeing 707.

Hvis du blar raskt forbi det falske bildet, kan det være vanskelig å se at det er fabrikkert, og de som ser det uten å ha mistanke om det, kan tro at Israel ble hardt rammet av angrepet fra Hizbollah, selv om bildet ikke dokumenterer noe i den retningen.

Bildet av det brennende flyet tilhører de mer sofistikerte AI-genererte bildene fra konflikten i Midtøsten.

Det brukes ofte mer upraktiske løsninger, hvor gamle bilder er forkledd som nye, eller hvor bildene kommer fra helt andre steder.

Dataspill fra Iran
------------------

  ![SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063730.webp?imageId=17063730&x=0.57&y=0.26&cropw=96.00&croph=95.97&width=675&height=905 "Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK")

SPILL: Ifølge flere pro-iranske kilder på sosiale medier så oppskytingen av de mange missilene slik ut. Foto: Focus Home Interactive / TV 2 DK

Israel ble utsatt for et stort luftangrep fra Iran om kvelden 1. oktober, med rundt 200 missiler som utfordret det israelske luftforsvaret, slik at flere av de iranske våpnene kunne slippe gjennom og treffe målene sine.

Under og etter angrepet ble det delt mange spektakulære bilder av missiler på himmelen over Israel – men hvordan så det ut da de ble skutt opp?

Det er spørsmålet den propalestinske X-profilen [Zainabzehra](https://mobile.x.com/ZAINABALI_72/status/1841182994595565706)
 prøvde å svare på til følgerne sine.

Profilen publiserte en video som i skrivende stund er sett 5,4 millioner ganger, og der den tilhørende teksten lyder:

– Iransk stats-TV har nettopp vist dette.

På bildene kan du se hundrevis av mobile utskytningsramper som sender ut så mange missiler at de nesten dekker himmelen.

Men zoomer man inn på de mobile rampene, viser det seg at det er gamle jugoslaviske kjøretøy, som i dag kun brukes av Bosnia, Serbia og Kroatia.

  ! <image:2151>

Hvordan havnet de i Iran?

Det har de ikke.

For når man ser nærmere på bilene, viser det seg at de ikke er ekte.

Bildene kommer faktisk fra dataspillet [Wargame: Red Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame:_Red_Dragon)
, utgitt av Focus Home Interactive i 2014.

En moské i brann
----------------

Noen av de fabrikkerte videoene og bildene som florerer på sosiale medier, deles ikke nødvendigvis for å lure folk, selv om de ser naturtro ut ved første øyekast.

13\. august [delte](https://x.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)
 for eksempel den høyreekstreme israelske gruppen Sons of the Temple Mount en video som viser den muslimske helligdommen Al Aqsa-moskeen i flammer.

[https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312](https://twitter.com/TheTempleMoun/status/1823370869021831312)

– Absolutt seier, heter det i den tilhørende teksten.

Heldigvis er det et [webkamera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niaaMHL3Mak)
 som peker direkte mot Al Aqsa-moskeen, så det er ganske enkelt å forsikre seg om at helligdommen fortsatt er der.  

Men intensjonen med den naturtro videoen, som ble laget med kunstig intelligens, var nok også annet enn å spre falske nyheter.

Nemlig å provosere.

Videoen har i skrivende stund kun blitt vist noen hundre ganger på gruppens egen profil på X, men til gjengjeld ble den raskt plukket opp av et stort antall palestinske profiler som raser mot den jødiske trusselen.

Videoen har blitt sett rundt 100.000 ganger på propalestinske profiler som [Eye on Palestine](https://x.com/EyeonPalestine/status/1834146323953574201)
, [DOA Muslims](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1834198658570449027)
 samt den antisionistiske kanalen [Torah Judaism](https://x.com/TorahJudaism/status/1834245765624938637)
.

Og hvis formålet med videoen var å provosere, lyktes det.

For 15. september kunne den israelske avisen [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-09-15/ty-article/.premium/hamas-warns-grave-consequences-after-jewish-extremists-threaten-al-aqsa-mosque-in-video/00000191-f5e0-d570-ab95-fdedbd340000)
 fortelle at den palestinske terrorbevegelsen Hamas advarte om «alvorlige konsekvenser» på grunn av videobildene av den brennende moskeen.  

De «digitale» skyene
--------------------

Ett år inn i krigen er mengden manipulert informasjon i konflikten så alvorlig at selv relativt ubetydelig informasjon nå møtes med mistillit.

For eksempel etter Irans missilangrep mot Israel 1. oktober.

Her har israelerne i ettertid holdt informasjonen om hva iranerne traff tett inntil brystet.

Så langt har ikke Israels militære publisert noen bilder av mål som er truffet, og pressen har ikke tilgang til de berørte basene.

Derfor ventet lenestolekspertene på internett, som følger krigen tett, lenge på at det skulle komme nye satellittbilder etter angrepene.

Men da de kom, var det en skuffelse.

[Den anonyme X-profilen Ayden](https://x.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)
 publiserte 2. oktober et satellittbilde av en av de israelske basene som var målet for det iranske angrepet, og her er det ikke mulig å se basen på grunn av skydekket.

[https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424](https://twitter.com/squatsons/status/1841548683566821424)

Ayden publiserer sin egen analyse av materiale fra konfliktområder til sine 149.000 følgere, og profilens eier konkluderte med at skyene var digitalt plassert slik at publikum ikke kan se ettervirkningene av angrepet.

I skrivende stund har den oppsiktsvekkende påstanden blitt sett 1,7 millioner ganger på Aydens profil alene.

Påstanden ble også umiddelbart plukket opp av en rekke propalestinske [profiler](https://x.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1841533871587836034)
 som den britiske journalisten Sulaiman Ahmed, som delte det som et faktum med sine 598.000 følgere på X.

– Breaking. Israel legger falske digitale skyer over Nevatim-basen. De vil ikke at du skal se skadene, skrev han.

Det er imidlertid ingen indikasjoner på at satellittbildene har blitt manipulert.

Det var spredt skydekke over store deler av Israel de dagene de ble tatt.

  ![SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK](https://www.cdn.tv2.no/images/17063801.webp?imageId=17063801&width=978&height=551 "Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK")

SKYDEKKE: Slik så det ut over Israel 1. oktober. Foto: Copernicus Sentinel data 2024 / TV 2 DK

På bildet med de «digitale skyene» kan man se en brå overgang mellom bakke- og skydekke, men dette er fordi bildet er en mosaikk bygd opp av bilder fra ulike satellittpasseringer til forskjellige tider.

Påstanden om at Israel utplasserte digitale skyer for å dekke over skadene varte ikke mer enn noen få dager, og det er nå offentlig tilgjengelige satellittbilder som viser skader og kratre i bakken ved den israelske basen.

Hezbollah has announced that it launched dozens of rockets at Israel’s Ramat David Airbase, east of Haifa, in response to a series of [Israeli attacks](/news/2024/9/19/lebanese-people-talk-about-fears-after-pager-and-walkie-talkie-explosions)
, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)

," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

Content: "Rambam hospital in Haifa would transfer patients to its underground, secure facility, the ministry said.

Israel’s civil defence agency ordered all schools in the north of the country to close.

The successive barrages of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah at the Israeli air force’s Ramat David airbase, located 31 miles (50km) from the Lebanon border, were the deepest strikes it has claimed since hostilities began.

The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, delivered a speech at the airbase on Wednesday, telling air force personnel that Israel’s war with Hezbollah had reached a “new phase”.

In July, Hezbollah released footage filmed by a drone over Haifa that highlighted Ramat David as part of an almost 10-minute long video marking military infrastructure in the densely populated city in northern Israel.

Israel strikes targets in Lebanon as Hezbollah launches deepest rocket attacks since start of Gaza war

Israeli military says its jets targeted hundreds of Hezbollah sites, while Hezbollah says it launched dozens of missiles at an airbase in northern Israel

The Israeli military says it has launched airstrikes on hundreds of targets in southern Lebanon, as [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched its deepest rocket attacks into Israel since the start of the Gaza war, prompting a UN official to warn of “imminent catastrophe” in the region.

Fighting reached its most intense yet overnight, with Israel launching a wave of attacks that it said targeted Hezbollah missile launchers across Lebanon’s south. “Anyone who uses that term either conveniently forgot history or doesn’t understand the current environment, and anyone who thinks ‘escalation’ and ‘limited’ are controllable constructs is delusional.”

On Sunday an Iraqi coalition of pro-Iran armed groups also claimed a drone attack on Israel.

“The fighters of the Islamic Resistance of Iraq targeted on Sunday morning a strategic location in the occupied territories using drones,” said the Iraqi coalition in a statement on Telegram, referring to Israel, adding it was carried out “in support of our people in Gaza”.

The IDF confirmed the attack and said it had intercepted “multiple suspicious aerial targets” coming from Iraq overnight.

----------- Israel’s military said the target was a Hamas base inside the school, without providing details or evidence.

However, the most recent attacks suggest a potential strategic pivot by the Israeli military away from its focus on Hamas in Gaza and towards targeting Hezbollah.

On 8 October, following the Hamas attacks on Israel, Hezbollah entered the conflict in support of the Palestinian militants, with an attack on northern Israel.

Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have managed to avoid an all-out war, engaging instead in a limited conflict of attrition. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck hundreds of Hezbollah targets. At least one person was killed and another injured in the strikes, the Lebanese ministry of health said.

Hezbollah responded with four rocket barrages early on Sunday morning and more than 140 rockets and drones fired into Israel’s Jezreel Valley.

Fresh clashes erupted early on Sunday, with the IDF saying hundreds of rockets had been fired into Israel from Lebanon, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa.

The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas”, pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said it had treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was slightly wounded near Haifa.

In a statement, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon warned the region risked disaster.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” special coordinator Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said on X.

As she wrote, the Israeli health ministry urged hospitals in northern Israel to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire. Israel is presumed to be behind the operation, though it has not officially claimed responsibility.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “In the last few days, we have inflicted on Hezbollah a sequence of blows that it did not imagine. If Hezbollah did not understand the message, I promise you - it will understand the message.”

He added: “No country can tolerate shooting at its residents, shooting at its cities - and we, the state of Israel, will not tolerate it either… We will do everything necessary to restore security.”

Israel has not visibly slowed its war in Gaza to focus on the north. On Saturday, its forces bombed a school-turned-shelter, killing at least 22 and injuring 30 others, mostly women and children, the Gaza health ministry said."

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The first memorials to the victims of the [September 11 attacks](/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks")
 in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of [webmasters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/webmaster "wikt:webmaster")
 posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
 Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.[\[2\]](#cite_note-Names-2)

The _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ was the first major physical memorial at the [World Trade Center site](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_site "World Trade Center site")
. A permanent memorial and museum, the [National September 11 Memorial & Museum](/wiki/National_September_11_Memorial_%26_Museum "National September 11 Memorial & Museum")
 at the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with 30-foot (9.1 m) waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was [Pier A](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Pier_A_Park "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
 in [Hoboken, New Jersey](/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey "Hoboken, New Jersey")
. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the _[Tribute in Light](/wiki/Tribute_in_Light "Tribute in Light")
_ first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called [Hoboken Island](/wiki/Landmarks_of_Hoboken,_New_Jersey#Hoboken_Island "Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey")
, was chosen in September 2004.

_[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
_, the monumental and world's largest cast [bronze sculpture](/wiki/Bronze_sculpture "Bronze sculpture")
 of modern times created by German artist [Fritz Koenig](/wiki/Fritz_Koenig "Fritz Koenig")
 stood between the twin towers on the [Austin J. Tobin](/wiki/Austin_J._Tobin "Austin J. Tobin")
 Plaza of the [World Trade Center](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973%E2%80%932001) "World Trade Center (1973–2001)")
 in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on [September 11, 2001](/wiki/September_11,_2001 "September 11, 2001")
. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as _The Sphere_, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate [9/11](/wiki/9/11 "9/11")
. Having become a major [tourist attraction](/wiki/Tourist_attraction "Tourist attraction")
, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017, by the [Port Authority](/wiki/Port_Authority_of_New_York_%26_New_Jersey "Port Authority of New York & New Jersey")
 at a permanent location in [Liberty Park](/wiki/Liberty_Park_(Manhattan) "Liberty Park (Manhattan)")

The [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
 was a temporary memorial at Ground Zero.

Soon after the attacks, temporary memorials were set up in New York and elsewhere.

*   On October 4, Reverend Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest, blessed the [World Trade Center cross](/wiki/World_Trade_Center_cross "World Trade Center cross")
    , two broken beams at the crash site which had formed a cross, and then had been welded together by iron-workers.
*   On October 13, the [North Charleston Coliseum](/wiki/North_Charleston_Coliseum "North Charleston Coliseum")
     raised a special banner featuring the retired number of [Mark Bavis](/wiki/Mark_Bavis "Mark Bavis")
    , who was on United Airlines Flight 175. Bavis had played for the ECHL's [South Carolina Stingrays](/wiki/South_Carolina_Stingrays "South Carolina Stingrays")
    , and his retired number hangs in a special corner, independently from the Stingrays' retired numbers (#14, #24) and awards banners (1997 and 2001 Kelly Cup Championships), with the years he played for the team (1994–96), the date of his death (September 11, 2001), and an American flag.
*   Also on October 13, The [September 11 Photo Project](/wiki/September_11_Photo_Project "September 11 Photo Project")
     was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled "The September 11 Photo Project" in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
*   On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture _[The Sphere](/wiki/The_Sphere "The Sphere")
    _, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in [Battery Park City](/wiki/Battery_Park_City "Battery Park City")
    .[\[3\]](#cite_note-Sphere-3)
    

#### In other countries

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: In other countries")\
\]

In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, [Nissoria](/wiki/Nissoria "Nissoria")
 was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled “Parco 11 Settembre”. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

*   According to [Radio Farda](/wiki/Radio_Farda "Radio Farda")
    's website, when the attacks' news was released, Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news on Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the [United States Department of State](/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State")
    , published a post on its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.[\[4\]](#cite_note-4)
     After the attacks, the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran condemned the attacks. [BBC](/wiki/BBC "BBC")
     and [_Time_ magazine](/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")
     published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens on their websites.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

Memorial at [Fort Bragg](/wiki/Fort_Bragg "Fort Bragg")
 in 2019, featuring over 7,000 boots, representing military service members killed since the September 11 attacks

The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a 30-foot (9.1 m) American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.[\[109\]](#cite_note-dnainfo.com-109)

The flag has made a number of appearances across the country, including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS _New York_ Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight "Persons of the Week."[\[110\]](#cite_note-110)

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It visited all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees each added stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag now resides at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.[\[111\]](#cite_note-111)

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for "learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future." The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor's POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)"To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001." (2)"To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered." (2)"To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: "This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them" The Flag of Heroes reads: " This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them."

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan's Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks.[\[114\]](#cite_note-114)
 The flags were also featured on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")
's _[Today](/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program) "Today (American TV program)")
_[\[115\]](#cite_note-115)
 and on [ABC](/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company")
 affiliate [WVEC](/wiki/WVEC "WVEC")
 in Norfolk, Virginia.[\[116\]](#cite_note-116)

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

Virtual memorials
-----------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Virtual memorials")\
\]

The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as _[Second Life](/wiki/Second_Life "Second Life")
_ has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:

*   Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life)[\[117\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-117)
     is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal:

> On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

*   World Trade Center Memorial (_Second Life_)[\[119\]](#cite_note-sl-wtcm-119)
     is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the [Vietnam Veterans Memorial](/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial "Vietnam Veterans Memorial")
    .

9/11 Memorial in Israel

[![9/11 memorial in Israel](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://www.israelpharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9-11-memorial.jpg)
We wanted to share something with you, something that is not widely known to many Americans (and not all Israeli’s either).  
In Israel we have a dedicated memorial to the terrorist attack of 9/11. Not only does it stand out poignantly on a hill in the middle of Israel, near Jerusalem, but the base is made out of 9/11 twin tower wreckage. It cost more than $2 million to make and was orchestrated by the Jewish National Fund (JNF).  
Unfortunately Israel knows how to build memorials and monuments. In this small country with so much turbulence, we know only too well the suffering of those who die needlessly in these terrorist attacks. This memorial is known simply as the “9/11 Memorial Plaza”.  
Here are some interesting facts about the 9/11 Memorial Plaza.

*   The memorial Plaza was completed in 2009 for $2 million, by the JNF.
*   It sits on 5 acres of hillside, 20 miles from the center of Jerusalem, not a small monument at all. It overlooks Jerusalem’s largest cemetery, Har HaMenuchot.
*   The memorial monument is in the shape of a 30-foot, bronze American flag that has been built in the shape of a flame to commemorate the flames of the Twin Towers.
*   The base is made out of melted twin tower wreckage.
*   Surrounding the main monument are plaques listing the names of all the people who died as a result of the attacks. Even though the memorial stands in Israel and only 5 Israel citizens died as a result of the attacks the memorial lists ALL the victims who perished. It is the only memorial outside the US which lists ALL of those who died in the attacks.

Times are turbulent and the entire Middle East is going through vast changes. Some say the relationship between the US and Israel is in trouble…… whatever happens, there will always be a special relationship between the US (in particular New York) and Israel.  
A powerful memorial… so the world never forgets.

You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image shows the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, which features a 30-foot bronze sculpture of a waving American flag transforming into a flame (<image:50>

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.63, 'Palestine': 0.26, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United States': 0.05, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Bangladesh': 0.0}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The reverse image search identifies the memorial and its location. The geolocation data further supports the location of the memorial in Israel.

The claim states that this memorial is the only one outside the US. However, the provided evidence does not confirm or deny this statement. Additional information would be needed to verify if there are other 9/11 memorials outside the US.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Barcelona’s move came a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognized a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel’s military operations in Gaza amid the war sparked by the Hamas terror group’s devastating attack on October 7, 2023.

Barcelona’s city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing alleged violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, called for an end to all official relations with Israel “until respect for international law” and the “basic rights of the Palestinian people” are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with the liberal coastal city of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organizer Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

“The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable,” Barcelona’s Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

In 2023, then-mayor Ada Colau took similar steps, which were later reversed when Collboni won local elections.

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain’s second-largest city — a top tourist destination and home to one of the world’s best-known football clubs — adds to a growing list of critics of Israel amid the devastating war in Gaza.

Gaza, other Palestinian cities to become Barcelona's symbolic 11th district

The concept builds on a 1995 precedent when Barcelona symbolically named Sarajevo its 11th district to show solidarity and support for the city's recovery after the Srebrenica genocide.

The initiative, starting with an initial budget of €1 million ($1.16 million), is scheduled to begin at the end of the year and aims for a medium- and long-term horizon, including reconstruction efforts.

This week, Collboni also pledged to double UNRWA funding for food and medicine from €200,000 ($231,824) to €400,000 ($463,725), and said he would “stabilise and scale up” technical cooperation with cities like Gaza, Ramallah and Bethlehem through municipal staff, council structures and city resources.

Over the weekend, Collboni said he had planned to travel to Israel and Palestine, but Israeli authorities denied him entry.

August 27, 2025

Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni announced on Tuesday that Gaza and other Palestinian cities will symbolically become Barcelona’s 11th district to enhance cooperation and solidarity.

Collboni unveiled the plan during a visit to Jordan, saying the new district would be a technical and budgetary entity within Barcelona’s municipal structure. It will complement the city’s 10 existing districts and coordinate all cooperation projects with Palestinian cities and UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.

“This is no longer a one-off cooperation with visits, but a permanent structure, designed to utilise the talent of municipal technicians,” he said, adding that a similar structure could be created “in Palestinian territory or, if necessary, in Jordan”.

The concept follows a precedent set in 1995 when Barcelona symbolically designated Sarajevo as its 11th district to support its recovery after the Srebrenica genocide.

[! The objective was to know first-hand the reality of Palestinian cities and explore ways of aid from Barcelona at these critical moments,” he wrote on social media.

A [post](https://archive.ph/LKIoV)
 shared on Threads with an image purportedly of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s home, taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024, is MISSING CONTEXT.

The post reads, “BREAKING Netanyahu’s residence in Caesarea has been filmed by a drone belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah — Israel Hayom.”

The image was also shared on X (formerly Twitter) with similar claims in a [post](https://archive.ph/7EBDu)
 reading, “Netanyahu’s residence has been filmed by a Hezbollah drone…On target.”

According to media [reports](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/hezbollah-drone-suspected-of-filming-netanyahus-home-report/3307013)
, a suspected [Hezbollah](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah)
 drone that was purportedly filming Netanyahu’s home in Caesarea on 18 August 2024 was dismissed as a false alarm. The Lebanese militant group allied with [Hamas](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-hezbollah-houthis-iran-militant-groups-745bfc36e23997ee3f0bc499a9f5c16d)

 war in the Middle East.

A Google Lens reverse image [search](https://archive.ph/BOoER)
 established the image in question predates current events.

The image was featured in a 25 June 2020 [article](https://www.timesofisrael.com/why-exactly-have-israelis-been-ordered-to-pay-netanyahus-taxes/)
 by _Times of Israel_ with the headline, “Why, exactly, have Israelis been ordered to pay Netanyahu’s taxes?”

The image, labelled as a screenshot, is attributed to _Kan_ public broadcaster and captioned: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s private residence in Caesarea.”

_KAN_ featured the image in a YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/k_VMJvSd8v0)
 uploaded on 1 July 2019.

The video’s title, translated from Hebrew, reads, “The villa in Caesarea: The Netanyahu family insists that the state finance the sealing works.”

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:53>) is of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house. According to PesaCheck, the image dates back to 2019 and was featured in a Times of Israel article from June 25, 2020, and a YouTube video uploaded on July 1, 2019. The article is from PesaCheck and was published on August 28, 2024.

The Times of Israel published an article on October 21, 2024, discussing a drone explosion near Netanyahu's house in Caesarea. The image is also found on the website "Beyond Highbrow".

### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

## Elaboration
The image is of Benjamin Netanyahu's house. However, the image dates back to 2019, according to PesaCheck. The claim states that the image was taken in August 2024. Therefore, the claim is false.

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. However, the Israeli army has not completely ruled out the possibility of a small drone launched from Lebanon.

Netanyahu's office, in response to the report, stated that it was a "false alarm" and clarified that the Prime Minister was not at his Caesarea home at the time.

Hezbollah has previously released footage taken by its Hodhod drone showing Israeli military bases and critical infrastructure in northern Israel.

Fears have grown of a full-fledged war between Israel and Hezbollah amid an exchange of cross-border attacks especially after the July 30 assassination of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut.

The escalation comes against the backdrop of a deadly Israeli onslaught on Gaza, which has killed nearly 40,100 people since last October, since an attack by the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.

  

\*Writing by Ikram Kouachi

[Anadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form. 

Netanyahu and his family usually spend their weekends at their private residence in Caesarea, located 37 km south of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast.

According to Israel Hayom, a missile ship of the Israeli Navy stationed off the coast in Caesarea reported on Friday that a suspected drone was hovering in the area.

The newspaper speculated that the drone was launched by Hezbollah to capture footage of Netanyahu's home.

The drone was detected by the missile ship's radar, but it was not picked up by other control systems."

 on Saturday. ![The head of Hezbollah's media office, Mohammad Afif, gestures as he speaks during a press conference, in Ghobeiry, Lebanon October 22, 2024, in this still image from a video. His spokesperson said the prime minister was not in the vicinity at the time of the attack and there were no casualties.

Afif said that if in the previous attack Netanyahu was not hurt, “the coming days and nights and the \[battle\]fields are between us.” Afif appeared to be hinting that Hezbollah might carry out similar attempts in the future.

He also said there would be no negotiations with Israel while fighting continues and acknowledged that some Hezbollah fighters have been taken captive by the Israeli military.

“Israel does not adhere to the ethics of war, and we hold it responsible for the safety of our prisoners in its custody,” Afif said.

A [photo published on X](https://archive.is/0PvDl)
 (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister (PM) Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office is ALTERED.

The post alleges that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) captured and published the image, accompanied by a warning reading, “Do not test our capabilities — we intend to keep you living in a state of constant anxiety!”

However, a reverse image search revealed that the photo has [been online](https://archive.is/JmjZG)
 since 2019 and was not shared by IRGC in 2025, as the post claims.

Furthermore, a Yandex image search showed that the photo was [edited](https://www.malumatfurus.org/netanyahu-makam-odasi/)
 to make it appear as though Netanyahu was under surveillance. The [original image](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/in-this-handout-photo-benjamin-netanyahu-head-of-the-right-news-photo/84719768?adppopup=true)
, taken on 8 February 2009, in Jerusalem, shows Netanyahu with his father, Ben Zion Netanyahu.

A FotoForensics Error Level Analysis (ELA) reveals that the photo has been altered, as indicated by inconsistencies and noise in the image.

PesaCheck has looked into a photo on X (formerly Twitter) claiming to show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu being surveilled by Iran from inside his office and finds it to have been ALTERED.

TEHRAN – Ismail Haniyeh's son has brought attention to the possible involvement of WhatsApp in the assassination of the Hamas leader in Iran, noting that his father was communicating with family members through the American messaging app at least a few hours before his martyrdom. 

“My father regularly used WhatsApp to keep in touch with our family,” Abdul Salam Haniyeh said in an interview with Arab media. Ismail Haniyeh used WhatsApp just before assassination, son says
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Some {media outlets\] have been talking about a huge security gap \[in Iran\] or infiltration”

Technology conglomerate Meta, which owns WhatsApp, has been under fire for facilitating Israel’s propaganda campaign and crackdown on Palestinian voices protesting the regime’s ongoing genocide in Gaza for the past ten months. The Palestinian leader was targeted by a short-range missile whose warhead weighed 7 kilograms, according to a statement by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps. 

Some Western media outlets like the New York Times and the Telegraph have claimed to have talked to unidentified “sources” inside Iran, who told them that Haniyeh was killed by a bomb installed inside his room by IRGC members working for the Mossad. The claims have been refuted numerous times, and are seen as a way to make Iran’s potential military action against the regime unjustifiable. 

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has vowed to avenge Haniyeh’s blood."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building. <image:5685>

[**Iran Takes an Important Step: WhatsApp and Google Play Unblocked, Signaling Progress in Digital Access**](#1anchor)

=======================================================================================================================

**In a significant move toward increased internet freedom, Iranian officials and social media users confirmed the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play on Wednesday, December 25.** The decision, implemented following a directive from the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, aligns with President Masoud Pezeshkian’s campaign promise to reduce censorship and improve digital access for citizens.

**IRNA**, **Iran’s official news agency, announced that access to WhatsApp and Google Play is now unrestricted across all internet providers.** Many users on X confirmed that they could now use the services without a VPN, marking a major shift in digital accessibility. For Iranians, Afghans, Tajiks, Kurds, and others, the longest night is always followed by the promise of longer, brighter days – a sentiment that resonates deeply during these challenging times.

[**Israel Admits to Killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran**](#4anchor)

==================================================================

**On Monday, December 23, Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz publicly admitted Israel’s responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran.** This marks the first official acknowledgment by Israel of its involvement in the killing, which occurred earlier this year.

**Speaking on the matter, Katz declared, “In these times, as the terrorist organization Houthis launch missiles toward Israel, we intend to send them a clear message.”** He continued, “We defeated Hamas, Hezbollah, and blinded Iran’s defensive systems, damaging their missile production facilities.” Katz further warned, “What we did in Gaza, Lebanon, and Tehran, we will also do in Sanaa and Hodeidah, targeting the Houthis’ strategic infrastructure. Iravani emphasized, “This is the first time Israel has openly accepted its responsibility for this heinous crime.” He further described Katz’s statements as an “unprecedented escalation” and called on the international community to condemn Israel’s actions.

**Iranian officials also reiterated their commitment to seeking justice for Haniyeh’s assassination,** framing it as an attack on a prominent figure in the resistance against Israeli aggression and highlighting its implications for regional stability.

[**Ongoing Crackdown on Activists in Iran: Heavy Sentences and Repression**](#5anchor)

=======================================================================================

**The Iranian government continues its systematic repression of activists and dissenters, with harsh sentences handed down to prominent individuals in recent weeks.** These cases highlight the ongoing challenges faced by civil society and the harsh measures employed to silence voices advocating for human rights and freedom within Iran.

**Zeinab Zaman,** **a feminist activist, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined 500 million rials, and barred from social interactions with politically or socially active individuals for five years.** Her lawyer and brother, Abuzar Zaman, revealed that the charges were initially for “propaganda against the regime” but were later changed to “spreading false information.” Zeinab’s ordeal began on November 4, 2024, when she was summoned to the District 33 Public and Revolutionary Prosecutor’s Office in Tehran. The IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency later reported that Haniyeh had been targeted by a projectile while staying on the fourth floor of a building in the affluent district of Tehran.

**The Islamic Republic of Iran reacted strongly to Katz’s admission.** Iranian officials characterized the statements as a “brazen confession” and condemned the assassination as a “heinous crime.”

**Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s Ambassador to the United Nations, issued a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council on Tuesday, December 24, denouncing the attack**. However, proponents of the decision argue that these discussions are part of a broader effort to strike a balance between digital governance and public freedom.

**At this current juncture, the unblocking of WhatsApp and Google Play represents a meaningful stride in enhancing digital access in Iran.** It sets a hopeful precedent for further advancements in internet freedom that are still deeply needed in tandem with careful, inclusive policy-making. 

[**Iran and China: A Strategic Partnership and Challenges Ahead**](#2anchor)

=============================================================================

**Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has traveled to Beijing for high-level talks with Chinese officials.** Upon his arrival, Araghchi remarked to IRIB News that Iran’s nuclear file will require intensified consultations with China as the expiration of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) agreement approaches in October 2025.

**During his visit, Araghchi published an article in** **_People’s Daily_****, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, expressing optimism for a “new chapter” in Iran-China relations.** In his article, Araghchi emphasized the mutual stance of both nations against “unilateralism and hegemonic practices” and praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s foreign policy approach. Despite these efforts, the bravery and resilience of activists like Zeinab Zaman and Majid Tavakoli remain symbols of defiance in the face of repression.

[**Italian Journalist Cecilia Sala Detained in Tehran**](#6anchor)

===================================================================

**The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the detention of Cecilia Sala, a 29-year-old journalist, in Tehran.** Sala, known for her work with the Italian newspaper _Il Foglio_ and her popular podcast at Cora Media, was detained on December 19, 2024, during a reporting trip in Iran.

**According to the ministry’s statement on December 27, Sala was stopped and arrested by Iranian authorities while working on a series of stories.** She is currently held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, a facility notorious for housing political prisoners and journalists. They have called on the press to advocate for her freedom.

**Sala is not the first journalist to face detention in Iran for reporting.** Over the years, several foreign and dual-national reporters, including Roxana Saberi, Jason Rezaian, Roger Cooper, and Maziar Bahari, have been arrested, highlighting the precarious conditions for journalists in the country.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It must have been similar to the NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which infiltrated his mobile phone to provide Israeli intelligence a look into his private conversations and real-time location.

Pegasus is a digital spirit, infamous for its stealth, tyranny, and hacking feature which transforms smart phones into spies. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The Hamas leader did not realize that this simple notification was a declaration of the beginning of his death? In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that there are reports and suggestions, though not definitive proof, that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through his smartphone, possibly using WhatsApp. While there are reports of Haniyeh using WhatsApp before his assassination and the potential use of spyware, the claim lacks conclusive evidence to confirm it.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "For the assassination on July 31, 2024, Israeli intelligence tracked Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reports from [Tehran Times](https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/502689/Ismail-Haniyeh-used-WhatsApp-just-before-assassination-son-says) state that Ismail Haniyeh's son said his father used WhatsApp before his assassination. [IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/did-whatsapp-give-away-hamas-leader-s-location-336529/) mentions unconfirmed reports that spyware on Haniyeh's phone, possibly through WhatsApp, may have been used to track his location. The [NIAC](https://niacouncil.org/12-27-24/) reported that Israeli Defense Minister Yisrael Katz admitted Israel's responsibility for the assassination. <image:k>, <image:5685>, <image:5697>


### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from The Jerusalem Post, published on June 17, 2025, states that Iranian state media warned Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran <image:k>. Another article, "The Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh: Silent Digital Strikes?" published on August 4, 2024, by Noureen Akhtar, suggests that Israeli intelligence may have tracked Haniyeh through his smartphone using spyware, possibly accessing his private conversations and real-time location via WhatsApp.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Israeli intelligence may have tracked Ismail Haniyeh through his smartphone, potentially using spyware via WhatsApp. The Tehran Times reports that Haniyeh used WhatsApp before his assassination, and IntelliNews mentions unconfirmed reports of spyware being used to track his location. The Jerusalem Post and an article by Noureen Akhtar further support the possibility of tracking via smartphone and WhatsApp.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards confirmed the death of Haniyeh, who was the face of Hamas' international diplomacy as the war triggered by the Islamist group's attack on Israel on Oct. [Skip to main content](#main-content)

Palestinian group Hamas' top leader Ismail Haniyeh meets with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in Tehran, Iran, July 30, 2024. Media reports said he was referring specifically to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group that has ramped up since the outbreak of the Gaza war.

The prime minister of Qatar, which along with the United States and Egypt has acted as a mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, suggested that Haniyeh's killing could jeopardise efforts to secure a truce.

"Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue lead us to ask: How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?" Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani wrote on X.

Egypt's foreign ministry said Haniyeh's killing and the lack of progress in ceasefire talks complicated the situation.

The news - which came less than 24 hours after Israel claimed to have killed Hezbollah's top military commander whom it said was behind a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday - appears to set back any chances of an imminent ceasefire agreement in the Gaza war.

At the same time, the risk of a war between Israel and Hezbollah has grown since the attack in the Golan that killed 12 children in a Druze village, and the air strike meant to kill senior Hezbollah commander [Fuad Shukr](/world/middle-east/who-is-hezbollah-commander-targeted-by-israel-beirut-2024-07-30/)
.

Hezbollah said [Shukr had been in a building](/world/middle-east/hezbollah-says-top-commander-was-building-targeted-by-israeli-strike-fate-2024-07-31/)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut when it was targeted by Israel, but the group did not confirm his fate.

Still, a Hezbollah member of parliament said the heavily armed group would now be ready to fight a war with Israel.

The killing of its close ally Haniyeh on Iranian soil will put pressure on Tehran to react against Israel, which has been hunting Hamas leaders since militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

In response, Israel launched a relentless ground and air offensive in densely populated coastal Gaza that has killed more than 39,400 people, according to Gaza health officials, and left more than 2 million facing a humanitarian crisis.

Haniyeh's assassination could also encourage Iran's proxies in the Middle East who support Hamas - Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthis and armed groups in Iraq - to seek revenge.

Iran will "defend its territorial integrity, dignity, honour, and pride, and will make the terrorist occupiers regret their cowardly act" of killing Haniyeh in Tehran, President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday.

    10:22 AM UTC 7 last year has raged in Gaza.

Haniyeh was killed around 2 a.m. He was staying at "a special residence" for war veterans in north of Tehran, the Iranian capital.

NourNews, an outlet affiliated with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said Haniyeh's residence was hit by an airborne projectile. The assassination was "a dangerous gamble to undermine Tehran's deterrence", it said.

POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES
---------------------

Hamas said it would continue the path it was following in [the Gaza war](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
, saying: "We are confident of victory."

Israel is not seeking to escalate war, but is prepared to handle all scenarios, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said.

Gallant's comments during a visit to a missile defence battery were reported by Israeli media outlets."

Commentary by [Riley McCabe](/people/riley-mccabe)

Published August 1, 2024

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Syria, Russia Accuse US of Lying About Chemical Weapons Attacks

Print

STATE DEPARTMENT — 

Syria and Russia on Wednesday accused the United States of lying about chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian conflict as a way of derailing efforts to bring an end to the fighting.

Syria's state-run SANA news agency carried comments from a Foreign Ministry source condemning what it called "lies and allegations" by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that whenever peace efforts advance, the United States promotes "rigged, unverified reports" of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Those comments came a day after the United States joined its NATO allies in launching a pressure campaign against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, while singling out Russia for protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

"The recent attacks in East Ghouta raise serious concerns that Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime might be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said at a Paris conference hosted by Le Drian.

Tillerson said at least 20 people were killed Monday in an apparent chlorine gas attack in rebel-held East Ghouta, near Damascus.  
  
"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in East Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with chemical weapons since Russia became involved in Syria," he said.

A Syrian boy holds an oxygen mask over the face of an infant at a makeshift hospital following a reported gas attack on the rebel-held besieged town of Douma in the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, Jan. 22, 2018.

Tillerson, along with foreign ministers from France, Germany and Turkey, were among those who launched the International Partnership Against Impunity for Use of Chemical Weapons on Tuesday. More than two dozen like-minded nations endorsed a political commitment to share information on combating the use of chemical weapons worldwide.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson delivers a speech during a foreign ministers' meeting on the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons, in Paris, Jan. 23, 2018.

The U.S. secretary of state noted Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its commitment to the resolution of the overall crisis.

"At a very minimum, Russia must stop vetoing and at least abstain from future security council votes on this issue," Tillerson said.

In November, Russia vetoed the renewal of an independent and technical group created by the U.N. Security Council, the so-called Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM), to look into the perpetrators of chemical weapons attacks in Syria.  
  
"When Russia killed the JIM, they sent a dangerous message to the world — one that not only said chemical weapons use is acceptable but also that those who use chemical weapons don’t need to be identified or held accountable," U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement Tuesday.  
  
**Concern about Turkey's Afrin offensive**  
  
Turkey's offensive in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin was also a focus of Tuesday's talks in Paris, with Tillerson meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu. A day earlier, during remarks in London, the top U.S. diplomat said the United States is "concerned" about the offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria.

Turkish army tanks enter Afrin, an enclave in northern Syria controlled by U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters, in Hassa, Hatay, Turkey, Jan. 22, 2018.

  
Turkish forces intensified military operations on Monday to push the Kurdish militia out of the Afrin area.

The Turkish operation is aimed at ousting from Afrin the Syrian Kurdish group that has controlled territory in northern Syria and proven effective in the U.S.-coalition-led fight against Islamic State militants.

Turkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization associated with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

French Foreign Minister Le Drian on Tuesday joined Tillerson in expressing his concern about Turkey’s military operation in Afrin.

"I had the opportunity to tell my Turkish colleague that this offensive worries us," Le Drian said.

"While we understand the concerns Turkey has about border security, we cannot but call on Turkey to show the greatest level restraint on this issue," the French foreign minister added.

Turkey's shelling into Afrin came after the U.S.-led coalition said it would form a 30,000-strong Kurdish-led border security force in northern Syria.

Washington later said the effort had been mischaracterized and that the United States was not creating a border force, but that the coalition would provide security to liberated areas, blocking escape routes for Islamic State militants.

#### **The Issue**

*   _The international community’s failure to deter or punish Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons risks incentivizing the use of chemical weapons by others._
    *   _Assad’s use of chemical weapons has highlighted their military effectiveness and undermined the norms prohibiting their use._
*   _Increasing multipolarity has made international accountability more challenging._
*   _Actors are likely to challenge existing norms by gradually escalating their chemical weapons use from riot-control agents to toxic industrial chemicals or pharmaceutical-based agents while spreading disinformation and impeding evidence collection._
*   _The United States should strengthen detection and accountability mechanisms to deter future chemical weapons usage._
    *   _It should work with allies and partners to prioritize the early detection and prevention of chemical weapons development, develop backchannels to establish deterrence, and define clear red lines against chemical weapons usage._

#### **Introduction**

On August 21, 2013, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s army killed an estimated 1,400 people in Eastern Ghouta with sarin gas. It was the first use of chemical weapons in the Middle East in 25 years, but not the last. As he battled a dogged insurgency, Assad used sarin in another mass casualty event; he has used chlorine gas nearly 350 times.\[1\]

Following the 2013 Ghouta attack, international outrage prompted efforts to eliminate Syria’s chemical arsenal with Russia’s cooperation. Yet, accountability for war crimes has faded from the international spotlight, as has Russian cooperation to investigate and attribute chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Assad won back most of his territory and has reentered the Arab League. He transgressed international norms and survived. Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

> Assad’s success may push adversaries and allies of the United States alike to consider using chemical weapons as he did.

If such a thing happened, it would have a precedent. During the Cold War, four Arab states embarked on chemical weapons programs, with Egypt taking a pioneering role in both development and usage in the 1960s. The Egyptian military used chemical weapons on Yemeni royalists sheltering in caves in Yemen as early as June 1963, and it eventually launched around 40 separate chemical weapons attacks in the country.\[2\] Libya, Syria, and Iraq subsequently began chemical weapons programs, Iraq with Egyptian assistance. Saddam Hussein’s regime would eventually use such weapons extensively in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.\[3\] Muammar Gaddafi decided to pursue a similar capability in the 1970s and eventually used the chemical weapons developed in Chad. Syria also began developing chemical weapons in the 1970s, and with Egypt’s and, later, North Korea’s help, grew one of the most advanced chemical weapons arsenals in the world.\[4\]

The environment radically changed after the Cold War ended. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibiting the development and use of these weapons became nearly universal, with 193 State Parties in 1997 (although Syria, Egypt, and Israel did not ratify the CWC due to persistent regional tensions and unresolved arms control concerns). Still, chemical weapons use halted in the region for 25 years—until it reemerged in Syria under Assad. With the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons and rising global competition breaking the consensus around shared norms like the CWC, the circumstances may once again be ripe for renewed chemical weapons proliferation and usage in the Middle East and beyond.

To evaluate this prospect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Middle East Program undertook an investigation to assess the potential return of chemical weapons threats to the Middle East and what the United States could do about it. The project was supported by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), but the findings should in no way be interpreted to reflect the views of DTRA, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. government.

#### **Methodology**

The project’s methodology is based on desk research, 43 interviews, and a tabletop exercise (TTX). CSIS interviewed current and former U.S. and allied government officials, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and International Criminal Court (ICC) officials, chemical weapons and arms control experts, prosecutors and investigators, survivors, and Syrian regime defectors. The interviews and the TTX assessed the potential for a second wave of chemical weapons proliferation in the Middle East and identified ways that the United States could curb the threat.

The TTX evaluated potential chemical weapons users’ calculations when deciding whether and what kind of chemical weapons to use and the U.S. government’s response to chemical weapons usage in another country. The 23 participants in the TTX included current and former U.S. State Department, Defense Department, National Security Council, military, and OPCW officials, as well as chemical weapons and country experts. The CSIS-created scenarios centered on Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei as potential chemical weapons users when faced with a significant challenge to their respective regimes. These governments were chosen to reflect states with different alliances, political systems, and histories with chemical weapons, including as developers, proliferators, users, and victims. In the second part of the TTX, teams predicted what a U.S. response to chemical weapons attacks might be and how it could be improved.

#### **Analysis**

CSIS analysis revealed several alarming trends. First, most experts believe that the taboo against chemical weapons use in the Middle East is in danger and has probably already eroded. Interviews and the TTX both reinforced this point. Experts underscored the utility of these weapons’ psychological impacts, instilling terror even when used without great precision. The sobering reality is that weaponized toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine can have many of the same impacts as agents the CWC specifically bars, such as sarin. Consequently, virtually any actor can wield chemical weapons with chilling effectiveness.

CSIS also found that U.S. allies and adversaries are likely learning from Syria’s use of chemical weapons. The Syrian government’s use of Schedule 1 agents such as sarin provoked swift international condemnation, but it used TICs such as chlorine repeatedly with relative impunity. Syria’s experience, combined with ambiguity in the CWC regarding TICs, riot-control agents (RCAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs), could tempt some states to escalate attacks with these substances gradually, testing the limits of international accountability.

In addition, approaches can be blended. Assad demonstrated a successful strategy for using Schedule 1 agents sparingly for internal and external deterrence, interspersed with chlorine gas attacks for more tactical military operations. U.S. adversaries may believe that they could survive economic sanctions and other forms of international condemnation just as the Syrian regime did. Experts with whom CSIS consulted assessed that U.S. partners are likely to believe they could use their political leverage for protection against international retribution.

This latter issue points to a larger concern. A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible. With increased great power competition, the experts that CSIS consulted concluded that it will become easier for chemical weapons users to find an international patron that can protect them from accountability. The TTX and expert interviews underscored other tactics that potential users might employ to evade accountability, such as deflecting blame or disseminating disinformation. The support of powerful allies like Russia and China on the world stage would make such strategies more effective.

> A more multipolar world makes deterrence and accountability more challenging, if not impossible.

Finally, despite the ease of using TICs as weapons, experts assessed that nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors. Though governments may blame nonstate actors in “false flag” attacks, nonstate actors’ lack of technical expertise and the widescale availability of conventional weapons limit the likelihood of their usage of chemical weapons. The United States and others may also find it easier and more politically palatable to punish nonstate actors.

Experts noted that the United States could work with its allies, the OPCW, and other international bodies, including the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), to reestablish consensus on the chemical weapons taboo and pursue alternative pathways toward accountability (e.g., courts with international jurisdiction, including the ICC). Given U.S. reluctance to use military means to punish chemical weapons users, the TTX and expert interviews highlighted that prevention was key to discouraging chemical weapons use. The United States should enhance intelligence efforts to detect chemical weapons activity. Then, it should discuss alternatives with allies and backchannel robust threats and incentives to deter adversaries from using chemical weapons and inciting a mass casualty event.

**Findings and Recommendations**

**1) Finding:** The taboo against chemical weapons use has been degraded since Syria began using chemical weapons in 2013. As a result, Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

> Middle Eastern governments, including U.S. partners and allies, may be willing to use chemical weapons if there is a significant challenge to their regimes.

_**1a) Recommendation:**_ The U.S. Department of Defense and the White House, in coordination with high-ranking officials in the Middle East, should further develop a regional security architecture or regional fora similar to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to improve lines of communication and reduce the potential for misunderstanding, surprises, and unplanned escalation. This could allow the United States to prevent some actors, especially partners, from using chemical weapons.

_**1b) Recommendation:**_ The United States should use backchannels to communicate significant threats for using chemical weapons and, potentially, incentives for not using them (e.g., the United States offering to help the Egyptian military quell an insurgency using conventional means). To preempt chemical weapons attacks in this way, the United States will need to develop deeper intelligence capabilities on chemical weapons stockpiles. In Syria, having this capability prior to a major attack gave Washington a window to change Assad’s calculus.

**2) Finding:** Mediating powers and middle powers may be essential in channeling communications during a potential escalation, making incentives and warnings more effective. For example, both Syria and Egypt’s main concern in the near term is the loss of Gulf support. If the United States can win the support of Gulf states to uphold the norm, threats will be more effective.

_**2a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats and military officials should work with these mediating powers to reestablish red lines on arms control and chemical weapons usage and to deliver messages to potential chemical weapons users during times of increased threat. They could relay the message that there is widespread consensus on the need to pursue accountability if chemical weapons are used.

_**2b) Recommendation:**_ In return for existing defense and diplomatic ties, U.S. diplomats should encourage these states to act as linkages and mediators to deescalate tensions when a neighbor is facing significant challenges.

**3) Finding:** States could likely act with impunity if they eased into chemical weapons use. Learning from the Syria example, actors could test the limits of international outrage and condemnation and gradually raise the threshold of objectionable behavior. For example, they could start using RCAs in lethal ways, and then graduate to using TICs or PBAs. These chemicals, in combination with sporadic usage of Schedule 1 and 2 chemicals, could inspire fear among opposition forces or in communities while limiting an international response due to the ambiguity on their usage in the CWC.

_**3a) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should work with allies to condemn the Syrian government’s regularized use of chlorine gas and bar further normalization with the Syrian regime. U.S. diplomats in the United Nations should work with other states in UNGA to develop a consensus around prohibited uses for RCAs, TICs, and PBAs.

_**3b) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats in The Hague should work with other member states, the OPCW, and private companies, in tandem with experts at the Chemical and Biological Controls Division, the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Affairs, DTRA, and the Australia Group to better regulate the movement, storage, and usage of dual-use chemicals, TICs, RCAs, and PBAs.

**4) Finding:** Chemical weapons users are likely to spread disinformation and impede the collection of evidence to evade accountability. This limits the effectiveness of investigations and encourages usage, gradually deteriorating the CWC.

_**4a) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense—including DTRA—should support the development of evidence collection technologies such as “drone sniffers” and lab materials that would make it easier to collect evidence and train trusted organizations or civil society members to gather evidence when needed.

_**4b) Recommendation**_**:** The U.S. State Department’s CBW and DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office should work together to strengthen the credibility of the OPCW, local evidence collectors, and chemical weapons experts. These efforts should focus not only on the gathering of evidence, but also on incorporating the help of communications experts. The U.S. government should also continue to support the OPCW ChemTech Centre.

_**4c) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Defense should continue to seek support for, and even strengthen, DTRA’s Information Resiliency Office to protect the agency from disinformation. These efforts should be expanded to interagency efforts with the State Department and the UN mission to prevent the effectiveness of disinformation directed at other relevant U.S. government entities.

**5) Finding:** Chemical weapons do not stand alone. They are integrated into a broader warfighting toolkit. Governments use chemical weapons in conjunction with other military tactics, such as conventional explosive weapons and sieges, to amplify fear among armed adversaries and civilians alike. U.S. officials may underestimate the motivations for using chemical weapons because they judge the “success” of chemical weapons through direct casualty numbers rather than their broader military—and psychological—effects.

_**5a) Recommendation:**_ DTRA should analyze the secondary effects of chemical weapons usage by collecting evidence and testimony on their usage when used alongside conventional weapons to assess their tactical benefits beyond direct casualty figures. With such information, the United States may better predict why an actor would use them, prevent proliferation and attacks, and strengthen accountability for these secondary uses.

**6) Finding:** Nonstate actors appear to be a lesser threat to the chemical weapons taboo than state actors.

_**6a) Recommendation:**_ Scholars should conduct further research to determine if new delivery mechanisms and the accessibility of certain types of TICs could increase the threat of nonstate actors using chemical weapons.

**7) Finding:** Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemical weapons control and accountability.

_**7a) Recommendation:**_ To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account. For this multilateral approach to be effective, the United States needs to work more closely with members of the Global South and with China to ensure that such measures (e.g., investigations, sanctions, asset freezes, travel bans, etc.) are effective.

> To reverse the normalization of chemical weapons usage and the breakdown of other norms, U.S. diplomats should launch a preemptive and aggressive multilateral campaign to hold chemical weapons users to account.

_**7b) Recommendation:**_ To widen support of the CWC and accountability efforts, DTRA should assess the strategic reasons that actors—including adversaries such as China and allies and partners such as Egypt or India—would want to prevent the proliferation and usage of chemical weapons.

_**7c) Recommendation:**_ The United States and its allies and partners should consider supporting an entity separate from the OPCW and UNSC that would attribute violations and hold violators criminally liable. They should ensure that any such entity embraces a diverse membership. The Working Group to Advance Proposals for International Criminal Accountability for Chemical Weapons Use established in September 2024 and composed of 12 states from around the world is one step toward such an effort.

_**7d) Recommendation:**_ The Department of Justice, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, and diplomats with the OPCW and partners should enhance measures within and outside of the OPCW that would strengthen CWC prohibitions and ensure that those responsible for crimes involving chemical weapons will be brought to justice. For example, INTERPOL Washington, the U.S. National Central Bureau, should support specialized training projects for law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges. The United States and allies should also further develop the capacity of the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team to interface with national and international legal systems to prosecute those that have used chemical weapons.

_**7e) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats at the UN mission and partners should explore avenues for coalition-building around accountability and investigations within the United Nations. The United States should build coalitions with nonpermanent UNSC members and UNGA to enhance and broaden support for accountability for noncompliance with the CWC. The UNGA-created International, Impartial, and Independent Mechanism (IIIM) to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes committed since March 2011 is a good example of how effective such efforts can be. The IIIM helps to preserve evidence that states with universal jurisdiction could use for prosecution. The United States should also work to strengthen the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM) to investigate chemical weapons uses when CWC procedures do not apply or are not invoked by any State Party.

_**7f) Recommendation:**_ U.S. diplomats should consider focusing on the elimination of chemical weapons in the Middle East as the first step in a broader effort to uphold the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction.

=================================================================================

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the global community.

ByABC News

January 23, 2018, 2:24 PM

&#151; -- In the aftermath of another "apparent chlorine gas attack" by the regime of Syrian [President Bashar al-Assad](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/president-bashar-al-assad.htm)
, Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/CEOs/rex-tillerson.htm)
 blasted the Assad regime for its "crimes against humanity" but also laid some of the blame on Russia.

"Whoever conducted the attacks, Russia ultimately bears responsibility for the victims in east Ghouta and countless other Syrians targeted with [chemical weapons](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-chemical-weapons.htm)
 since Russia became involved in [Syria](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/syrian-protests.htm)
," Tillerson said in Paris at the launch of a new international group to pressure Assad and Russia.

The strong statement comes as the U.S. tries to rally the international community and assert a leadership role in Syria after seven years of war and in the face of an increasingly strong Assad regime.

As ABC News reported Monday, Tillerson highlighted the latest reported chemical weapons attack that affected more than 20 civilians -- most of them children, he said. The attack hit east Ghouta, an enclave of rebel support in the Damascus suburbs, a part of the country that Assad has long dominated. East Ghouta has been under siege by the regime for years now, but despite a cease-fire agreement over the summer, the regime has starved and bombed the area for the past few months. In recent weeks, that bombing campaign escalated, according to monitoring groups.

"The recent attacks in east Ghouta are a serious concern that Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime may be continuing its use of chemical weapons against its own people," Tillerson said. "Since April 2014, there has been mounting evidence that Syria continues to illicit possess chemical weapons and use them against its own people."

But it was Russia that Tillerson took to task, challenging the role the country plays by providing support and troops to Assad -- who, after initial defeats, now controls half of the country's population and territory.

"Russia's failure to resolve the chemical weapons issue in Syria calls into question its relevance to the resolution to the overall crisis," Tillerson said.

In particular, Tillerson said Russia had failed to live up to its commitments under the 2013 deal with the Obama administration to eliminate all of Syria's chemical weapons and other international legal obligations: "There is simply no denying that Russia, by shielding its Syrian ally, has breached its commitments to the United States as a framework guarantor. It has betrayed the Chemical Weapons Convention and U.N. [Security Council](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/security-council.htm)
 Resolution 2218," he said.

Russia has intervened in Syria on Assad's behalf since 2015, but in August 2013 it helped broker an agreement with President Barack Obama to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. That agreement came on the heels of Obama contemplating airstrikes on Syrian targets after the regime killed at least 1,400 people, including 426 children, in a chemical weapons attack, also in the Damascus suburbs, according to a U.S. government report at the time. Ultimately, Obama punted to Congress, and the U.S. never took any action.

The Trump administration challenged Syria's use of chemical weapons once before -- with a series of airstrikes last April on a Syrian air base after the regime killed dozens in a town called Khan Shaykhun.

 and the International Partnership Against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons -- the new international group Tillerson helped launch today. The 29-nation organization will collect, share and publicize information about chemical attack perpetrators, including details about sanctions.

For his part, Tillerson called on Russia to "at a bare minimum ... stop vetoing and at least abstain from future Security Council votes on this issue."

Russia has twice vetoed resolutions for an investigative body to examine who is responsible for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, and the Security Council was set to meet again on Syria on Tuesday afternoon.

"This initiative puts those who ordered and carried out chemical weapons attacks on notice. You will face a day of reckoning for your crimes against humanity and your victims will see justice done," Tillerson said in conclusion. "The people of east Ghouta are watching, and the rest of the world is watching as well."

But in a major policy address on Syria last week, Tillerson sounded a more optimistic tone on Russia and the "meaningful role" it plays in Syria -- and even praised Russia for its cooperation with the U.S. and [Jordan](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/jordan-jordanian.htm)
 on one de-escalation zone south of Damascus, despite ongoing Assad offensives elsewhere.

"That's why we're disappointed with the foreign minister's comments," Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein told ABC News Monday, a reference to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing the U.S. of fomenting unrest and instability in Syria and even supporting al Qaeda-linked militants. "The secretary is very unhappy that Russia has not stepped up to the plate as we would expect them to."

Still, with offensives against the last rebel stronghold, Idlib province, and the relentless bombing of east Ghouta, Assad and his allies, including Russia and Iran, seem to be marching onward, again and again deploying brutal tactics.

"No party in the Syrian conflict is capable of victory or stabilizing the country via military means alone," Tillerson warned, despite the regime's offensives.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

Mesut Hancer holds the hand of his 15-year-old daughter Irmak, who died in the earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, close to the epicenter, on February 7.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

Content: "They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas’ vast tunnel network under Gaza.

In the aftermath of last month’s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst.

“Had we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,” one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said.

CNN  — 

The Aljamal family was widely respected in Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip.

Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters – some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.”

As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block – which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials – to retrieve Argamani.

Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back.

Palestinians inspect the damage and debris a day after an operation by the Israeli Special Forces in the Nuseirat camp, in the central Gaza Strip on June 9, 2024, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Hamas militant group. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day.

CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment.

‘A normal man’
--------------

Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight.

Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out.

“They pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,” Mazhar said.

Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst.

“He had young children at home,” said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. In the weeks before Israel’s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah’s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before.

Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat.

Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah’s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse.

In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani’s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details.

According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel’s  Nuseirat operation last month. “No one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.”

Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he’d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was “ordinary” and “a normal man,” adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas.

“They are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,” said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. “If we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.”

After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site.

More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured."

Background
----------

The Nuseirat refugee camp was established in the Gaza Strip after the [Palestinians were expelled or fled from Israel](/wiki/1948_Palestinian_expulsion "1948 Palestinian expulsion")
 during the [1948 Palestine war](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war "1948 Palestine war")
. On 7 October 2023, the Qassam Brigades (the militant wing of the [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 party) launched [an attack on Israel](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
.[\[23\]](#cite_note-25)
 As part of the attack, in which other Palestinian militant groups were also involved, Hamas, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad](/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad "Palestinian Islamic Jihad")
 and other Palestinian militant groups kidnapped 251 Israeli civilians and soldiers.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)
 This attack led to the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
.[\[24\]](#cite_note-Reliefweb-2023-26)

The [Nuseirat refugee camp](/wiki/Nuseirat_refugee_camp "Nuseirat refugee camp")
 is a long-standing [UNRWA](/wiki/UNRWA "UNRWA")
 refugee camp located in the middle of the Gaza Strip, in [Deir al-Balah](/wiki/Deir_al-Balah "Deir al-Balah")
.[\[25\]](#cite_note-27)
 The camp has been repeatedly bombed during the Israel-Hamas war, with over a hundred Palestinians killed in the attacks. All of them need to be released immediately."

Humans of Gaza: 9-year-old Mayar and 6-year-old Bilal, inseparable siblings
===========================================================================

Saturday, 25 November 2023 6:54 PM  **\[ Last Update: Saturday, 25 November 2023 6:54 PM \]**

! He didn't let grief come in the way of discharging his professional duties.

Darling of her parents, 9-year-old Mayar was the closest confidant of her brother Bilal.

She was a few years older than Bilal, but the siblings shared a beautiful bond. An Israeli airstrike cut short their young lives together.

The girl with an infectious smile was killed with her little brother and mother in an Israeli airstrike on their home in the besieged Gaza Strip on October 23.

The father was not at home at the time. The siblings would always be seen together - playing, studying, walking hand in hand.

The grief-stricken father, who had pinned high hopes on his children, was forced by the occupation to lower their lifeless bodies into a grave, bidding them farewell with a heavy heart and teary eyes.

Reporters Without Borders has described Gaza as the “cemetery of journalists.” However, for journalists reporting from Gaza, the tragedy extends to their entire families, including children.

Mohammed Abu Hatab, a journalist working with Palestine TV, was killed with his family as Israel bombed his home in Gaza’s Khan Younis, in the south of the territory, on November 3.

Palestine TV said that the deliberate Israeli attacks on reporters “is a bloody message to terrorize Palestinian journalists,” intended to stop them from “conveying the suffering of the Palestinian people and exposing the crimes of the occupation”.

In late October, the family of Wael Dahdouh, Al Jazeera Arabic bureau chief in Gaza, was killed in an Israeli air raid. The images of their funeral became viral on social media.

Journalists and their families in Gaza have also been receiving threatening calls from the Israeli military and spies, warning them of unwanted repercussions for laying bare the regime’s crimes.

“Another threat by occupation to not go to Gaza City,” Motaz Azaiza, a prominent Gaza journalist, wrote on his Instagram handle while sharing the recording of a phone call on November 24.

**By Humaira Ahad**

Mayar wanted to become a journalist like her father. He was busy covering the war for Palestine TV.

Mayar excelled in her studies and had big dreams for her future. She wanted to show Gaza and the plight of her people to the world.

From a young age, the 9-year-old had learned the art of storytelling and being forthright from her journalist father as she grew up watching him cover the news every single day.

Bilal, on the other hand, appeared to be reserved, most of the time clinging to his sister whom he loved dearly."

Mayar and Bilal are two children of Palestine TV correspondent Nidal Hamida. Like thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza the Israeli brutal airstrikes ended up their lives along with their dreams. 

Mayar was a few years older than her brother Bilal. They were though attached to each other always playing together and having fun at home while enjoying the love of their parents. 

All those who knew Mayar said she was a smart girl as she excelled in her school subjects and was dreaming of becoming a journalist just like her father but the Israeli hideous bombardment ended her dream by killing her along with her brother Bilal and their mother in October 2023. 

Their father who has been covering the Israeli aggression on Gaza as many other journalists was left alone to continue his job with grief and pain for his great loss and concern over losing more of his family members. 

Since October 7 Israel has been waging a heinous genocide in Gaza Strip via air ground and sea attacks resulting in more than 40000 martyrs wounded and missing people. 

“We Are Not Numbers” is a series that reviews part of the available stories of some Palestinian martyrs who have fallen in the Israeli aggression on Gaza.

The claim states that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed on July 6, 2024, at the Al-Jaoni UN school. However, the evidence indicates that Mayar and Bilal Hamida were killed in October 2023, not July 2024, in an Israeli airstrike. The evidence also mentions a separate event on June 8, 2024, in Nuseirat, where many Palestinians were killed.

Therefore, the claim is inaccurate regarding the date of the children's death and the location.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

In 1917, the administration of [President](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States")

 One ascribed motivation was to thwart former president [Theodore Roosevelt](/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt")

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")

 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)

 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)

At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)

Jerusalem  — 

As the earliest stages of a [massive assault](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.

The takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/09/middleeast/nentanyahu-israel-gaza-analysis-intl)
 said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000.

Those plans have sparked growing condemnation [both internationally and domestically](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 over fears that the spiraling humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza will worsen – and that the lives of the remaining hostages will be further at risk from an expanded military operation.

The Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig. He [told CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-terror-attack/)
 in an interview in February of last year that once Israel invaded Rafah in southern Gaza, “the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion.”

Now, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war.

But that operation also targets a city that is home to more than a million people, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza.

More than 22 months since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, over 2 million people in Gaza have been struggling with severe hunger, disease and displacement amid Israel’s siege.

Cases of child malnutrition have tripled across Gaza in “less than six months,” according to the United Nations, as humanitarian workers [urged Israel](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fpress-releases%2F2025%2F08%2Fgaza-israel-must-restore-un-humanitarian-system-stave-starvation-say-un&data=05%7C02%7Cjerome.taylor%40cnn.com%7Cac449314fcdd4420e59b08dde02dbaa9%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638913209256057834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZFc6p7J7iZRcGh9Y8O%2BDrA9RqOX7abUnaTHPbP56Osg%3D&reserved=0)
 to lift severe restrictions on aid entering the besieged enclave.

Nearly 1 in 3 children are malnourished in Gaza City, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in what he called a “a man-made, preventable starvation”.

Netanyahu’s government have repeatedly denied that starvation is rife in the enclave.

Netanyahu defends Gaza City takeover as UN warns of ‘calamity’ and international condemnation grows](/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)

The Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military also said it has begun warning medical officials and international aid organizations in northern Gaza to plan for mass evacuation and displacement of the Palestinian population ahead of the planned Gaza City takeover.

The forced evacuation of the healthcare system risks worsening an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis gripping the besieged territory.

An Israeli military official told CNN that there will be “several steps” before Israeli ground forces move into the city. To continue fighting what has become the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.

But it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.

Defrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. “The war is over a year ago,” said Halutz, describing the current plan as having “no logic.” The retired general was careful not to call on Israelis to refuse to serve, but he encouraged reservists to “act according to his conscience, to his set of rules.”

Netanyahu promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. The IDF has begun preparing for the city’s evacuation by sending in more tents for displaced Palestinians, but evacuation warnings have not yet been issued.

When Israel’s security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.

After nearly [two years of war](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gaza-war-expansion-explainer-intl)
, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.

A new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40% of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13% were more motivated."

The United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution on November 20, 2024, that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:k>). The resolution, which was related to the war between Israel and Hamas, was supported by 14 Council members.

## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US. The search results focus on the US's actions within the UN Security Council regarding a ceasefire resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war.

To verify the claim, information about any draft reinstitution is missing.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the topic of conscription in the United States. One source is a Wikipedia article that details the history of conscription, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the end of the draft in 1973, and mentions a 2024 meeting memo suggesting modifications to the Selective Service Act, such as registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills (<image:k>). Another source, an article published on August 8, 2024, discusses the possibility of a draft in the US and mentions public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing (<image:k>).

### Evidence from `web_search`
The ABC10 article from 2025 fact-checks the claim that the US military draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war](https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war)).

A CNN article from August 20, 2025, discusses the Israeli military's manpower issues and mentions Israel calling up reservists and extending service, as well as considering drafting ultra-Orthodox men ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US did not reinstitute the draft for the Israel-Hamas war. An ABC10 article fact-checks and debunks the claim. While there were discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act and public rumors about the US being on a wartime footing, there is no evidence of the draft being reinstituted.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that the US did not reinstitute the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. While there were discussions and rumors, a fact-check article explicitly debunked the claim.

`false`


## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is false. While there were discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act and public rumors, a fact-check article from ABC10 ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)) explicitly debunked the claim.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

Madonna [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyI29uYO0bh/?hl=en)
 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

WME said it will [match employee donations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyO3Tcqy1nm/?hl=en&img_index=1)

The Royals have also lent their support to Israel.

The quote attributed to Johnson began circulating online in late July, at around the same time the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification [said](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/countries-in-focus-archive/issue-133/en/)
 on July 29 that, due to Israel's ongoing military offensive and [blockade](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-war-news-07-30-2025-9b9b516f22e61bd1dde879733fdd97aa)
, about 2 million Palestinians in Gaza were living in the "worst-case scenario of famine."

Several celebrities are using social media to show support for Israel and denounce Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians which left at least 1,000 people dead.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From [Gal Gadot](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/gal-gadot-reacts-to-israeli-palestine-conflict-101696757328407.html)
, Sonam Kapoor, [Gigi Hadid](https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/what-is-gigi-hadid-and-bella-hadids-connection-with-palestine-mohamed-anwar-hadid-101697011221005.html)
 to Dwayne Johnson, celebrities are taking to social media to show their support for [Israel](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-position-vis-a-vis-israel-palestine-conflict-101697021932828.html)
 amid the country’s declared war against [Hamas](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-war-live-updates-hamas-jerusalem-benjamin-netanyahu-gaza-strip-lebanon-joe-biden-qatar-101696981753474.html)
 following the attack by the Palestinian militants last weekend. She re-posted a viral infographic via her Instagram Story that stated, “It is absolutely reasonable and logical to be opposed to the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians while simultaneously calling for the protection of Jews in Israel and around the world”.

Liev Schreiber
--------------

In his Instagram stories, the Ray Donovan star, 56, shared a post from the organisation StandWithUs, dedicated to opposing anti-semitism, which included an image of the Israeli flag and read, “Now and always, we stand with the people of Israel!” Below the post, he wrote, “We stand with the people of Israel and the IDF in their fight against Hamas and other terrorist groups. I also feel a responsibility to my Jewish friends to make it clear, as I have before: While I have hopes and dreams for Palestinians, none of them include the harm of a Jewish person,” she wrote on Instagram.

Dwayne Johnson
--------------

Actor Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, posted a long note, wherein he ‘condemned and denounced terrorism’. The sanctity of our common humanity will hopefully serve to heal the unimaginable wounds of division.

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.
