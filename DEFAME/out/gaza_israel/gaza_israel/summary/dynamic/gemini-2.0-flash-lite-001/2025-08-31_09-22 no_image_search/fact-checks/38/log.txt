Useful result: From [Source](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/360deg-reactions-assassination-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh): 
Content: The Wilson Center discusses the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the senior political leader of Hamas. The assassination took place on Iranian soil. The article mentions that Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. The armed wing of Hamas said the assassination would “take the battle to new dimensions and have major repercussions.” The article also mentions that the Biden administration should put pressure to restrain Israel and Iran.

The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. While the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, is confirmed by multiple sources, including the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh), the evidence does not confirm that the provided image depicts the assassination location or method.

So, the overall veracity is: false
