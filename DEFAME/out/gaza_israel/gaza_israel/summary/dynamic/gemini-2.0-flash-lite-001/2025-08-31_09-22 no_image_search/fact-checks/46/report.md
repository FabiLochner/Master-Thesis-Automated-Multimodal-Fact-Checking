## Final Judgement
The search results do not provide any information about a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. Instead, the search results mention criticism of Bono and Geldof regarding the situation in Gaza and Geldof's refusal to organize a "Live Aid for Palestine." Therefore, the claim is demonstrably false. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
