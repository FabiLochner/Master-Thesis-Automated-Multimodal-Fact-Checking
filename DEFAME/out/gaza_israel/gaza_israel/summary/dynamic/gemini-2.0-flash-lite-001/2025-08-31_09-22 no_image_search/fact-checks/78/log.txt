Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next): 
Content: Al Jazeera reported on October 1, 2024, that Iran launched a missile attack against Israel <image:k>. The attack was in response to Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of IRGC, Hamas, and Hezbollah leaders. The article mentions that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had "made a big mistake" and "will pay for it".

The claim 'Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid Iran's missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu fled to Poland during the attack. Instead, evidence suggests he responded to the attack, and the Israeli Security Cabinet convened in a bunker.

So, the overall veracity is: false
