## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The DW.COM fact-check states that the black ribbon on the UNRWA logo, seen in ![image 18](media/24.jpg), was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and has been present since at least October 22, 2023. The CFI UK news article also mentions the controversy surrounding UNRWA's support for Hamas and states that the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20. The France 24 article discusses claims that an UNRWA ID was found among Yahya Sinwar's belongings, and that one of the men killed alongside Sinwar was an UNRWA employee, as seen in ![image 1](media/0.jpg).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the black ribbon on the UNRWA logo was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and has been present since at least October 22, 2023. The claim that the black band was placed in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar is not supported by the evidence. The evidence suggests the black stripe was added in October 2023 when the death toll of UNRWA members reached 20.


## Final Judgement
The claim is false because the black ribbon on the UNRWA logo was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and has been present since at least October 22, 2023, not in mourning for the death of Yahya Sinwar. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. The black ribbon on the UNRWA logo, as seen in the image, was added to show solidarity with the victims of war and has been present since at least October 22, 2023, according to a DW.COM fact-check ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)).
