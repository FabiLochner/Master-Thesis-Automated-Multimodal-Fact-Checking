```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Bangladesh': 0.88, 'Pakistan': 0.07, 'India': 0.02, 'Palestine': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0, 'Argentina': 0.0, 'Australia': 0.0, 'Austria': 0.0, 'Belgium': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The images in the claim are from a pro-Palestine protest held in Suhrawardy Udyan in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on April 12, 2025, and not in Kolkata, India, as the claim suggests. The event was a "March for Gaza" to show solidarity with Palestinians. The articles from [Factly.in](https://factly.in/photos-of-a-protest-held-in-solidarity-with-palestine-in-dhaka-bangladesh-are-falsely-shared-as-those-from-kolkata/) and [NewsMobile](https://www.newsmobile.in/nm-fact-checker/fact-check-images-of-pro-palestine-protest-in-bangladeshs-dhaka-falsely-linked-to-india/) confirm this. ![image 11618](media/2025-08-31_10-41-1756636906-588664.jpg), ![image 11621](media/2025-08-31_10-41-1756636913-707032.jpg), ![image 11629](media/2025-08-31_10-43-1756636988-219999.jpg)

The article from [Tezzfeed.com](https://tezzfeed.com/latest-news/palestinian-media-shares-bangladeshs-pro-gaza-protest-photos-mistakenly-labels-them-as-kolkata-1744522142539) also mentions that the photos were mistakenly labeled as being in Kolkata.


## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The images depict a pro-Palestine protest that took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Kolkata, India. The event, a "March for Gaza," occurred on April 12, 2025, as confirmed by multiple sources, including Factly.in and NewsMobile.


## Final Judgement
The images in the claim are from a pro-Palestine protest held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and not in Kolkata, India, as the claim suggests. The event was a "March for Gaza" to show solidarity with Palestinians.
