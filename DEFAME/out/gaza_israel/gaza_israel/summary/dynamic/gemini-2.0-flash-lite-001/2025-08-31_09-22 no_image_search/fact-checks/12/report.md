The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024. The ICJ's advisory opinion stated that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law. The article mentions the UN General Assembly resolution that gave effect to the ICJ's opinion.

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and obligated it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the ICJ declared Israel an "illegal state." However, the ICJ's advisory opinion did find Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful.


## Final Judgement
The ICJ's advisory opinion found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, obligating it to end its presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. While the ICJ did not explicitly declare Israel an "illegal state," it did find Israel's presence unlawful.

The claim is not entirely accurate as it uses the term "illegal state" which is not explicitly stated by the ICJ. However, the ICJ did find Israel's presence unlawful. Therefore, the claim is misleading. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE
