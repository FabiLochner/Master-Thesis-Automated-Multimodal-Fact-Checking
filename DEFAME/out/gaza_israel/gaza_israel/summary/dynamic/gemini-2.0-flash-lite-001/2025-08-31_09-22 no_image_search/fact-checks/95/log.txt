Content: The image shows Mesut Hancer holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, on February 7, 2023. <image:62> The article was published on February 13, 2023, by CNN.

The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts Mesut Hancer in Turkey holding the hand of his deceased daughter, Irmak, who died in an earthquake in February 2023, not a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July 2024, as evidenced by multiple news sources like [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-earthquake-latest-news-death-toll-b2279788.html).
