Content: The search result from Getty Images provides stock photos and images of strawberry fields. <image:0>, <image:1>, <image:2>, <image:3>, <image:4>, <image:5>, <image:6>, <image:7>, <image:8>, <image:9>, <image:10>, <image:11>, <image:12>, <image:13>, <image:14>, <image:15>, <image:16>, <image:17>, <image:18>, <image:19>, <image:20>, <image:21>, <image:22>, <image:23>, <image:24>.

The claim '<image:25> This image shows the youngest victim of the Hezbollah rocket that murdered 12 children playing soccer in Israel on July 27, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While there was a rocket attack on July 27, 2024, that killed children, the image provided in the claim is of a child in a strawberry field and is unrelated to the attack. The evidence includes reports from the UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152581](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/07/1152581)) and the BBC ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c6p2979yyyzt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c6p2979yyyzt)) about the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
