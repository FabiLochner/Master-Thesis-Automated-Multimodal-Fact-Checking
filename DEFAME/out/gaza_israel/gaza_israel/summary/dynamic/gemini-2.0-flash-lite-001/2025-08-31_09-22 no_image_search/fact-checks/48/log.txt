Useful result: From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czq6v9jx939o): 
Content: The BBC reports that on July 26, 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. During the visit, Trump criticized Kamala Harris's remarks on Israel as "disrespectful." Netanyahu stated that Israel would send negotiators to ceasefire talks. The article does not mention a phone call on August 14, 2024, or Trump urging Netanyahu to stop a ceasefire deal to help Harris's campaign.

The claim 'In a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14, 2024, Donald Trump told the Israeli prime minister to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal because it would help Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.' is false.
Justification: The claim that Donald Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu to stop a Gaza ceasefire deal to hurt Kamala Harris's campaign on August 14, 2024, is unverified. While a phone call between Trump and Netanyahu on that date is confirmed, with discussions about a Gaza ceasefire, the evidence presents conflicting reports about the call's content. One source alleges Trump's actions, but both Trump and Netanyahu deny it.

So, the overall veracity is: false
