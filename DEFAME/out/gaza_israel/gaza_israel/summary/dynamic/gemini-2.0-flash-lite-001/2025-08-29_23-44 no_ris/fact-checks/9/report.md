## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran and western Iran on October 26, 2024, including the Khojir Military Complex, Hazrat Amir Brigade Air Defense Site, and Parchin Military Complex.

CNN and Al Jazeera also published articles on October 26, 2024, discussing Israeli strikes in Iran. ([https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/middleeast/israel-strikes-iran-explainer-intl-hnk), [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/10/26/live-israel-attacks-targets-across-iran-warns-tehran-against-retaliation)) ![image 6928](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-121773.jpg), ![image 6929](media/2025-08-29_21-10-1756501850-652723.jpg)


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'China': 0.42, 'Malaysia': 0.32, 'Taiwan': 0.13, 'Singapore': 0.03, 'Australia': 0.01, 'India': 0.01, 'Japan': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israeli strikes occurred in Iran on October 26, 2024. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) published a map showing the locations of IDF strikes around Tehran and western Iran on that date. CNN and Al Jazeera also reported on the strikes.

The image search results do not provide any information about the image in the claim. The geolocate action suggests that the image was most likely taken in China or Malaysia.

Based on the evidence, the claim cannot be verified. There is no information to confirm that the image depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Israeli strikes occurred in Iran on October 26, 2024, but the image search results do not provide any information about the image in the claim. The geolocate action suggests that the image was most likely taken in China or Malaysia.

Since there is no evidence to confirm that the image depicts an Israeli missile attack on Iran, the claim is not factually accurate. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While there were indeed Israeli strikes in Iran on October 26, 2024, as reported by the [Institute for the Study of War](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-october-26-2024), CNN, and Al Jazeera, the image in the claim cannot be verified as depicting such an attack. The geolocate action suggests the image was likely taken in China or Malaysia.
