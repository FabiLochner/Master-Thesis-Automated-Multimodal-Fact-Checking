The claim '<image:10> This is an authentic image of Israel bombing Beirut's International Airport in October 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is **false**. While there were Israeli airstrikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, as reported by sources like the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)), the provided evidence does not definitively confirm the authenticity of the image in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
