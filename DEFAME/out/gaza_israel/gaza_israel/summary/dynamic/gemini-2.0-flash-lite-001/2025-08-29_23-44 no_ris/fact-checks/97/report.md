## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The United States vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution on November 20, 2024, that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip (<image:k>). The resolution, which was related to the war between Israel and Hamas, was supported by 14 Council members.

The Security Council Report also discussed the draft resolution and the US's stance on it. These events are detailed in reports from the UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157216)), the Security Council Report ([https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/vote-on-a-draft-resolution-on-the-war-in-gaza.php)), and the United Nations website ([https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15907.doc.htm](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15907.doc.htm)).


## Elaboration
The provided evidence does not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US. The search results focus on a UN Security Council draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war and the US's veto of it.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the history of conscription in the United States, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the end of the draft in 1973. One source mentions a 2024 meeting memo suggesting modifications to the Selective Service Act, such as registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills. Another article discusses the possibility of a draft in the US, mentioning public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing.

The sources include a Wikipedia article on conscription in the United States ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)) and an article from War on the Rocks ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The ABC10 article fact-checks the claim that the US military draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war, published in 2025 by Google LLC ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war](https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war)).

CNN published an article on August 20, 2025, discussing potential manpower issues for the Israeli military, including calling up reservists and extending service, and the possibility of drafting ultra-Orthodox men (<image:k>, <image:j>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US did not reinstitute the draft for the Israel-Hamas war in 2024. A fact-check from ABC10 explicitly states that there was no such draft. While there are discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act, and the possibility of a draft, these are not directly linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

The provided sources discuss the history of conscription in the United States and the possibility of a draft, but they do not confirm the claim. The ABC10 fact-check explicitly refutes the claim.


## Final Judgement
The search results confirm that the US did not reinstitute the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war. A fact-check from ABC10 explicitly states that there was no such draft. While there are discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act, these are not directly linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

The claim is demonstrably false as it is disproven by evidence from reliable sources. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the US reinstituted the draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war is false. A fact-check from ABC10 ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)) explicitly refutes the claim.
