## Claim
Claim: "![image 43](media/71.jpg) This image shows a vegetable stand in Gaza in January 2025 with a Merkava tank, the pride of the Israeli army, as its decor."

## Actions
```
web_search("vegetable stand Gaza Merkava tank")
geolocate(![image 43](media/71.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The image (![image 43](media/71.jpg)) shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, modified into a fruit stand. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The article was published on February 3, 2025, by Elias Atienza. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html))

The Merkava tank is an Israeli main battle tank, in service since 1979. It has been used in several wars, including the Gaza War. (![image 43](media/71.jpg)) shows a Merkava Mk 4M Windbreaker, equipped with the Trophy active protection system. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava))


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Turkey': 0.26, 'Ukraine': 0.13, 'Palestine': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.11, 'Tunisia': 0.07, 'Bulgaria': 0.06, 'Kyrgyzstan': 0.02, 'Macedonia': 0.02, 'Pakistan': 0.02, 'Albania': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The claim is inaccurate. The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank. The image was taken in Syria, not Gaza. The evidence also indicates that the Merkava tank is an Israeli tank, and the image shows a different type of tank.


## Final Judgement
The image shows a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, and the location is Syria, not Gaza. The claim also incorrectly states the tank as the pride of the Israeli army.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a Syrian T-55 tank, not an Israeli Merkava tank, and was taken in Syria, not Gaza, as confirmed by a fact-check published by Elias Atienza ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-image-claims-show-141025316.html)).
