### Evidence from `image_search`
From [Source](https://factly.in/an-old-image-from-2020-of-a-damaged-toilet-in-hong-kong-is-falsely-shared-as-a-recent-hezbollah-incident-in-lebanon/): 
Content: The image ![image 8317](media/2025-08-29_23-48-1756511305-611523.jpg) shows a damaged toilet. The source claims the image is old and from 2020.


## Elaboration

The image shows a damaged toilet, but the evidence indicates that the image is old and not related to a recent Hezbollah incident in Lebanon. The image was taken out of context and misrepresented. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
