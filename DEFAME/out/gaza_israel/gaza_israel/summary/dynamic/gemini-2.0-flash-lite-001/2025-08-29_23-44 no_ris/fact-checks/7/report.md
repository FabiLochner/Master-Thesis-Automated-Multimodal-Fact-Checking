## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
An article from the Atlantic Council, published on March 18, 2025, discusses the US approach toward the Houthis, mentioning that Trump ordered airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 15, 2025, in response to attacks on Red Sea shipping. The article also mentions that Russia has aided Houthi operations. ![image 635](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873629-385726.jpg), ![image 637](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873641-091924.jpg), ![image 638](media/2025-07-18_21-20-1752873641-843828.jpg) An ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners, describing the attacks as a "renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route." The article mentions that the attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes.

The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport. It also mentions that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests the claim is false. The Atlantic Council article indicates that Trump ordered airstrikes against the Houthis in March 2025, and ABC News reported Houthi attacks in the Red Sea in July 2025. These events contradict the claim of a final cessation of military operations. The Wikipedia article mentions a ceasefire in 2025, but also a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport in 2025, which further contradicts the claim.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that the Houthis did not cease military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election. Multiple sources, including articles from the Atlantic Council and ABC News, report on Houthi attacks and US airstrikes in 2025, directly contradicting the claim.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that military operations continued after Trump's election, with the US conducting airstrikes and the Houthis launching attacks in 2025.
