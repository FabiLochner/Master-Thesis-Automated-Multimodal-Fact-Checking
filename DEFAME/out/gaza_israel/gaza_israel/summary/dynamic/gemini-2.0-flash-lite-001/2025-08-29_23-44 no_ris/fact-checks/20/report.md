## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim that $50 million in US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza, stating that the White House offered no evidence. USAID spent no money on condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 fiscal years.

Anadolu Agency ([Source](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/musk-walks-back-claim-us-intended-to-send-50m-worth-of-condoms-to-gaza/3479148)) reports that Elon Musk backtracked on the claim, and a review of USAID data from 2007 to 2023 showed no record of condom shipments to Gaza. The Washington Post ([Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/29/gaza-condoms-fact-checker-trump/)) published an analysis stating that DOGE and OMB found that $50 million in taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. <image:k> ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The claim is not supported by the evidence. CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it. Furthermore, USAID did not spend any money on condoms in the Middle East in the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023. Elon Musk also backtracked on the claim.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. Multiple sources, including CNN and the Anadolu Agency, have fact-checked the claim and found no evidence to support it. Additionally, USAID data from 2007 to 2023 shows no record of condom shipments to Gaza.

Fact-checks by CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and other sources found no evidence to support the claim that US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza.
