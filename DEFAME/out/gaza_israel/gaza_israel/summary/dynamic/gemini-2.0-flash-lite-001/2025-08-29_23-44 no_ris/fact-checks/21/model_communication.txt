Published On 4 Feb 20254 Feb 2025

United States President Donald Trump is planning to cut off US engagement with the United Nations Human Rights Council and extend a funding ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, an unnamed White House official told US media outlets.

US news media, including Politico and NPR, reported on Monday that Trump was expected to sign an executive order withdrawing from the two UN bodies on Tuesday, the same day the White House is [expected to host](/news/2025/1/28/israels-netanyahu-to-meet-with-trump-at-white-house-next-week)
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime critic of the UN, and UNRWA in particular.

Since taking office for a second term on January 20, Trump has already withdrawn the US from [the World Health Organization (WHO)](/news/2025/1/28/what-a-us-exit-from-the-who-means-for-global-healthcare)
 and the [Paris climate agreement](/news/2025/1/21/drill-baby-whats-the-paris-climate-deal-why-does-trump-want-out)
, which he also withdrew from during his first term – a move that was later reversed by the Biden administration.

Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the UN Human Rights Council would also not be a first for Trump, who withdrew from the council in his first term.

When the Trump administration quit the Human Rights Council in 2018, Trump’s then-UN envoy Nikki Haley claimed the move was due to “chronic bias” against Israel from the body, which is made up of 47 UN member states who are elected for four-year terms.

The council conducts periodic reviews of the human rights records of UN member states, including the US, which is due to undergo its next review in August.

During the council’s last review of the US in 2020, countries offered recommendations on how Washington might improve its human rights record, including by tackling racism and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison.

The council is also responsible for appointing human rights experts to serve as independent UN special rapporteurs.

Several UN special rapporteurs have accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, including, most notably, the special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese.

As an elected member of the council, most recently from 2022-2024, the US has also leveraged its position to criticise the human rights record of other countries.

UNRWA order comes as Netanyahu visits White House
-------------------------------------------------

Trump’s plan to sign another executive order specifically targeting the embattled UNRWA coincides with Netanyahu’s visit to the White House.

According to a UNRWA [situation report](https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-156-situation-gaza-strip-and-west-bank-including-east-jerusalem)
, Israeli forces killed 272 UNRWA staff members during Israel’s 15-month onslaught on the Gaza Strip and repeatedly attacked UNRWA buildings, including schools where thousands of Palestinians were seeking shelter.

In October, Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, passed two bills [banning UNRWA operations](/news/2024/10/29/what-does-unrwa-do-and-why-has-israel-banned-it-from-west-bank-gaza)
 within Israel’s borders, including occupied East Jerusalem, which came into effect last week. Founded by the UN General Assembly in 1949, UNRWA provides aid, health and education services to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

![UNRWA at a glance](/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/INTERACTIVE-UNRWA-at-a-glance-1706592698.png?w=770&resize=770%2C770&quality=80)

The US was UNRWA’s biggest donor, providing $300m to $400m a year, but Biden paused funding in January 2024 after Israel made unfounded accusations about a dozen UNRWA staff taking part in the deadly October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas.

Although an independent report found that Israeli authorities [did not provide evidence](/news/2024/4/22/no-evidence-of-unrwa-staff-links-terrorist-groups-independent-review)
 for their claims to the UN, the US Congress decided to formally suspend contributions to UNRWA until at least March 2025. The [UN later found](/news/2024/8/5/un-says-nine-employees-may-have-been-involved-in-october-7-hamas-attack)
 that nine employees may have been involved in the attack and were fired.

UNRWA is playing a vital role in Gaza’s recovery as a fragile ceasefire continues to hold between Israel and Hamas.

Trump and Netanyahu are expected to discuss the next phase of the ceasefire deal when they meet.

Speaking after Netanyahu arrived in the US on Monday, Trump said there were “no guarantees” that the ceasefire deal would hold.

According to an article published by Al Jazeera on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump is planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and is expected to sign an executive order (<image:0>). NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA; the article was updated on February 4, 2025, and originally published on February 3, 2025 (<image:3720>).

The document also directs government agencies not to use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. An NPR article states that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA, and the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP article confirms that the executive order directs government agencies not to use funds for contributions to UNRWA.

However, the evidence does not specify the exact date the executive order was signed. The claim states that the order was signed on January 20, 2025, but the provided evidence does not confirm this date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of information regarding the exact date of the executive order.

Claim: "Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, to halt all funding to UNRWA."

## Actions
```
web_search("Trump executive order UNRWA funding")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
According to an article published by Al Jazeera on February 4, 2025, Donald Trump is planning to extend a funding ban on UNRWA and is expected to sign an executive order (<image:0>). NPR reported that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA; the article was updated on February 4, 2025, and originally published on February 3, 2025 (<image:3720>).

Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP published an article on February 5, 2025, discussing a Trump Executive Order that orders the reevaluation of the United States’ commitment to UNRWA (<image:3709>). The document also directs government agencies not to use any funds for a contribution, grant, or other payment to UNRWA.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Trump signed an executive order related to UNRWA funding. An NPR article states that Trump signed an executive order to cut future funding to UNRWA, and the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP article confirms that the executive order directs government agencies not to use funds for contributions to UNRWA.

However, the evidence does not specify the exact date the executive order was signed. The claim states that the order was signed on January 20, 2025, but the provided evidence does not confirm this date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of information regarding the exact date of the executive order.

 as “killing all prospects for peace in the Middle East”. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images

The Guardian view on Gaza’s future: Israel should end the killing. Israel has killed more than 62,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

Israel’s former intelligence chief Aharon Haliva, in charge when the Hamas atrocities of 2023 took place, was recently recorded [saying that](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/israeli-general-aharon-haliva-palestinians-7-october-gaza)
 “For every person on October 7, 50 Palestinians must die. The defence minister, Israel Katz, has authorised plans for the call up of 60,000 soldiers to seize and occupy Gaza City – forcing out hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and bringing further catastrophe to exhausted, desperate and traumatised civilians. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu has an alternative: [agree to a ceasefire proposal](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/israel-to-respond-by-friday-gaza-truce-plan-hamas)
, already accepted by Hamas, and reportedly “almost identical” to an earlier plan presented by the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, which Israel accepted.

An embattled Mr Netanyahu believes a forever war can keep him at the top and fend off the [corruption trial](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/30/benjamin-netanyahu-corruption-trial-delayed-ntwnfb)
 due to recommence imminently. Reports of military discontent should be regarded with caution: it has not prevented the Israel Defense Forces from drawing up and beginning to implement plans for the Gaza City offensive. But 74% of Israelis want the war to end, and there were [huge protests](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/netanyahu-criticises-protests-israel-handling-gaza-war-hostages)
 at the weekend, mostly reflecting concern for hostages and the toll on soldiers. A survey last month [found](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/israeli-media-completely-ignored-gaza-starvation-is-that-finally-changing)
 that 79% of Jewish Israelis were “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering in Gaza.

Internationally, however, it is the suffering of Palestinians that fuels demands for the war to end and daily erodes Israel’s status and alliances. Lashing out at critics such as Australia’s “weak” prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has merely made Mr Netanyahu look more desperate and isolated and [heightened the criticism](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/australia-israel-tony-burke-netanyahu)
.

Palestinians in Gaza City can choose only whether to stay and face the Israeli onslaught, or attempt to flee, in their weakened state, with nowhere safe to go."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not support the claim. While The Guardian published an article about Gaza, and the BBC reported on Bradford's City of Culture status, neither article contains the headline stated in the claim. The Bradford Literature Festival includes an event called "Gaza 2040: Then, Now, the Future," which suggests a connection between Gaza and Bradford, but not in the way the claim suggests.

The claim's veracity cannot be confirmed with the provided evidence.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.

Claim: "The Guardian published an article with the headline: 'Gaza will rise from the ashes to become a city of the future to rival Bradford.'"

## Actions
```
web_search("The Guardian Gaza city of the future Bradford")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian published an article titled "The Guardian view on Gaza’s future: Israel should end the killing" on August 20, 2025, discussing the ongoing conflict. ([https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit))

The BBC published an article on July 6, 2025, about Bradford's year as the 2025 UK City of Culture, mentioning various events. ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo)) The Bradford Literature Festival includes an event called "Gaza 2040: Then, Now, the Future". ([https://www.bradfordlitfest.co.uk/event/gaza-2040-imagining-the-future/](https://www.bradfordlitfest.co.uk/event/gaza-2040-imagining-the-future/)) <image:3748>, <image:3749>, <image:3750>, <image:3751>, <image:3752>, <image:3753>, <image:3759>, <image:3761>, <image:3774>, <image:3779>, <image:3762>


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While The Guardian published an article about Gaza, and the BBC reported on Bradford's City of Culture status, neither article contains the headline stated in the claim. The Bradford Literature Festival includes an event called "Gaza 2040: Then, Now, the Future," which suggests a connection between Gaza and Bradford, but not in the way the claim suggests.

The claim's veracity cannot be confirmed with the provided evidence.


## Final Judgement
The search results do not show that The Guardian published an article with the headline in the claim. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence. `false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While The Guardian published an article about Gaza ([https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/20/the-guardian-view-on-gazas-future-israel-should-end-the-killing-its-allies-must-not-remain-complicit)) and the BBC reported on Bradford's City of Culture status ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv0lv8pgeo)), neither article contains the headline stated in the claim.

Visuals of Sinwar's death
-------------------------

Wounded Yahya Sinwar stares at a drone sent to inspect the building after an armed clash and tosses a stick at it.

Following Sinwar's death, the IDF released images and drone footage depicting him wounded and slumped in a chair, aiming to portray him as a fugitive. They urged Israeli and US leaders to capitalize on this military success by negotiating an immediate deal for the hostages' release, stressing that true victory can only be achieved when all the captives are safely returned.[\[76\]](#cite_note-77)

The UNRWA has been under fire following reports that at least a dozen of its staffers assisted in the terrorist attack on Israel, but the teacher, who escaped Gaza via Rafah in April, is reportedly living in Egypt, according to the correspondent.

UNRWA provides humanitarian relief for Palestinians in the Palestinian Territories and neighboring countries.Image: AFP/Getty Images

Israel's military killed its top target in Gaza, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz [confirmed late on Thursday](/en/hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-killed-in-gaza-israel/a-70524393)
. Sinwar is considered the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel in which Hamas and other militant organizations killed more than 1,200 people and abducted another 250 people into Gaza. 

Since Sinwar's death, there have been many posts on X claiming that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) changed its account's  profile picture and added the black ribbon to its logo as a sign of mourning for him. The claim can be found in several viral X posts [calling for a defunding](https://archive.ph/jCCIQ "External link — calling for a defunding")
 of the UN organization as it is allegedly mourning the death of the head of Hamas.

**DW Fact check:** False

The black ribbon alongside the UNRWA logo symbolizes solidarity with the victims of war and has been a part of the X account's profile picture since at least October 22, 2023, when UNRWA announced in a [post on X](https://archive.ph/djuKR "External link — post on X")
 that it was in shock and mourning after the killing of 29 of its colleagues in Gaza since October 7. All UNRWA accounts added a black stripe to their profile," says [this post](https://archive.ph/6ctDD "External link — this post")
 on X. On its official Facebook account, UNRWA changed its profile picture to the UNRWA logo and the black ribbon on [October 11, 2023](https://archive.ph/bupKv "External link — October 11, 2023")
. 

The black ribbon alongside the UNRWA logo has been a part of the X account's profile picture since at least October 22Image: UNRWA/X.com

We have looked at several UNRWA social media accounts on different social media platforms, but not all have the black ribbon on their profile images. On X, the [EU account of UNRWA](https://x.com/UNRWA_EU "External link — EU account of UNRWA")
 has the ribbon but the [UNRWA USA](https://x.com/unrwausa "External link — UNRWA USA")
, for example, does not.   

[DW Fact check](/en/fact-check/t-56584214)
 has reached out to UNRWA for a statement.

UNRWA target of disinformation campaigns
----------------------------------------

At the beginning of 2024, Israel claimed that some 450 UNRWA workers in Gaza were "terrorists." [A review](/en/unrwa-review-finds-neutrality-issues-no-terror-proof/a-68893802)
 of the UN agency's neutrality was prompted due to these accusations. However, the 54-page report identified "neutrality-related issues" in the implementation of the "robust" procedures UNRWA has in place to "ensure compliance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality."

Since then, the UN organization has been the target of [claims on social media](https://archive.ph/uEGYu "External link — claims on social media")
 that it is supporting terrorists, and calls to end to its funding. 

Due to the variety and amount of claims, the UNRWA addressed the main allegations in a [Claims versus Facts](https://www.unrwa.org/unrwa-claims-versus-facts-february-2024 "External link — Claims versus Facts")
 page published on its official website in May 2024.

The New York Post reports that Israeli soldiers killed Yahya Sinwar, and an apparent passport belonging to an UNRWA teacher was found on Sinwar's body ([https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/us-news/unrwa-teachers-passport-found-on-hamas-leader-sinwars-slain-body-after-israeli-forces-killed-him-photos-show/](https://nypost.com/2024/10/17/us-news/unrwa-teachers-passport-found-on-hamas-leader-sinwars-slain-body-after-israeli-forces-killed-him-photos-show/)).

The DW article fact-checks the claim that UNRWA is mourning the death of Yahya Sinwar by adding a black ribbon to its logo, stating that the black ribbon was added to the profile picture on X before Sinwar's death, specifically since at least October 22, 2023, to show solidarity with the victims of war ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)).

Content: The NBC News article discusses Israel's ban on UNRWA in Palestinian territories. <image:8422>


## Elaboration
The claim is not accurate. The evidence indicates that the black ribbon on UNRWA's profile picture on X was added before Yahya Sinwar's death, specifically since at least October 22, 2023, to show solidarity with the victims of war ([https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-black-ribbon-on-unrwa-logo-does-not-show-mourning-for-sinwar/a-70532996)).


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. The black ribbon on UNRWA's profile picture predates the death of Yahya Sinwar and was not added in mourning for him.

, recommended the EUMC working definition of antisemitism, as used by the UK's [College of Policing](/wiki/College_of_Policing "College of Policing")
.[\[126\]](#cite_note-130)
 In October 2016, the cross-party Commons [Home Affairs Select Committee](/wiki/Home_Affairs_Select_Committee "Home Affairs Select Committee")
 published a report on antisemitism in the UK, noting that the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews gave evidence describing the IHRA-WDA as "helpful, comprehensive and fit for purpose", as well as some of the criticisms of the definition. [Pro-Israel](/wiki/Pro-Israel "Pro-Israel")
 organizations have been advocates for the worldwide legal adoption of the IHRA working definition.[\[11\]](#cite_note-Penslar_2022_pp._133–145-12)

It has been described as an example of a [persuasive definition](/wiki/Persuasive_definition "Persuasive definition")
, and as a "prime example of language being both the site of, and stake in, struggles for power".[\[12\]](#cite_note-13)
 The examples relating to Israel have been criticised by academics, including legal scholars, who say that they are often used to [weaponize antisemitism](/wiki/Weaponization_of_antisemitism "Weaponization of antisemitism")
 in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. Marcus writes that the larger issue was missed that the definition of antisemitism used by the EUMC was based on "seven stereotypical traits: deceptiveness, strange-ness, hostility, greed, corruption, conspiratorial power, and deicidal murderousness".[\[26\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-30)
 The EUMC report concluded that anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist expression could only be considered antisemitic if it was based on the stereotype of Israel as the collective Jew.[\[27\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015153-154-31)

Following the EUMC report, the [Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe](/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe")
 (OSCE)'s Berlin Declaration recognised that post-[World War II](/wiki/World_War_II "World War II")
 antisemitism had changed and was now at times directed against Jews as a collective and Israel as an embodiment of the Jew.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 The Berlin Declaration also tasked the OSCE's [Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights](/wiki/Office_for_Democratic_Institutions_and_Human_Rights "Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights")
 (ODIHR) to work with the EUMC to develop better ways to monitor antisemitic incidents in OSCE countries.[\[28\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015159–160-32)
 According to Marcus, the EUMC scrapped this failed definition of antisemitism, largely due to pressure from American Jewish organizations.[\[29\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015160-33)

EUMC publication
----------------

### Initial publication

At the suggestion of the AJC, the EUMC director organized a meeting of Jewish representatives to discuss the new definition of antisemitism which had been drafted.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 The consultation involved representatives of the AJC and [European Jewish Congress](/wiki/European_Jewish_Congress "European Jewish Congress")
, the EUMC director and head of research, and the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination program director and antisemitism expert.[\[22\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010a-26)
 The outcome was negotiated between Andrew Baker, Stern's colleague at the AJC, and Beate Winkler, director of the EUMC.[\[30\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStern2010-34)
 According to Michael Whine of the [Community Security Trust](/wiki/Community_Security_Trust "Community Security Trust")
, the Director of the ODIHR Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Division and the Advisor on Antisemitism "played an active role in formulating the Working Definition".[\[36\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWhine2010-40)

On 28 January 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [antisemitism](/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism")
 on its website that shared many features of Stern's earlier draft.[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)
 Winkler published the definition "without formal review by her political overseers".[\[8\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015166–167-9)
 Marcus writes that it was a "working definition" in two senses: a working guide to identifying antisemitism in practice, and a work-in-progress as opposed to a final statement to be approved by the EU's political leadership, and "for this reason, formal endorsement was neither sought nor obtained".[\[37\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarcus2015161–162-41)

The stated purpose of the working definition was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism".[\[38\]](#cite_note-definition-42)
 It said:

> Antisemitism is a certain perception of [Jews](/wiki/Jews "Jews")
> , which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."[\[95\]](#cite_note-workdef-99)
 After "taking into account the overall context", the examples of what might constitute antisemitism include claims of [Jewish dual loyalty](/wiki/Antisemitic_tropes#Dual_loyalty "Antisemitic tropes")
,[\[96\]](#cite_note-100)
 and "claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor".[\[97\]](#cite_note-101)

### Adoption

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted for internal use by a number of government and political institutions. We need to expand on a lot of the examples to ensure that we have a legally enforceable code so that we can enforce discipline as everyone wants to."[\[152\]](#cite_note-156)

The NEC's modified examples sparked criticism amid allegations of antisemitism in the party, leading the NEC to announce that it would review the decision in consultation with the UK Jewish community.[\[153\]](#cite_note-157)
[\[147\]](#cite_note-Jewish_Chronicle-151)
 The UK Delegation to the IHRA said that modifying the IHRA-WDA or not including all 11 examples would mean it "is no longer the IHRA definition", would remove the consistency of having a single definition, and "undermines the months of international diplomacy and academic rigour that enabled this definition to exist".[\[154\]](#cite_note-158)

In September 2018, the NEC decided to add all 11 unamended examples to the definition of antisemitism; the IHRA-WDA was subsequently added to the party's standing orders by a majority vote of 205 by the [Parliamentary Labour Party](/wiki/Parliamentary_Labour_Party "Parliamentary Labour Party")
.[\[145\]](#cite_note-SabSep18-149)
[\[155\]](#cite_note-159)
[\[156\]](#cite_note-160)

Later in the month, a report by the [Media Reform Coalition](/w/index.php?title=Media_Reform_Coalition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Media Reform Coalition (page does not exist)")
 examined over 250 articles and broadcast news segments of coverage of Labour's revised code of conduct on antisemitism, and found over 90 examples of misleading or inaccurate reporting. While the announcement was welcomed by Zionist advocacy groups including [AIJAC](/wiki/AIJAC "AIJAC")
 (the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council) and the [Zionist Federation of Australia](/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Australia "Zionist Federation of Australia")
, the [New Israel Fund](/wiki/New_Israel_Fund "New Israel Fund")
 Australia and Australia Palestine Advocacy Network expressed concerns that the IHRA definition could be used to silence criticism of Israeli policies and actions.[\[110\]](#cite_note-Australia_2021-114)

On 10 July 2025, the first report of Australia's [Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism](/wiki/List_of_combating_antisemitism_envoys#Australia "List of combating antisemitism envoys")
[\[171\]](#cite_note-175)
[\[172\]](#cite_note-176)
 urged adoption of the IHRA working definition and its examples throughout Australian government and society "as best practice for identifying antisemitism". The report was welcomed by some Jewish organizations but criticized by others.[\[173\]](#cite_note-177)
[\[174\]](#cite_note-178)
 It was criticized in several quarters for a chilling of free speech particularly as to Israeli government policies, and a [Trumpian](/wiki/Trumpism "Trumpism")
 threat to the independence of universities and arts organisations.[\[175\]](#cite_note-179)
[\[176\]](#cite_note-180)
[\[177\]](#cite_note-181)
[\[178\]](#cite_note-182)
 Kenneth Stern, the definition's lead drafter, said that it would be a "disaster" for Australia to adopt the proposal to deal with antisemitism mainly by restricting speech.[\[179\]](#cite_note-183)
 The federal government has said that it will respond to the report after receiving a report from the special envoy on islamophobia, due in August, and a final report on racism in universities from the [Australian Human Rights Commission](/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission "Australian Human Rights Commission")
, due in October.[\[180\]](#cite_note-184)

##### New Zealand

On 24 June 2022, [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand")
 formally became an observer of the IHRA.[\[181\]](#cite_note-185)
 The announcement was welcomed by the [New Zealand Jewish Council](/wiki/New_Zealand_Jewish_Council "New Zealand Jewish Council")
 and the [Holocaust Centre of New Zealand](/w/index.php?title=Holocaust_Centre_of_New_Zealand&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holocaust Centre of New Zealand (page does not exist)")
 as a means of combating racism and antisemitism. In recent years, criticism of the definition has grown with critics arguing that it "primarily targets criticism of Israel and that it has been weaponized against Palestinian activists".[\[195\]](#cite_note-199)

In a statement published on 3 November 2022, 128 scholars, including leading Jewish academics at Israeli, European, United Kingdom and United States universities, said the definition has been "hijacked" and urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition due to its "divisive and polarising" effect.[\[196\]](#cite_note-200)
[\[197\]](#cite_note-201)
 As of 20 April 2023, 104 human and civil rights organisations, including [Human Rights Watch](/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch")
 and the ACLU, also urged the United Nations not to adopt the definition saying in a letter that "The IHRA definition has often been used to wrongly label criticism of Israel as antisemitic, and thus chill and sometimes suppress, non-violent protest, activism and speech critical of Israel and/or Zionism, including in the US and Europe."[\[198\]](#cite_note-202)
[\[199\]](#cite_note-203)

Criticism of the examples
-------------------------

### Academic

In March 2005, [Brian Klug](/wiki/Brian_Klug "Brian Klug")
 argued that the definition's examples proscribed legitimate criticism of the human rights record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring [criticism of Israel](/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel")
, and criticism of Israeli actions and criticism of Zionism as a political ideology into the category of antisemitism and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews.[\[200\]](#cite_note-204)

In December 2016, [David Feldman](/wiki/David_Feldman_(historian) "David Feldman (historian)")
 wrote: "I fear this definition is imprecise, and isolates antisemitism from other forms of bigotry." He also said: "The text also carries dangers. In the Judaism in which I was nurtured and educated, there is only one text whose status is sacred; and it was not written by a committee of the IHRA."[\[203\]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlug2018b-207)

In August 2018, [Rebecca Ruth Gould](/wiki/Rebecca_Ruth_Gould "Rebecca Ruth Gould")
, Professor of Islamic world and comparative literature at the [University of Birmingham](/wiki/University_of_Birmingham "University of Birmingham")
, published the first extended scholarly critique of the IHRA definition: "Legal Form and Legal Legitimacy: The IHRA Definition of Antisemitism as a Case Study in Censored Speech" in the journal _[Law, Culture and the Humanities](/wiki/Law,_Culture_and_the_Humanities "Law, Culture and the Humanities")
_."

On 26 May 2016, the IHRA Plenary adopted its [Working Definition of Antisemitism](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
, which declares: 

“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” 

The definition of antisemitism was originally drafted with the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), which worked with several prominent Jewish organizations to draft a comprehensive definition of antisemitism. However, in 2009 EUMC was replaced by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), which decided that it would not provide a definition to any form of prejudice, including antisemitism. 

Explaining the decision, then-IHRA Chair, Romanian Ambassador Mihnea Constantinescu, [stated](https://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/AntiSemitism/Pages/The-IHRA-adopts-working-definition-of-antiemitism-2-June-2016.aspx)
, “All IHRA Member Countries share the concern that incidents of antisemitism are steadily rising and agree that the IHRA’s Member Countries and indeed the IHRA’s experts need political tools with which to fight this scourge. The IHRA’s 31 member countries -- 24 of which are EU member countries -- are committed to the Stockholm Declaration and thereby to fighting the evil of antisemitism through coordinated international political action.” 

The definition includes a list of eleven reference [examples](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism)
 to aid the identification of antisemitism. Universities, municipalities, religious groups and even sports clubs are among the bodies that have formally adopted the definition thus far. 

The UN Member States that have formally endorsed or adopted IHRA Working definition of antisemitism include:

!Ihra countries <image:8520>

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has also been a strong advocate for adopting a universal definition of antisemitism, saying, “Such a definition can serve as a basis for law enforcement, as well as preventive policies.”

#### Working Definition Of Holocaust Denial And Distortion](/en/working-definition-of-holocaust-denial-and-distortion)

[Next\
\
#### IHRA and Roma Genocide Remembrance](/en/ihra-and-roma-genocide-remembrance) Some critics of the definition have claimed that by including within its examples references to Israel, it unfairly labels detractors of Israeli policy as antisemites. Defenders of the definition argue that the wording leaves room for vigorous criticism of Israel’s government as it states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic” and that it is a non-legally binding definition, intended to guide and educate without limiting debate or free speech."

**Antisemitic acts are criminal** when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

**Criminal acts are antisemitic** when the targets of attacks, whether they are people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.

**Antisemitic discrimination** is the denial to Jews of opportunities or services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

What has its impact been?

The working definition of antisemitism has brought the issue once more to the attention of leaders around the world, making them aware that much work still needs to be done to address antisemitism, which is deeply rooted in our societies.

As a result, countries and organizations have developed national and regional strategies to counter antisemitism, and have appointed Special Envoys and other advisors on the issue. [Skip to main content](#main)

In the spirit of the Stockholm Declaration that states: “With humanity still scarred by …antisemitism and xenophobia the international community shares a solemn responsibility to fight those evils” the committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial called the IHRA Plenary in Budapest 2015 to adopt the following working definition of antisemitism.

On 26 May 2016, the Plenary in Bucharest decided to:

> **Adopt the following non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism:**
> 
> **“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. <image:8527>

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

Why was the IHRA working definition of antisemitism developed?

The IHRA is the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues. Following the example of the working definition of Holocaust denial and distortion (2013), the IHRA’s experts set out to adopt a similar tool to help guide the organization’s work on combating antisemitism.

How did the IHRA adopt the working definition of antisemitism?

The experts in the IHRA’s Committee on Antisemitism and Holocaust Denial built international consensus around a non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism, which was then adopted by the Plenary, the IHRA’s decision-making body made up of representatives from all IHRA Member Countries. This practical tool has also been formally adopted or endorsed\* by these groups, both at the national and organizational level.

*   [Special Rapporteur for freedom of religion or belief Ahmed Shaheed](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/ActionPlanChanges-May2022.pdf)
     recommended that governments use the IHRA working definition of antisemitism as a non-legally binding educational and training tool and ensure it is incorporated, together with relevant human rights standards-based guidance on protecting freedom of opinion and expression, into training and educational materials for all public officials, such as police, prosecutors, and judges, government employees, educators, and national human rights institutions, and integrated into diversity inclusion programs.

Content: The IHRA working definition of antisemitism (IHRA-WDA) has been adopted by several countries and institutions. The definition includes examples of what might constitute antisemitism, including claims of Jewish dual loyalty and claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor. The examples relating to Israel have been criticized by academics who say that they are often used to weaponize antisemitism in order to stifle free speech relating to criticism of Israeli actions and policies. The UK, Israel, and Albania were among the first to adopt the definition. The article does not mention the World Jewish Congress or the assassination of JFK. <image:k> shows a map of IHRA members.

Antisemitism
============

Antisemitism, the world’s oldest hatred, is not only still felt around the world, but has been on the rise, as has the frequency of violent attacks.  

Similarly, our International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians (ICJP) forum of Jewish legislators, government ministers, and other elected officials aims to promote dialogue and collaboration between Jewish parliamentarians; to support the principles of democracy, the cause of human rights, and the rule of law; and to combat racism, antisemitism, xenophobia, terrorism, and Holocaust denial by those means available to legislators and government ministers.

**Getting your [Trinity Audio](//trinityaudio.ai)
 player ready...**

_**The following analysis was authored by the Antisemitism Research Center (ARC) by CAM:**_

On February 10th, U.S. Convinced that Jews, Zionists, or the Mossad assassinated President Kennedy, prominent antisemitic influencers such as Jake Shields, Lucas Gage, and Stew Peters framed her involvement as part of a broader Jewish conspiracy to conceal the truth.

Such claims, amplified by bots, quickly reached hundreds of millions internet users, according to a **[new data study](https://combatantisemitism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Manipulating-the-Narrative-Antisemitic-Discourse-and-Inauthentic-Engagement-Targeting-Congresswoman-Anna-Paulina-Luna.pdf)
** carried out by the Cyabra social media analytics firm and published by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), in another disturbing indication of the full extent of the prevalence of antisemitism online today.

**The Formula of Antisemitic Conspiracy Theories**

These individuals now see Luna’s task force as another example of Jewish control over historical narratives. For example, in a recent **[post](https://x.com/jakeshieldsajj/status/1889742996536524900?s=46&t=LMXebXbwXQ6y7VSq3G7x2w)
** on X, Shields shared a photo of Congresswoman Luna and Prime Minister Netanyahu during the latter’s July 2024 address to Congress, and wrote, “This is who is in charge of releasing the JFK files.”

Implicit is the claim that Congresswoman Luna cannot be trusted to lead efforts to declassify files related to the assassination of President Kennedy either because of subservience or fealty to Prime Minister Netanyahu — someone who, presumably, has a direct stake in maintaining the “secrets” of Jewish involvement in the assassination.

In addition, Shields implies that a Jew (or Zionist) always acts in the best interest of their fellow Jews or Zionists, or of Israel, at the expense of others. Invoking “[**dual loyalty**](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/conspiracy-myths/the-myth-of-dual-loyalty)
” portrays the accused as untrustworthy, and in the case of Congresswoman Luna, the purpose of the dual loyalty canard is to preemptively reject any findings she may release that do not assign blame to Jews or Israel for the assassination of President Kennedy.

Both the far-left and the far-right peddle the antisemitic conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is a “Zionist-occupied government,” or “ZOG,” and have invoked ZOG when criticizing Congresswoman Luna and her Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Far-right antisemitic influencer Stew Peters [**asked**](https://x.com/redpillsayian/status/1890234850696888707?s=12)
 rhetorically, “why should we trust a Jewish stripper \[Congresswoman Luna\] to tell us about the crimes of our occupied government.” Meanwhile, the seemingly far-left X account “AIPAC Tracker” **[posted](https://x.com/TrackAIPAC/status/1891914590776168587)
**, “6/7 of the members of the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets are in the pocket of the Israel lobby.” Unified by their shared antisemitism in the form of alleging outsize “Zionist” control of the United States, the two ends of the political spectrum seemingly mirror each other, reflecting a phenomenon known as the “[**horseshoe theory**](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/3246)
.”

Not only is Congresswoman Luna allegedly controlled by Zionists, but she is compromised because she is, supposedly, secretly Jewish. These tactics serve to undermine her credibility and reinforce the longstanding antisemitic trope that Jews, or those aligned with them, manipulate governments to serve their interests.

**Instances of Antisemitism Online Targeting Congresswoman Luna:**

Labeling Congresswoman Luna as either a Jew or a Zionist serves the same end: to portray her as compromised and controlled by Jewish or Zionist puppet-masters. In a matter of days, a handful of antisemitic social media accounts can create a false narrative that receives millions of views.

Only by exposing the predictability of their conspiracy theories and their illogical nature can social media users, especially [**younger users**](https://x.com/davidshor/status/1888287606942625864?s=12)
, be inoculated from the societal disease that is antisemitism.

Claim: "The World Jewish Congress (WJC) has amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism in March 2025 to include: 'Conflating the assassination of JFK to jews/israel'."

## Actions
```
web_search("World Jewish Congress IHRA antisemitism definition")
web_search("World Jewish Congress JFK antisemitism")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The IHRA working definition of antisemitism, adopted on May 26, 2016, includes examples such as making allegations about Jews, denying the Holocaust, and applying double standards to Israel. The definition has been adopted by several countries and institutions. The World Jewish Congress (WJC) provides the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.

The provided sources do not mention any amendment to the definition by the WJC, nor do they mention the assassination of JFK.


### Evidence from `web_search`
The World Jewish Congress website discusses combating antisemitism and related conspiracy myths, including articles from 2025. The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study on March 6, 2025, discussing how antisemitic conspiracy theorists use online platforms to spread hate, specifically in relation to the assassination of JFK. The study mentions Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and includes examples of antisemitic posts and conspiracy theories.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the World Jewish Congress (WJC) provides the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, there is no mention of the WJC amending the definition in March 2025 to include the assassination of JFK. The Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study in March 2025 discussing antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the JFK assassination, but this does not indicate an amendment to the IHRA definition by the WJC.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence indicates that the World Jewish Congress (WJC) has not amended the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism to include the assassination of JFK. While the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) published a study in March 2025 discussing antisemitic conspiracy theories related to the JFK assassination, this does not confirm the claim.

`false`

Khalil’s legal team:**

“The world now knows ICE unconstitutionally arrested Mahmoud in retaliation for his defense of Palestinian rights and lives," said **Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR**. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) false assertions to the immigration court that he attempted to flee arrest,” said **Johnny Sinodis who, with his partner Marc Van Der Hout, is representing Mahmoud Khalil in his immigration proceedings.** “The egregious conduct of ICE in not only conducting this illegal arrest, but also lying about the circumstances to Mr. Explore Case.](https://www.aclu.org/cases/khalil-v-trump)

“They want to conflate any speech for the rights of Palestinians with speech that’s supporting terrorism, which is totally wrong,” he said.

“It’s a message that they want to make an example out of me, even if you are a legal resident… that we will find a way to come after you, to punish you, if you speak, against what we want.”

Khalil told the Associated Press that if his claim against the Trump administration is successful, he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in Trump’s “failed” effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech. CNN has previously reported that the ICE agents [did not have a warrant](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-news-update)

Mahmoud Khalil describes conditions at ICE detention facility

01:24

CNN  — 

Detained for more than 100 days without charge, and with the threat of deportation looming over him, Palestinian student activist [Mahmoud Khalil](https://cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 was convinced he would eventually prevail.

In an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Khalil, who is now back with his young family, describes the months languishing in a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, and the pain of being denied permission to be present at his son’s birth.

“It was a very, very dehumanizing experience, for someone who was not accused of any crime, whatsoever,” said Khalil, a green card holder who had no formal criminal or civil charges brought against him.

His detention sparked outrage across the US.

On Thursday Khalil’s lawyers [filed a claim](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-lawsuit-trump-administration)
 against the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned, prosecuted and portrayed as antisemitic as the government sought to deport him over his role in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. The 30-year-old, who was born in a refugee camp in Syria before going on to graduate from Columbia, had played a prominent role negotiating on behalf of pro-Palestinian protesters at the university.

Once taken, he was moved first to New Jersey, then to Texas, and finally to an ICE detention center in Louisiana – more than 1,000 miles away from his wife, a US citizen, who was then eight months pregnant.

“I was literally moved from one place to another, like an object,” he recalled, referring to his [transfers](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/19/us/mahmoud-khalil-palestinian-activist-trump)
 to different detention facilities. “I was shackled all the time,” he said.

But, he said, the days in the detention center never broke his spirit.

“From the moment that I was detained, I knew that I would eventually prevail,” he said.

“What I simply did is protesting a genocide.”

Israel has repeatedly pushed back against claims its war in Gaza is a genocide.

Protesters rally in support of detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil in March in New York.

The food in the ICE center in Louisiana was nearly “inedible,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security in a statement called Khalil’s claim “absurd.”

His arrest outside his apartment on Columbia University’s campus in New York City in March, as he returned home from a dinner with his wife, felt like a “kidnap,” he told Amanpour.

Plainclothes agents had followed him into the lobby of his building, and threatened his wife with arrest if she didn’t separate from him, he said. His lawyers have vehemently pushed back on that assertion.

After accusing him – without evidence – of being a Hamas sympathizer, the Trump administration, who sought Khalil’s [deportation](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/us/mahmoud-khalil-columbia-university-israel-hnk/index.html)
, said it was [justified](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-green-card-trump-administration)
 because he did not reveal connections to two organizations in his application to become a permanent US resident. After being served meat that made him vomit, he switched to vegetarian options, he said.

The center was bitterly cold, but repeated requests for blankets were ignored, he said.

“The moment you enter such ICE facilities, your rights literally stay outside,” he told Amanpour.

CNN has previously reached out to ICE for comment about the conditions at its Louisiana facilities – its policies indicate detention is non-punitive. The GEO Group, the corporation that runs the facility where Khalil was held, has denied allegations of abuse.

The Trump administration has argued that Khalil’s actions pose a threat to its foreign policy goal of combatting antisemitism. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration’s deportation policies.

‘I couldn’t hold him’
---------------------

Amid the inedible food, the cold, and fear he might be deported, one moment stood out as the hardest to bear – immigration officials denying him permission to be present at the birth of his firstborn child.

Attorneys for Khalil in May said officials at the Louisiana center cited a “blanket no-contact visitation policy” and unspecified security concerns as part of their reason to deny the request.

“Missing the birth of my child."

Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?
==========================================================================

20 June 2025

Phil McCauslandBBC News, New York

! On 20 June, a judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released.

Born in Syria, the Columbia graduate's arrest by immigration agents was linked to Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of "un-American activity".

Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. They accused the government of "open repression of student activism and political speech".

Mr Khalil's arrest was the highest-profile in Trump's crackdown on international student protesters, as video of his arrest whipped around social media and the birth of his first child in April, which he was still detained, made international headlines.

Khalil's work for UK in Middle East
-----------------------------------

Born in Syria to Palestinian refugees, Mr Khalil earned a degree in computer science from the Lebanese American University before working with the Syrian-American non-profit Jusoor.

More recently, he managed the Syria Chevening Programme for the British Embassy in Beirut, offering scholarships for study in the UK, according to his biography on the Society for International Development website.

The UK Foreign Office said Mr Khalil stopped work there more than two years ago.

Mr Khalil moved to the US in 2022, where he earned a master's degree at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. <image:8670>!Getty Images Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil talks to the press during the press briefing organized by Pro-Palestinian protesters who set up a new encampment at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus <image:8673>Getty Images

Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. <image:8670>!Getty Images A protester in New York City with green hair and sunglasses holds up a sign that reads: "RELEASE MAHMOUD" <image:8671>Getty Images

Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests at Columbia University in the spring of 2024, has drawn global attention after the Trump administration arrested and moved to deport him.

The case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.

Mr Khalil was held in an immigration facility in Louisiana for three months before a federal judge ruled that President Donald Trump could no longer detain or deport him. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".

The 30-year-old's lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.

Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.

After Mr Khalil's arrest the Department of Homeland Security accused him of "leading activities aligned to Hamas" but did not provide further details.

The White House alleged that he had organised protests where pro-Hamas propaganda was distributed. And activists say they fear the Trump administration will continue to target protesters who are not US citizens.

Legal experts say green card holders can be deported on national security grounds, but add that the case against Mr Khalil is unprecedented.

"Targeting individual protesters just for protesting... is highly unusual and something that we haven't seen before, even under the first Trump administration," said Jacob Hamburger, a visiting assistant professor at Cornell Law School.

Khalil had been briefly suspended from Columbia
-----------------------------------------------

Watch: The BBC speaks to Columbia student after suspension

Amid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.

At the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.

It is unclear when he obtained his green card, which provides permanent residency.

"\[They said\] that after reviewing the evidence, they don't have any evidence to suspend (me)," he said in an interview in early May. From then until mid-June he was held by immigration authorities on two charges.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue Mr Khalil's presence in the US could pose "potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences".

In early June, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz [ruled Rubio's justification for detaining](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd28em88ezo)
 Mr Khalil was likely unconstitutional and said the US government could not detain or deport a legal US resident under that reasoning.

Attorneys for the Trump administration then said Mr Khalil was being held for a different reason, failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024.

But on 20 June, Judge Farbiarz ordered him to be released on bail.

The White House maintains the judge did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release and said they plan to appeal.

Former President Donald J. Trump’s strong support for Israel has been central to his campaign, highlighting past achievements like relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, and brokering the Abraham Accords, but polls show that reoccupation of the Gaza Strip would be a far less popular policy among Israelis and American supporters of the Jewish state.

In the interview, Hewitt asked Trump if Gaza could be transformed into a prosperous area like Monaco. The remark came during a conversation with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, which marked the anniversary of the October 7 attacks by Hamas. Trump, the Republican nominee in this year’s US presidential election, claimed in a recent radio interview that he had visited Gaza, a war-torn region he has never officially been recorded visiting. When asked for clarification, a campaign aide asserted that Gaza is “in Israel” and noted that Trump had visited Israel.

The Gaza Strip, under Hamas control since 2007, is not claimed by Israel, though it was under Israeli military administration from 1967 to 2005. Despite some Israeli calls for its annexation, Gaza remains distinct, separated from Israel and the West Bank. Trump responded, “It could be better than Monaco. You know when—I’ve been there, and it’s rough.”

The Gaza Strip is not part of Israel and has never been, though some Israelis have called for annexing it. In 2007, after Hamas took over Gaza, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade that restricted access to the area.

There is no record of Mr. Trump ever being in Gaza, during his time as president or as a businessman. Trump visited Israel and traveled to the West Bank — a separate territory that is some 20 miles from Gaza at the nearest point — for a meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in Bethlehem.

### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 7, 2024, Donald Trump was interviewed by Hugh Hewitt. During the interview, Trump stated that he had been to Gaza. The transcript of the interview can be found here: [Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hugh-hewitt-radio-october-7-2024).

However, reports from The Media Line ([Source](https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/ex-president-trump-misstates-gaza-visit-in-hugh-hewitt-interview/)) and The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-gaza-israel.html)) indicate that Trump did not visit Gaza, but visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017. <image:332>, <image:333>, <image:k>


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, "I’ve been there" regarding Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that Trump did not visit Gaza. He visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate as Trump made the statement, but factually incorrect as he did not visit Gaza.

On October 7, 2024, Donald Trump was interviewed by Hugh Hewitt. During the interview, Trump stated that he had been to Gaza. The transcript of the interview can be found here: [Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hugh-hewitt-radio-october-7-2024).

However, reports from The Media Line ([Source](https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/ex-president-trump-misstates-gaza-visit-in-hugh-hewitt-interview/)) and The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-gaza-israel.html)) indicate that Trump did not visit Gaza, but visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017. <image:332>, <image:333>, <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, "I’ve been there" regarding Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that Trump did not visit Gaza. He visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate as Trump made the statement, but factually incorrect as he did not visit Gaza.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially accurate because Donald Trump did make the statement in the interview. However, it is factually inaccurate because he did not visit Gaza.

`false`

[Israeli airstrike on Yemeni capital](/en/news/326785/israeli-airstrike-on-yemeni-capital "[28 Aug 2025 18:30] 
News sources have reported a massive Israeli airstrike on Sanaa, the capital of Yemen. Including Nasser's victims, the total number of journalists, cameramen, and media workers killed since the start of Israel's military invasion of Gaza in October 2023 has reached 244. This incident shows the continuation of the trend of targeting journalists in Gaza and highlights the importance of the legal, media, and international response.

1\. The continuation of this trend threatens the lives and careers of journalists and the ability of the international community to access independent information and pursue legal action.

Despite all these crimes and casualties, the voice of the oppressed people of Gaza and Palestine has not and will not be silenced. The voices of witnesses and the narrative of truth, despite the dangers, will now resonate more strongly, louder and more clearly than ever before.

The final message: The world cannot and must not remain silent; urgent support, careful documentation and international pressure are the key to protecting journalists and continuing the flow of truth in Gaza and Palestine.

The names of the last 50 Palestinian martyrs

A list of the 50 Palestinian journalists who were martyred during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025, corresponding to 3 September, is presented as follows:

1\. Ibrahim Muhareb

12\. Asaad Shamlakh

21\. Mohammed Imad Labad

27\. Hisham al-Nawajha

36\."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.avapress.com/en/article/326644/the-voice-will-not-be-silenced): 
Content: The Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) published an article on August 27, 2025, reporting on an Israeli airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis that killed 4 journalists and cameramen. The article is titled "The voice will not be silenced!" <image:32> The article also mentions a list of 50 Palestinian journalists who were martyred during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is associated with an article about an Israeli airstrike. The article, published on August 27, 2025, by the Afghan Voice Agency (AVA), discusses an airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis. The article also mentions the deaths of 50 Palestinian journalists during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025.

The evidence does not provide information about the baby in the image, Sham Imad Muhareb, or the circumstances of her injuries. The evidence does not confirm or deny the claim that the baby did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike in April 2025.

To verify the claim, additional information is needed about the baby's identity, the nature of her injuries, and the events surrounding the alleged airstrike.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://www.avapress.com/en/article/326644/the-voice-will-not-be-silenced): 
Content: The Afghan Voice Agency (AVA) published an article on August 27, 2025, reporting on an Israeli airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis that killed 4 journalists and cameramen. The article is titled "The voice will not be silenced!" <image:32> The article also mentions a list of 50 Palestinian journalists who were martyred during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is associated with an article about an Israeli airstrike. The article, published on August 27, 2025, by the Afghan Voice Agency (AVA), discusses an airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis. The article also mentions the deaths of 50 Palestinian journalists during the Gaza war as of August 25, 2025.

The evidence does not provide information about the baby in the image, Sham Imad Muhareb, or the circumstances of her injuries. The evidence does not confirm or deny the claim that the baby did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike in April 2025.

 _to see ISW-CTP's interactive map showing the total strikes in Iran since June 12, as well as an interactive timelapse showing the strikes day-by-day._

**_CTP and ISW temporarily refocused the Iran Update to cover the Israel-Iran War. The militias’ political wings inaccurately portrayed US self-defense strikes on militia positions in Iraq between October 2023 and February 2024 as ”violations” of Iraqi sovereignty to pressure the Iraqi federal government to remove US forces form Iraq, for example.\[8\]

Iranian-backed Badr Organization member Moeen al Kadhimi stated that Iraq must become militarily self-sufficient and called on the Iraqi government to review contracts with partners, including Russia, to purchase advanced air defense systems.\[9\] State of Law Coalition member Mohammed Hassan Radi al Shammari called on the Iraqi Foreign Affairs Ministry on June 17 to diversify Iraq’s arms supplies and modernize its air defense systems.\[10\] Badr Organization member Mahdi Taqi Amerli similarly called on the Iraqi federal government on June 18 to rapidly develop air defense capabilities to prevent US and Israeli freedom of operation in Iraqi airspace.\[11\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba called on the Iraqi government on June 19 to permit the PMF to establish a no-fly zone over Iraqi airspace for US and Israeli aircraft and permit the PMF to intercept Israeli jets or missiles that enter Iraqi airspace.\[12\]

**The Sudani administration has continued to engage US-led International Coalition and NATO in Iraq despite pressure from Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia actors to end these partnerships.** Iraqi National Security Adviser Qassem al Araji and Iraqi Interior Minister Abdul Amir Shammari held separate meetings with the commander of NATO Mission Iraq (NMI), Major General Christophe Hintzy, on June 25 and 26 to discuss planning and capacity-building programs for the Iraqi Security Forces.\[13\] Araji reaffirmed Iraq’s interest in building a long-term partnership with NMI.\[14\] International military coalitions like NMI and Operation Inherent Resolve support the Iraqi Security Forces in a non-combat role through intelligence, logistics, training, and equipment to enable Iraqi counter-ISIS operations.

The political wings of these militias attempted to pressure Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani to adopt policies which would restrict US and Israeli freedom to operate in Iraqi airspace, but these efforts focused on long-term solutions like air defense acquisition or symbolic measures in parliament. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias threatened to launch an attack campaign targeting US forces in the region if the United States entered the Israel-Iran War, but they did not conduct a well-coordinated or major campaign compared to their attacks on US forces during the October 7 War.\[3\] Multiple militias condemned US and Israeli strikes in Iran, but did not claim any attacks. Militia leadership may also have allowed fighters to conduct the attacks without publicly sanctioning the attacks.

**Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia actors exerted political pressure on Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al Sudani to adopt policies that would restrict US and Israeli freedom to operate in Iraqi airspace.** Iraqi parliamentarians, primarily members of the loosely aligned pro-Iranian Shia Coordination Framework, held a “consultative” session on June 17 to express solidarity with Iran and call on the Iraqi federal government to take measures to end Israeli violations of Iraqi airspace.\[5\] Parliament failed to meet the quorum necessary for an extraordinary session on June 17, with only 140 parliamentarians in attendance out of a total of 329 parliamentarians.\[6\] Quorum requires at least two-thirds majority, or 220 parliamentarians, to be present to hold a session. Protesters demonstrated in Baghdad and Khadimiya on June 21 in solidarity with Iran following calls from Shia nationalist cleric Moqtada al Sadr and other Shia politicians to protest Israeli operations in the Middle East.\[7\] Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have previously leveraged their political wings to advance policies favorable to the militias. Abboud is affiliated with State of Law Coalition head Nouri al Maliki and the Iranian-backed Badr Organization.\[21\] The Council, which is led by Zaidan.\[22\] The Federal Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Council have had previous conflicts, including when the Supreme Judicial Council rejected a Federal Supreme Court decision in February 2025.\[23\] An unspecified court official told Western media on July 1 that Sudani and Parliament Speaker Mahmoud al Mashhadani rejected Abboud’s requests for the Iraqi federal government to discuss the dispute with legal and constitutional experts.\[24\] Abboud submitted his resignation, citing “health concerns,” on June 23.\[25\] Sudani nominated Deputy President of the Court of Cassation, Ibrahim Hussein, to replace Abboud on June 30.\[26\]

**Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced on June 29 that it could disqualify candidates involved in electoral fraud from participating in the November 2025 parliamentary elections.**\[27\] IHEC began vetting candidate lists on June 27 after the candidate registration period closed on June 26.\[28\] This announcement comes after various actors have leveled electoral fraud and corruption accusations against Shia Coordination Framework members, including members of Sudani’s electoral coalition.\[29\] The Shia Coordination Framework is a loose coalition of Shia political parties, some of which Iran backs."

What Israel wants
-----------------

For its part, Israel worries about the possible emergence of a radical Islamist government in Damascus and creeping Turkish influence along its border. And while Tel Aviv has seemingly come to terms with Ankara's heavy involvement in _northern_ Syria—particularly in Kurdish areas—it appears to have drawn a red line regarding Turkish military presence in _other_ parts of the country.

Moreover, Israel has not yet decided whether it prefers a strong centralised government in Damascus or a weak and fractured state, although recent statements and actions suggest a preference for the latter. Its final calculus will likely be shaped by Washington's position, but regardless, given its demonstrated military superiority in recent months, Israel will want to play a key role in shaping Syria’s future.

“There are technical contacts to prevent combat elements from misunderstanding each other,” Fidan continued, adding that technical teams are communicating “when needed.”

Fidan told Reuters last Friday, “We don’t want to see any confrontation with Israel in Syria because Syria belongs to Syrians.” He argued that repeated Israeli strikes were eroding the new government’s ability to deter threats from enemies, including the Islamic State terror group.

A senior Israeli official told the Ynet news site that during a Wednesday night security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu told ministers that Israel was not seeking a confrontation with Turkey in Syria but would not hesitate to act if necessary to defend itself.

The prime minister added that he would request assistance from US President Donald Trump if needed, given Trump’s amiable relationship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

! The US president, speaking alongside Netanyahu during the premier’s White House visit, said negotiations could be helped by the president’s “great relations” with Erdogan, whom he said he likes very much and called “very smart.”

Netanyahu voiced Israeli concerns over Turkish influence in Syria while touting the US president as a mediator.

“We’ve had neighborly relations with Turkey that have deteriorated, and we don’t want to see Syria being used by anyone, including Turkey, as a base for attack in Israel,” he said.

“We discussed how we can avoid this conflict in a variety of ways, and I think we can’t have a better interlocutor than the president of the United States for this purpose,” Netanyahu added.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, shakes hands with Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa during their meeting at the presidential palace in Ankara, Turkey, February 4, 2025. The talks were aimed at preventing unwanted incidents as both countries’ militaries operate in the country.

“Under the direction of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a political-security delegation led by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi, and with the participation of senior representatives of the Defense Ministry and the security branches, met last night with a parallel Turkish delegation,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement.

The PMO thanked Azerbaijan and its President Ilham Aliyev for “hosting the important talks,” and added that during the meeting, “each side presented its interests in the region, and agreed to continue the path of dialogue in order to maintain security stability.”

Israel “made it unequivocally clear that any change in the deployment of foreign forces in Syria, in particular the establishment of Turkish bases in the Palmyra (Tadmor) area, is a red line,” an Israeli official told media on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Israel made it clear that preventing any such activity “is the responsibility of the government in Damascus. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco, File)

Israel has accused Turkey of trying to turn Syria into a Turkish protectorate, and Ankara has slammed Israeli military activity in the country following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. Reuters reported last week that Turkish military teams reviewed at least three air bases in Syria where they might deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact, before Israel hit the sites with airstrikes, rendering them unusable.

An Israeli source told Channel 12 news Wednesday that “a mechanism will be established, similar to the one built between Israel and Russia.” The two countries [established a hotline](https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-israel-hotline-to-prevent-aerial-clashes-in-syria/)
 to avoid clashes between their air forces, as Israel worked to prevent Iran from gaining a military foothold in the country and Russia provided military support for the Bashar regime in ending the country’s civil war.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told CNN Turk Wednesday that Turkey and Israel had been holding talks on the matter “when needed.”

“While we are conducting certain operations in Syria, there needs to be a deconfliction mechanism with Israel, which flies aircraft in that region, similar to mechanisms we have with the US and Russia,” Fidan said.

### Airbase strikes

On Saturday, Reuters reported that Turkey [scoped out at least three airbases](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 in Syria where it could deploy forces as part of a planned joint defense pact that could see new Turkish bases in central Syria and the use of Syria’s airspace, before Israel hit the sites. (Turkish Presidency via AP)

### International mediation

Both Azerbaijan and the US have offered to mediate between the two countries.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev has referenced his country’s past role in facilitating Israeli-Turkish ties and said this week that “both countries are close friends of Azerbaijan.”

“I think, despite the legitimate concerns and the quite high level of mistrust, there can still be found grounds for normalization and areas of mutual interest,” he said at the annual ADA University Policy Forum in Baku.

‘Everything would be fine if It weren’t for the Palestinian question’

Turkey: wanting to have it both ways on Israel
==============================================

Though longstanding allies, Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has grown increasingly critical of Israel’s actions towards the Palestinians, but without renouncing Ankara’s broader strategic interests.

There was a message from Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in a speech posted on X on 30 March on the occasion of the Eid al-Fitr prayer marking the end of Ramadan: ‘We see and we know what’s happening in Palestine. Turkey’s economic success – that year it ranked 17th in the world in terms of GDP and achieved a 6% growth rate ([1](/2025/05/02turkey#nb1 "According to the International Monetary Fund.")
) – boosted its prestige in the Arab world, as did its ability to combine Islam and democracy.

So when the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Ankara sought to take advantage of that prestige to reshape the Middle East through an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, which had come to power in Egypt and seemed likely to do the same in Syria, or so Turkey hoped. If Ankara requested a no-fly zone in the north of Syria or took charge of the air space, it would be seen as a casus belli by the Israeli prime minister, who intends to maintain freedom to carry out airstrikes there and in Iran Player in current talks on Syria

Between the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and Iran, Turkey was becoming a key site for Mossad as it looked to recruit. The Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 therefore came just as Turkey was preparing to normalise relations with Israel.

Erdoğan did not condemn the attack and rejected the use of the term ‘terrorist’, describing Hamas as a ‘group of freedom \[fighters\] who are striving to protect their lands’ ([2](/2025/05/02turkey#nb2 "Gabriel Gavin, ‘Mediator no more: Erdoğan takes aim at Israel, backing Hamas (…)")
). As activists who denounce government’s ‘hypocrisy’ acknowledge, ‘he’s doing our work for us.’ A significant part of Turkish public opinion – 45% view Hamas favourably ([3](/2025/05/02turkey#nb3 "Lena Argiri, ‘Greece makes strides in global fight against antisemitism, (…)")
) – is calling for an end to trade ties with Israel.

By demanding sanctions against Tel Aviv at the same time as the closing of an American radar station at Kürecik used by the Israelis and even for Turkish troops to be sent to Gaza, the New Welfare Party (YRP) led by Fatih Erbakan (the son of Erdoğan’s former mentor) is gaining a growing following – including within AKP ranks. Basically,’ explains Henri Barkey, emeritus professor of international relations at Lehigh University (Pennsylvania), ‘Israel and Turkey find themselves in similar situations in Syria. And political scientist Halil Karaveli believes an independent Rojava – a currently autonomous Kurdish enclave in the northeast of Syria – is all the more of a headache for Turkey given that it could ‘provide Israel with a strategic ally at the crossroads of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Levant’. That is something which would conclusively render null and void the Turkish diplomats’ maxim, ‘Everything would be fine with Israel were it not for the Palestinian question.’

Turkey, which had a large Jewish community, recognised the state of Israel as early as 1949, ahead of all other Muslim-majority countries. And Turkey’s generals admired the Israeli army: Jenkins highlights the enthusiasm of Turkish National Security Council secretary-general Doğan Bayazıt, who envied ‘the closeness of the Israeli army to the people’ and its ‘leading role in society’."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

Content: "We do not allow their planes to enter our airspace,” Fidan said.

The Turkish foreign minister’s condemnation comes amid years of increasingly tense relations between the two countries, said Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar.

“It’s not only about the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding in Gaza; Turkiye gradually is perceiving Israel as a national security threat,” Serdar explained, noting that Israel’s expansionism and attacks across the wider Middle East have been cause for concern.

In Syria particularly, Ankara has accused Israel of [wilfully undermining](/news/2025/8/13/turkiye-slams-israel-kurdish-led-sdf-for-destabilising-syria)
 the country’s recovery efforts after the devastation of a 14-year civil war and the removal of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad last December by a lightning rebel offensive.

“Diplomats in Ankara are seeing that if Israel is not stopped, eventually there might be a direct military confrontation between these two countries,” he said.

Serdar added that the Turkish foreign minister’s comments also show that Turkiye is looking to the Global South and other powers to take action, amid the United States’ and European Union’s largely unwavering support for Israel.

Turkish media reported last week that a ban on maritime traffic linked to Israel had been imposed, although there was no official statement. In 2023, the two countries carried out $7bn in trade.

Ankara has not minced its words about Israel’s war on Gaza, with [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](/news/2025/2/28/erdogan-says-pkk-leaders-call-to-disband-a-historic-opportunity)
 calling it a genocide – like many other world leaders and leading human rights organistions – and likening Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the leader of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler.

“We have completely cut off our trade with Israel. More and more countries and companies have decided to stop their business with Israel.”

Last November, Turkish authorities denied permission for Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s plane to enter Turkiye’s airspace for a trip to an international summit in Azerbaijan.

“As Turkiye, we have to take a stance on certain issues,” Erdogan later said when asked about the incident.

Israel and Turkiye’s relationship had soured as far back as 2010, following Israel’s deadly attack on a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, which killed 10 Turkish citizens.

More recently, a Turkish-American activist, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed by Israeli forces during a protest in the occupied West Bank in September 2024.

Turkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan giving a speech at the Grand National Assembly of Turkiye \[AFP\]

Published On 29 Aug 202529 Aug 2025

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country has completely severed economic and trade ties with Israel and has closed its airspace to its aircraft, in protest over the war in Gaza.

Speaking at an extraordinary session of the Turkish parliament on [Gaza](/news/liveblog/2025/8/29/live-israel-2)
 on Friday, Fidan said Israel has been “committing genocide in Gaza for the past two years, ignoring basic humanitarian values right before the world’s eyes”.

Turkiye cut off direct trade ties with Israel in May last year, demanding a permanent ceasefire and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza. According to reports, Israeli vessels were banned from docking in Turkiye, and Turkish-flagged ships were not allowed to enter Israeli ports.

‘Like pariahs’
--------------

Meanwhile, Turkiye’s latest move is making “more and more Israelis feel the disadvantages of this kind of war that has no deadline”, said Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst.

“Turkiye is not just another country that is deciding to cut its relationship with Israel. We do not allow Turkish ships to go to Israeli ports. Turkiye has been an ally of Israel for many years, a very important market to Israeli goods,” Eldar told Al Jazeera, speaking from Kiryat Shmona, adding that it was also a favourite summer destination for many Israelis.

“We feel more and more … Israelis are feeling isolated and \[like\] pariahs."

One article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:8782>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:8800>. It also mentions a meeting between Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8785>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:8800>.

Another article from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) also mentions the meeting between Erdogan and al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8834>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. An article from mondediplo.com ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Erdogan made statements against Israel in March 2025. Specifically, on March 30, 2025, he called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

The evidence does mention that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). Also, the Haaretz article discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)).

The claim is not directly supported by the evidence, as it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: "“With some international and local powers now adopting federal or decentralized models, Israel believes the time is right to apply military pressure to consolidate this model, particularly in the south, as a first step toward sharing influence and ensuring secure borders to strengthen influence in the northeast with the Syrian Defense Forces.”

Aware of the [fragility](https://snhr.org/blog/2025/03/11/803-individuals-extrajudicially-killed-between-march-6-10-2025/)
 that Sharaa’s government faces from the multiplicity of actors vying for control, however, Turkey has worked to strengthen the central government by using its own political card with Kurdish political factions to try to bring a close to any fragmentation of the Syrian state, even if it sees Erdogan drop a long held ideological mainstay.

Underlining Ankara’s seriousness, the first foreign visit to Syria after the fall of Assad came from Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in December. A host of other investors are practically [salivating](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/too-good-be-true-investors-eye-syria-after-trump-sanctions-move-2025-05-14/)
 to bring money back into the country.

Sharaa enjoyed a lavish Gulf tour, “living his best life,” as some commentators [noted](https://x.com/ragipsoylu/status/1929128687913390571?s=46&t=jkJlaUvTKeCtY4AcNtnlqQ)
.

In the high of the moment, and after repeated encounters with the Americans and mixed signals from the Israelis, Sharaa misread the messages and thought he was greenlit to take control of all of Suwayda, the city tucked away in the country’s south with a population predominantly made up of Druze, according to multiple sources.

And thus in just a few weeks’ time, Sharaa’s high of highs came crashing back to the earth.

On July 11, [clashes](https://www.syriahr.com/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7/769601/)
 broke out between Bedouin tribesmen and Druze figures on the Damascus-Suwayda road. “I believe that it is still a little early to talk about the dissolution of the forces in Syria because we have one demand, which is the establishment of a decentralized authority for the Kurds in northern Syria,” the SDF military commander says. 

Nearly three months after the agreement was signed, Turkey’s [patience](https://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/290520251)
 was wearing thin.

In a meeting between Sharaa and Erdogan on May 24, the two sides discussed the formulation of a common vision to end “the ongoing threat” posed by the Kurdish forces to Syria’s territorial integrity and Turkey’s national security, through direct field and security coordination, says the source close to the Turkish president.

Speaking after a round of technical talks in Baku in April between the Turkish and Israeli negotiating teams, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan tried to downplay what was on everyone’s mind.

With a shake of a hand in the Saudi capital of Riyadh in mid May, Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa completed his political transformation.

Gone was the man who once had an American [bounty](https://x.com/DigitalOutreach/status/862320076241993730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E862320076241993730%7Ctwgr%5E7104739bc23ce28a874a34d36e623f1bbb993594%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeastmonitor.com%2F20170511-dead-or-alive-us-offers-10-million-for-syria-rebel-commander%2F)
 of US$10 million on his head. Government troops have been shown to have been [implicated](https://x.com/suwayda24/status/1954520917066821658)
 in extrajudicial killings, often [filming](https://www.reuters.com/world/how-syrian-attackers-killed-one-hand-gun-another-camera-2025-07-29/)
 the attacks as threatening messages to those who don’t fall in line.

By July 16, Israel [began](https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250716-israel-launches-heavy-airstrikes-in-damascus-vowing-to-protect-druze)
 bombing Syrian forces in Suwayda, declaring that they would protect the religious minority from the overreach of the new government. For one regional diplomat, it is clear that Syria’s future is tied to a broader regional plan that is being negotiated in parallel, between Jordan, Lebanon, Gaza and the Gulf, and it is the United States and Israel that are in the driver’s seat.

In recent months, Mada Masr has spoken to regional diplomats, sources from Turkey and political actors across Syria to understand the fight to secure the position of architect of the New Syria from foreign parties and local actors alike.

\*\*\*

Almost as quickly as the fixtures of the old Syria began to crumble late last year did Israel, the spearhead of the broader plan for a New Middle East around which the US and several Gulf countries have gathered, begin to assert itself. 

On December 8, hours after Assad was forced out of the country, the Israeli military moved into the buffer zone between the occupied Golan Heights and Syria, which was created by the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement between the two countries.

“Together with the defense minister, and with full backing from the Cabinet, I directed the IDF yesterday to take control of the buffer zone and the dominant positions near it,” Netanyahu said while visiting the occupied Golan Heights on December 8, [announcing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rAVMUoZWa0)
 that the 1974 deal had “collapsed.”

[! Satellite imagery [shows](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/31/world/middleeast/israel-border-military-outposts-syria-lebanon-border.html)
 that they have also built watchtowers, prefabricated housing modules, roads and communication infrastructure throughout the buffer zone. <image:8867>](https://www.madamasr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/syria-map-edited-w_suwayda-spelling-correct.jpg)

Map of Israel’s projected influence in the south of Syria

In addition to bombing more than 500 sites across Syria, including the [capital](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2025/05/israel-used-12-aircraft-in-its-raids-on-syria/)
 of Damascus and the [port](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx808q7lrno)
 of Latakia, Israel also began to expand its ground invasion into the Daraa countryside, to create a new 15 kilometer security zone. As the pace of the Israeli attacks continued unabated after the ouster of Assad, several diplomatic pathways emerged, the most public of which have been the [talks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-israel-have-begun-talks-avoid-clashes-syria-turkish-sources-say-2025-04-10/)
 between Turkey and Israel in the Azerbaijani capital Baku aimed at creating a “technical mechanism” to reduce “unwanted incidents” in Syria.

According to a former Syrian diplomat, the Israeli attacks in the south of Syria are in part driven by a concern about Turkey’s potential influence near Israeli-held territory.

“After Iran’s withdrawal from Syria, Turkey is looking to fill the vacuum by striking understandings with the new leadership in Damascus,” the diplomat says."

## Claim
Claim: "Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025."

## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:8782>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:8800>. It also mentions a meeting between Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8785>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:8800>.

Another article from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) also mentions the meeting between Erdogan and al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8834>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. An article from mondediplo.com ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

The dénouement of Bashar al-Assad’s rule in late 2024 did not mark the end of Syria’s fragmentation. Turkey and Israel, for instance, impose authority over selected territories without openly claiming them; the resulting spheres of governance more closely resemble imperial protectorates than classical foreign military occupations, thereby reconstituting the region’s constitutional and geopolitical boundaries without invoking outright annexation.

**Conclusion: Controlled disintegration as doctrine**

If the Syrian model is reproduced, the region may enter an era in which weaker states function as laboratories for informal empire and diplomacy is replaced by strategic classification. In addition to her academic roles, she serves as the Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of the Middle East, where she plays a pivotal role in advocating for the Armenian Genocide and regional issues.

    August 22, 2025
    

Within these zones, Ankara has inserted substitutive governance networks, dispersing gendarmeries, judge panels and municipal advisory bodies that are underpinned by Turkish parliamentary appropriations. The cornerstone of its strategy rests on the covert bolstering of non-state proxies—predominantly Druze militias stationed in southern Syria and select Kurdish units positioned in the northeast—in order to prevent a hostile power, especially Iran or a revived Syrian army, from re-establishing comprehensive control over the territory.

Israeli airstrikes persistently target Iranian military installations, while discreet diplomatic engagement fosters ties with Syrian and regional actors whose security orientations broadly coincide with Israeli requirements. Accordingly, the reconfiguration of Syria’s political order will hinge as much upon these domestic actors as upon any external endeavor to impose change.

**Legacy actors recalibrate** 

Even as Turkey and Israel now dominate the foreign policy landscape in Syria, the influence of Russia and Iran—once the key players of the Assad regime—has not entirely disappeared from the equation. Yet, Moscow’s simultaneous commitments in Ukraine and selected African theaters have limited its bandwidth for decisive, long-term influence in a future Syrian order.

Iran’s standing, meanwhile, has eroded under persistent Israeli strike campaigns and the partial redeployment of its Shia militia clients. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, among others, have resumed formal relations with the transitional regime in Damascus, aiming to curtail the expanding reaches of Iranian and Turkish influence while re-establishing a degree of Arab authority in the eastern Levant.

Simultaneously, Jordan has adopted a discreet stabilizing posture along the southern frontier, engaging in confidential mediation among Israel, Druze leaders and remnants of the Syrian military. After the Syrian Civil War started (which was also instigated by Erdogan, among other imperialist players), the large majority of Armenians and Christians fled Syria, likely never to return (just like the large majority of Armenians, Christians and Yazidis, who fled post-Saddam Iraq, when it descended into sectarian violence and civil war conditions)."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025."

## Actions
```
web_search("Turkey President US Israel Syria February 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria. One article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:8782>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:8800>. It also mentions a meeting between Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8785>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:8800>.

Another article from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) also mentions the meeting between Erdogan and al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8834>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. An article from mondediplo.com ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The JINSA report from April 23, 2025, states that on March 30, 2025, Erdogan called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated." The report also mentions that on January 15, 2025, Erdogan said Israel must end aggressive actions in Syria. The report also mentions that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over. ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf))

The Al Jazeera article, published on August 29, 2025, reports that Turkey closed its airspace to Israel and severed economic and trade ties due to the war in Gaza. ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) The Haaretz article, published on July 3, 2025, discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations. ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Erdogan made statements against Israel in March 2025. Specifically, on March 30, 2025, he called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

The evidence does mention that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). Also, the Haaretz article discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)).

The claim is not directly supported by the evidence, as it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

### Possible Scenarios

#### Where Is the Turkish-Israeli Rivalry in Syria Headed?

23 أبريل، 2025

! Israel also aims to forge diplomatic relations with Damascus and legitimize the realities it has imposed on the ground by force, through an agreement that would recognize a redrawn border, formalize the demilitarized zones, and acknowledge Israel's special relationship with Syria's Druze community.

Moreover, Israel wants such an agreement to prevent Damascus from hosting Palestinian factions, reduce Turkish influence in Syria, place limitations on Syria's foreign relations, and obstruct any regional coordination that contradicts Israeli interests—such as the regional mechanism that Ankara is working to establish with Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan to counter Israel's destabilizing role in the area.

Pressure Tools

Both Turkey and Israel are strategically deploying their respective advantages against one another within the Syrian arena, utilizing various mechanisms in their ongoing competitive struggle.

1- Turkey’s tools

Ankara possesses unique and exclusive advantages in Syria, controlling several pressure points unavailable to Tel Aviv—advantages the Turkish government actively leverages to counterbalance Israeli attempts at expanding influence throughout Syria. The prospect of a unified and strong Syria runs counter to Israel's regional interests, prompting Tel Aviv to exploit ethnic and sectarian divisions—particularly the Kurdish question—as an effective pressure mechanism against both Ankara and Damascus.

This strategy encountered a significant setback after Syrian President al-Sharaa reached an agreement on March 10 with Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander Mazloum Abdi, effectively undercutting Israel's attempts to manipulate the Kurdish dossier. The Trump administration's policy on Syria remains ambiguous—with some officials echoing the Israeli stance while President Erdogan finds little popularity within the administration, Trump himself possibly being an exception. Trump demonstrated this stance during his meeting with Netanyahu on April 7, asserting his ability to resolve any disagreement with Erdogan over Syria by citing his strong personal relationship with the Turkish leader.

Under the proposed scenario, Turkey would be expected to acknowledge Israel's security concerns and serve as a guarantor that Syria would not be used as a base for any military operations against Israel. Additionally, Israeli recognition that the Shebaa Farms belonged to Syria before occupation would undermine Hezbollah's justification for armed presence and facilitate the recently resumed negotiations on Israeli-Lebanese border demarcation.

Currently, the Israeli army controls 460 square kilometers beyond the disengagement line. <image:8878>

Syria has become a battleground for intensifying competition between Turkey and Israel. During his visit, Halevi reaffirmed existing strategic plans to maintain control over those territories—raising further questions about the future trajectory of the Turkish-Israeli rivalry in Syria. Defense Minister Israel Katz previously stated that Israeli forces would remain in the Syrian buffer zone indefinitely.

Israel is also working to prevent Turkey from expanding its strategic depth and filling the vacuum left by Iran's retreat in Syria. The minority card:

Israel actively leverages minority issues as a strategic tool to weaken Damascus, deliberately ensuring Syria remains too fragmented to challenge Israeli military dominance."

One article from en.majalla.com ([Source](https://en.majalla.com/node/326812/politics/israel-and-t%C3%BCrkiye-must-clarify-their-red-lines-syria)) mentions meetings between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in September 2023 <image:8782>, and between Erdogan and Syria's Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on January 15, 2025 <image:8800>. It also mentions a meeting between Erdogan and Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8785>, and Israeli strikes in Damascus on July 16, 2025 <image:8800>.

Another article from The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-talks-with-turkey-on-syria-aimed-at-preserving-security-stability/)) also mentions the meeting between Erdogan and al-Sharaa on February 4, 2025 <image:8834>, and that the US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. An article from mondediplo.com ([Source](https://mondediplo.com/2025/05/02turkey)) mentions a speech by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on March 30, 2025, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not directly support the claim. While it mentions meetings between Turkish and Syrian officials in January and February 2025, and a speech by Erdogan on March 30, 2025, it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel in March 2025. The evidence also mentions Israeli strikes in Damascus in July 2025, but this is not related to the claim.

The evidence does mention that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered to mediate between Israel and Turkey. However, there is no information about Turkey's President urging the U.S. to control Israel.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm the claim.

([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/29/turkiye-closes-airspace-to-israel-entirely-cutting-ties-over-gaza-war)) The Haaretz article, published on July 3, 2025, discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations. ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000))


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Erdogan made statements against Israel in March 2025. Specifically, on March 30, 2025, he called for Israel to be "destroyed and devastated" ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Erdogan urged the U.S. to control Israel.

The evidence does mention that in late March and early April, Israel conducted airstrikes targeting Syrian airbases Turkey planned to take over ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)). Also, the Haaretz article discusses President Donald Trump's involvement in Syria-Israel relations ([Source](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-03/ty-article/.premium/as-trump-pushes-syria-toward-israel-erdogan-asks-whats-in-it-for-him/00000197-cf3b-d083-a3b7-ff7bda9e0000)).

The claim is not directly supported by the evidence, as it does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results discuss the relationship between Turkey, Israel, and Syria in 2025. The Armenian Weekly article mentions Turkish military intervention in March 2025 <image:k>. The article from futureuae.com mentions an agreement reached on March 10, 2025, between Syrian President al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, which undermined Israel's attempts to manipulate the Kurdish issue, and a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu on April 7, where Trump asserted his ability to resolve any disagreement with Erdogan over Syria <image:8878>. The madamasr.com article does not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim. While the search results confirm that there were events involving Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025, there is no mention of Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel.


## Final Judgement
The search results indicate that there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025. However, the evidence does not support the claim that Turkey's President urged the U.S. to control Israel.

`false`

Israeli airstrike decimates Syrian airbase

Published On 3 Apr 20253 Apr 2025

Syria has accused Israel of attempting to destabilise the country after it was hit by a double whammy of attacks on airbases and a deadly ground incursion, marking an intensification of Israeli military activity in the country.

Syria’s state news agency SANA said that Israeli shelling overnight on Wednesday in Syria’s southern province of Deraa killed nine people, and described a ground incursion by [Israel’s soldiers](/features/2024/12/11/israel-attack-syria-explainer)
 in the area as the deepest since the toppling of former President Bashar al-Assad.

end of list

The country’s Foreign Ministry said on Telegram on Thursday that the overnight raids were an “unjustified escalation”, describing them as “a deliberate attempt to destabilise Syria and exacerbate the suffering of its people”.

A spokesperson for the Israeli army said on Thursday that it was responding to fire from gunmen during the ground operation in the Tasil area, near the city of Nawa, “seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure”.

“\[Israel’s military\] will not allow the existence of a military threat in Syria and will act against it,” the spokesperson added.

Residents of the Tasil area told the Reuters news agency that a group of armed locals were killed after confronting an Israeli army contingent that had arrived in the area to destroy a former Syrian army encampment.

Geir Pedersen, the United Nations envoy for Syria, decried “the repeated and intensifying military escalations by Israel in Syria”, saying that they undermined “efforts to build a new Syria at peace with itself and the region”.

He called on Israel “to cease these attacks which could amount to serious violations of international law”.

Strategic airbase smashed
-------------------------

Israeli aircraft carried out two attacks on military targets near Damascus late on Thursday, war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.

“Israeli warplanes carried out air strikes on military positions and posts” in the vicinity of al-Kiswah and al-Muqaylibah outside Damascus, the Observatory said, adding that there were no immediate reports of casualties.

On Wednesday, Israel launched some of its most intense [air attacks](/news/2025/3/3/israel-launches-air-attacks-near-syrias-tartous)
 on Syria since rebels led by interim President [Ahmed al-Sharaa](/news/2025/3/30/syrian-president-unveils-transitional-government)
 deposed al-Assad in December.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry said Israel struck five separate areas within a 30-minute window overnight on Wednesday, resulting in the near-complete destruction of the Hama airbase and wounding dozens of civilians and soldiers.

The Israeli military said it had struck remaining military capabilities at airbases in Hama and Homs Governorates, in addition to remaining military infrastructure in the Damascus area, where Syrian media and officials said the vicinity of a scientific research facility was hit.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said that the attacks were “a clear message and a warning for the future – we will not allow the security of the State of Israel to be harmed”.

Reflecting Israeli concerns about Turkish influence in the new Syria, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar accused Turkiye of playing a “negative role” in Syria, Lebanon and other regions.

“They are doing their utmost to have Syria as a Turkish protectorate. It’s clear that is their intention,” he told a news conference in Paris on Thursday.

Turkiye’s Foreign Ministry described Israel as a “strategic destabiliser” that was “causing chaos and feeding terrorism”, representing “the greatest threat to regional security”.

“Therefore, in order to establish security throughout the region, Israel must first abandon its expansionist policies, withdraw from the territories it occupies, and stop undermining efforts to establish stability in Syria,” said the ministry.

Neighbouring Jordan called Israel’s repeated attacks on Syria a clear breach of the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two countries and a “flagrant violation of international law”.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar also condemned the Israeli attacks.

Israel has carried out an extensive bombing campaign against Syrian military targets since rebels assumed control of the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded in February that southern Syria be completely demilitarised and said his government would not accept the presence of the forces of the new government near Israeli territory.

In December, Netanyahu ordered troops to enter the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces along the 1974 armistice line on the occupied Golan Heights.

From [Source](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2025/04/syria-briefing.php): 
Content: "Algeria and Somalia requested the meeting after the Permanent Mission of Syria to the UN sent a 7 April letter to the Council (S/2025/216) concerning recent Israeli attacks on Syrian territory. It also called on the Council to “compel” Israel to cease its attacks on Syrian territory, withdraw its forces, and fully comply with the Disengagement of Forces Agreement.

Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, Israel has conducted hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military assets and expanded control over the Golan. Syria’s letter follows the most recent series of Israeli airstrikes, which took place on 2 and 3 April and [reportedly](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce92g5nk55eo)
 hit Syrian airbases and military sites—including the Hama and Tiyas (T4) airbases—as well as military infrastructure in Damascus. Israel also shelled the southern province of Daraa—killing nine civilians, [according](https://sana.sy/en/?p=351154)
 to Syrian state media—and launched a ground incursion into the province. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-says-several-gunmen-eliminated-after-firing-on-troops-in-southern-syria/#:~:text=Tasil%20is%20located%20some%2013,regime%20to%20Islamist%2Dled%20rebels.)
 said that their incursion was a response to fire from gunmen on Israeli troops operating in the southern Syrian town of Tasil overnight while they were “seizing weapons and destroying terrorist infrastructure”.

Meanwhile, the strikes on the T4 airbase in the Homs province followed [reports](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-moves-take-control-syrias-strategic-t4-air-base-sources)
 that Türkiye is planning to establish control of the base and deploy air defence systems there, in line with an agreement currently under discussion between the authorities in Damascus and Ankara that would commit Türkiye to supporting Syrian defence and counterterrorism capabilities. Senior Israeli officials have [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-strikes-hit-syrian-airbases-that-turkey-scoped-out-sources/)
 stated that they are not seeking a conflict with Türkiye but do not want the country to establish itself on Israel’s borders and will seek to prevent it from assuming responsibility for Syrian military bases. Pedersen condemned the “repeated and intensifying military escalations by Israel in Syria, including airstrikes that have reportedly resulted in civilian casualties”. *   [Monthly  \

Syria: Briefing
===============

Tomorrow morning (10 April), the Security Council will hold an open briefing on [**Syria**](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/syria/)
. Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix and Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific Mohamed Khaled Khiari are expected to brief.

The 7 April letter described Israeli attacks on Syrian territory as a “serious threat” to international peace and security and a violation of international law, the UN Charter, relevant UN resolutions, and the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and Syria. (This agreement ended the Yom Kippur War and established in the Golan an area of separation, which is a UN-monitored buffer zone, and an area of limitation, where Israeli and Syrian troops and equipment are restricted.) In the letter, Syria condemned what it called Israeli “aggression” on its territory and accused Israel of aiming to undermine the country’s stability and security, “prolong the suffering of its people”, and establish “a new occupation reality” on Syrian territory."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Iran launched strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain the image of tents on fire. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image in the claim depicts tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes.

I need additional information to confirm the claim. Specifically, I need evidence that directly links the image of the burning tents to the Iranian strikes on Israel.

_________________________



JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-warns-of-consequences-after-iran-launches-181-missiles-in-major-attack/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-warns-of-consequences-after-iran-launches-181-missiles-in-major-attack/)) published an article about Iranian strikes against Israel, including an image of what appears to be missiles in the sky. <image:8910>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched strikes against Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not contain the image of tents on fire. Therefore, I cannot verify if the image in the claim depicts tents engulfed in flames after the Iranian strikes.

I need additional information to confirm the claim. Specifically, I need evidence that directly links the image of the burning tents to the Iranian strikes on Israel.

The new evidence includes images of burning tents. However, the provided articles describe incidents where Israel was responsible for the strikes, not Iran. The image in the claim is similar to the images in the evidence, but there is no direct link between the image in the claim and the Iranian strikes on Israel.

Therefore, I cannot verify the claim.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \[Debbie Hill/AP\]

Published On 9 Jan 20259 Jan 2025

The Polish government has adopted a resolution promising that senior Israeli officials – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – can freely travel to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp later this month.

Netanyahu faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in Israel’s war on Gaza.

“The Polish government treats the safe participation of the leaders of Israel in the commemorations on January 27, 2025, as part of paying tribute to the Jewish nation, millions of whose daughters and sons became victims of the Holocaust carried out by the Third Reich,” read the resolution, published by the office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday.

Tusk told reporters that “whether it is the prime minister, the president or the minister – as it is currently declared – of education of Israel, whoever will come to Oswiecim for the celebrations in Auschwitz will be assured of safety and will not be detained.”

In November, the ICC issued [arrest warrants](/news/2024/11/21/netanyahu-gallant-issued-icc-arrest-warrants-for-war-crimes-whats-next)
 for Netanyahu and his ex-defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas commander Ibrahim a-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Israel has condemned the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, saying that it has acted in self-defence triggered by Hamas’s [7 October 2023 attack](/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)
 on Israel.

As a member state of the ICC, Poland is required to detain suspects facing arrest warrants if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. Israel is not a member of the ICC and disputes its jurisdiction.

Unclear if Netanyahu will attend
--------------------------------

On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Poland’s President Andrzej Duda wrote to Tusk asking that Netanyahu be allowed to attend the commemoration “unhindered”, given the event’s exceptional nature.

Malgorzata Paprocka, the head of Duda’s office, confirmed to state news agency PAP on Thursday that a letter had been sent.

“In the opinion of the president, there is one issue – precisely because it is the Auschwitz camp, every person from Israel, every representative of the authorities of this country should have the opportunity to take part in this exceptional event,” she said.

Prime Minister Tusk, who signed the resolution, said he had received information from the Israeli embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister.

Netanyahu has not said whether he would attend the Auschwitz commemoration. He has attended previous anniversary events at Auschwitz.

Over 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, died in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Nazi Germany set up in occupied Poland during World War II.

WARSAW — Poland’s President Andrzej Duda is asking the country’s government to ensure that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-11-21/benjamin-netanyahu-hamas-international-criminal-court-arrest-warrants)
 can attend observances marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz later this month without the risk of being arrested, a Polish presidential aide said Thursday.

Netanyahu became an internationally wanted suspect after the International Criminal Court, the world’s top war crimes court, issued an arrest warrant for him and others in connection with the 15-month war in Gaza, accusing them of crimes against humanity.

There have been reports suggesting that the warrant could prevent Netanyahu from traveling to Poland to attend observances marking the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp by Soviet forces on Jan.

Member countries of the ICC, including Poland, are required to detain suspects facing a warrant if they set foot on their soil, but the court has no way to enforce that. 18, 2024. The Polish Foreign Ministry, in response to an email query, said Thursday that “it has not received any information so far indicating that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to attend the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.”

“Poland is a safe country and any leader visiting Poland is entitled to protection granted by the Ministry of the Interior,” it added. The ministry also suggested that any idea that Netanyahu could be arrested in Poland is “fake news” that spread in U.S. Historians say that most of them, about a million, were Jewish, but the victims also included Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and others.

Duda has asked the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk to provide Netanyahu with protection from arrest, according to a top Duda aide, Malgorzata Paprocka, according to a report from PAP, the Polish state news agency.

Paprocka said that every Israeli state official and citizen should have the right to take part in the anniversary commemorations, and noted that “all instruments” related to ensuring Netanyahu’s stay in Poland are in the hands of Tusk’s government.

Bloomberg News first reported that Duda sent the request to Tusk by letter.

Paprocka said Duda’s office was still awaiting a reply.

According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Israel's military incursion into the enclave, a response to the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people.

Israel is not a member of the ICC, but Poland is a founding member and legally bound to execute the warrant.

Safe conduct for Israeli PM
---------------------------

Citing "absolutely extraordinary circumstances," Polish President Andrzej Duda on January 9 asked [Donald Tusk](/en/donald-tusk/t-38238452)
 and his government to guarantee safe conduct for Netanyahu should he decide to participate in the event.

In a rare display of unanimity between the government and the president, Tusk's government passed a resolution supporting Duda's request the same day.

However, the resolution did not mention Netanyahu by name, which was understandable given that the Israeli prime minister did not actually plan to attend in person — as [_The Times of Israel_ confirmed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-aide-says-attending-auschwitz-memorial-in-poland-currently-not-in-the-program/ "External link — The Times of Israel confirmed")
 on January 9.

Nevertheless, the decision was met with opposition and protest in [Poland](/en/poland/t-19070837)
.

So, if Netanyahu was not planning to come, why did the Polish government pass the resolution in the first place?

'Tribute to the Jewish people'
------------------------------

The resolution stated that the guarantee of safety for Israeli representatives was "part of paying tribute to the Jewish people, millions of whose daughters and sons were victims of the Holocaust perpetrated by the Third Reich."

Tusk himself said the case was "very delicate."

"On the one hand," he said, "we have the verdict of an international tribunal, but on the other, it is absolutely clear to me that any representative of the Israeli authorities should have every right to and sense of security when visiting the Auschwitz camp, especially on the anniversary \[of its liberation\]."

Critical reactions in Poland
----------------------------

One of the first prominent critics of the government's decision was a respected Polish judge, Piotr Hofmanski, a former ICC president.

Hofmanski underlined Poland's unconditional obligation under international law to execute the warrant. [Skip to more DW sites](#footer)

There are places on Polish soil that hold a deep significance not only for Poles, but also for Jews and many people in Israel. Only 24.2% favored guaranteeing Netanyahu safe conduct, and 16.6% were undecided.

Pro-Palestinian activists organized a protest in Warsaw, during which several hundred people chanted "Arrest Netanyahu!" and "The Polish government's got blood on its hands."

A group of NGOs, including the initiative East, a Gen-Z organization fighting for social justice and against climate change, Action for Democracy and All-Poland Women's Strike also wrote an open letter asking Tusk to withdraw the resolution.

The Polish Supreme Bar Council appealed to the president and the government to adhere unconditionally to the rule of law and implement it in word and deed.

In an open letter, the council stressed that the rulings of courts and international tribunals must not be viewed as a matter of choice and that the non-execution of the ICC warrant would undermine "the trust of the citizens in the rule of law in Poland" and is dangerous — even if the external security of the country dictates it.

What's the role of the US?
--------------------------

The reference to Poland's external security could have been a response to media reports about another alleged motivation behind the resolution.

The arrest of the head of the Israeli government at the most notorious and symbolic site of the Holocaust would undoubtedly spark an international outcry and trigger a fierce response from the recently inaugurated Trump administration, a strong ally of both Poland and Israel.

Polish media quoted anonymous sources close to the government who claimed that the resolution was mainly aimed at averting the very real risk of a crisis in [US](/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189)
\-Polish relations right at the start of the second [Trump](/en/donald-trump/t-19434433)
 administration.

Moreover, on January 9, the US House of Representatives passed a bill threatening to impose sanctions against anyone who helps the ICC prosecute US citizens or US allies, which includes Israel.

Did the president set a trap for Tusk?
--------------------------------------

Whether it was his intention or not, President Duda, due to leave office at the end of his second term in August, created a difficult situation for the government four months ahead of country's presidential election.

This election could determine whether Prime Minister Tusk will have an ally in the presidential palace and, therefore, a potentially easier path to implementing his campaign promises or face the prospect of working with a second president linked to the [opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party](/en/law-and-justice-pis/t-66789976)
.

The resolution passed by Tusk and his government might not only cost his ally and preferred presidential candidate, Rafal Trzaskowski, votes, but may have dented Poland's credibility on the global stage — with the notable exception of its relations with the Trump White House.

The resolution pledging not to arrest Netanyahu was also met with widespread opposition across the Polish political spectrum. Journalists, experts, bloggers, political commentators, judicial authorities and the opposition — from the far left to the far right — condemned the decision, albeit for different reasons.

The resolution caused uproar among left-wing activists and politicians, as well as supporters of the Palestinian cause.

"Not in my name," posted Adrian Zandberg, leader of the Polish left-wing Razem (Together) party, on X (formerly Twitter).

This attitude was also reflected in opinion polls.

The Iranian attack marked the latest escalation in fighting that now stretches into several countries in the region, with warnings that more fighting is likely. They include the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, [Hassan Nasrallah](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25302/who-was-hassan-nasrallah-the-hezbollah-leader-killed-by-israel)

Iran has launched an unprecedented attack against Israel, firing a barrage of missiles at the country in [the latest escalation](/news/liveblog/2024/10/1/israels-war-on-gaza-israel-says-it-will-respond-to-iran-missile-attacks)
 amid weeks of soaring violence and tensions in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said on Tuesday that it [fired missiles](/news/2024/10/1/israel-says-iran-launches-missile-attack-warns-residents-to-shelter)
 at Israel in response to deadly Israeli attacks against people in Gaza and Lebanon, as well as the assassinations of top IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.

Alarms sounded in Israel on Tuesday evening as the missiles fell on major cities and towns.

Israel and its top ally, [the United States](/news/2024/10/1/us-says-helped-israel-thwart-iranian-attack-reasserts-ironclad-support)
, said their respective militaries worked together to shoot down most of the nearly 200 projectiles that were fired by Iran.

The Israeli army said only a “few” hits were recorded in central and southern parts of the country while two people were injured from falling shrapnel in the Tel Aviv area, according to Israel’s emergency service.

Here’s what we know about the attack, the wider context, and what could come next.

What happened?
--------------

*   The exact details of the Iranian operation remain unclear, but the IRGC said in a statement that the missiles were aimed at “vital military and security targets” in Israel.
*   The IRGC said later that its attack was aimed specifically at three military bases in the Tel Aviv area.
*   The attack, which was accompanied by a large-scale cyberattack, also employed Iran’s new Fatah hypersonic ballistic missiles for the first time, according to Iranian state media.
*   The Israeli military said it intercepted “a large number” of the 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran, but that there were “isolated” impacts in central and southern Israel. We absolutely need a ceasefire.”

What comes next?
----------------

*   Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel is “fully prepared to defend and retaliate” against the Iranian attack, stressing that it would be in a “timely manner”.
*   Sullivan, the White House adviser, told reporters that the Biden administration “made clear that there will be consequences — severe consequences — for this attack” by Iran, and the US “will work with Israel to make that the case”.
*   Iran has warned Israel against responding to its attack, threatening to launch further missiles at the country if it retaliates.
*   Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at the US-based think tank DAWN, told Al Jazeera that the Middle East was now in “a full-scale regional war” that will not end without a change in American policy. The IRGC said that 90 percent of the projectiles fired hit their targets.
*   US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the American military “coordinated closely” with its Israeli counterparts to shoot down the projectiles.
*   “US naval destroyers joined Israeli air defence units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.
*   Sullivan said no deaths were reported in Israel: “In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,” he said.

What was the attack in response to?
-----------------------------------

*   The IRGC said Tuesday’s attack was in response to the assassination of [Hassan Nasrallah](/news/2024/9/28/israels-military-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah)
    , the head of Lebanese group Hezbollah, and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan last week in Beirut, as well as the killing of Hamas leader [Ismail Haniyeh](/news/2024/7/31/life-of-defiance-ismail-haniyeh-hamas-political-boss-killed)
     in Tehran in July.
*   Experts have warned over the past year that the Middle East was on the brink of regional war amid Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians since October 2023.
*   Lebanese group Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel shortly after the Gaza war began, saying it aimed to support Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
*   The Israeli military has been exchanging fire with Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border since that time, displacing tens of thousands of people in both countries.
*   Over the past month, the Israeli military escalated its attacks on Lebanon, striking targets in the capital Beirut and fuelling more [fears of an all-out war](/news/2024/9/24/disastrous-failure-how-biden-emboldened-israel-to-attack-lebanon)

How have world leaders reacted to the Iranian attack?
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran had “made a big mistake” and “will pay for it”.
*   Israel’s envoy to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said the country “will take all necessary measures to protect the citizens of Israel”: “As we have previously made clear to the international community, any enemy that attacks Israel should expect a severe response,” Danon wrote on social media.
*   Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on X that the attack was a “decisive response” to Israel’s “aggressions”. “Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.”
*   Mohammad Javad Zarif, the strategic adviser to Pezeshkian, said “Iran has an inherent right of self-defence against repeated Israeli armed attacks against Iranian territory and its citizens.”
*   Hamas, the Palestinian group that governs Gaza, welcomed the Iranian attack as “heroic” and said it sent “a strong message to the Zionist enemy and its fascist government that will help deter and rein in their terrorism”.
*   The US pledged its “ironclad” support for Israel, with President Joe Biden saying that his country was “fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel”. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Washington would “stand by the people of Israel at this critical moment”.
*   The Pentagon [also said](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3922464/readout-of-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-j-austin-iiis-call-with-israeli-minister/)
     US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant had discussed “the severe consequences for Iran” should it launch a “direct military attack” on Israel. 
> Western States have aided and abetted the Israeli genocide in Gaza and acquiesced in Israeli aggressions against Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and other countries in the region. “You’re going to get into the type of retaliatory action, back and forth, that spawns a greater war,” he told Al Jazeera.
*   Rahman added that Israel “has been trying to invite this war” through [its actions](/news/2024/9/20/israel-hits-beirut-lebanon-air-strike-hezbollah-fires-rockets)
     over the past several months. Iran, I think, has tried to avoid that, but it’s on the path to some type of war with Israel.”

Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets at an Israeli military base in the northern region of the country on Sunday, as Israel and the militant group continue to exchange fire amid escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The militant group said the attack, which targeted the Ramat David airbase, near the northern city of Haifa, was “in response to the [repeated Israeli attacks](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs," the Associated Press [reported](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-rocket-attack-mideast-tensions-0584727974096d98d1b5b132dfd1d218)
.

"We have entered a new phase, the title of which is the [open-ended battle of reckoning](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-israel-exchange-heavy-fire-after-deadly-israeli-strike-2024-09-22/)
," Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Qassem said on Sunday.

Israel Defense Forces [confirmed](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837680273405702296)
 on social media that "large areas of northern Israel are being targeted by Hezbollah’s rockets." It was unclear whether there were any casualties.

The attack came after a massive Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut [killed](https://www.politico.eu/article/senior-hezbollah-commander-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-beirut/)
 at least 37 people on Friday, including a top Hezbollah military commander.

These missile and rockets exchanges are just [the latest escalations](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/20/israel-hezbollah-escalation-00180299)
 in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah militants, which are fanning fears of a wider war in the region. Israel earlier [said](https://x.com/IDF/status/1837501170182483984)
 it launched a series of airstrikes targeting Hezbollah missile launchers in southern Lebanon.

"In recent days, we have inflicted a [series of blows](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-examining-siege-plan-hamas-north-gaza-israeli-media-report-2024-09-22/)

 on Sunday. "If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will [understand the message](https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hezbollah-will-get-the-message-after-strikes-it-never-imagined/)

, prompting the UN to war of an “imminent catastrophe” if the tit-for-tat violence continues.

Sirens were activated across northern Israel in the early hours of Sunday.

If confirmed, the assault would be Hezbollah’s farthest-reaching attack inside Israel since the start of the ongoing cross-border clashes in October last year.

The Israeli military said more than 100 projectiles were fired early on Sunday from Lebanon, forcing hundreds of thousands to take cover and prompting school closures in Israel’s north.

Educational activities would not be permitted across northern Israel until at least Monday at 6pm (15:00 GMT), the military’s Home Front Command said, affecting “hundreds of thousands of children”, according to military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani.

“In Haifa, a lot of schools are closed … and offices are empty,” said resident Patrice Wolff, who works in the medical industry.

The Israeli military also issued restrictions on large gatherings in northern Israel, including Haifa – the country’s third-largest city.

There were no reports of casualties or any significant damage by rockets in Israel on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Israeli army said it carried out hundreds of air raids across southern Lebanon. It also claimed attacks on 110 other locations in the early hours of Sunday morning.

In a statement issued by his office on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel “inflicted a series of blows” against Hezbollah.

“If Hezbollah has not understood the message, I promise you, it will understand the message.”

Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed that Israeli operations against Hezbollah will continue until residents of northern Israel can return home safely.

‘Imminent catastrophe’
----------------------

The latest violence could lead to an “imminent catastrophe” in the Middle East, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, warned on Sunday, saying a military solution was not the answer.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” she said in a post on X.

Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem also highlighted the significance of the Lebanese group’s attack.

“This is the first time since the 2006 war \[between Israel and Hezbollah\] that Hezbollah’s missiles crossed” 20km (12 miles), Hashem said.

“This is the first time that they’re hitting targets towards 45km \[30 miles\], 50km \[31 miles\], because we’re hearing reports of impacts or interceptions in several areas, including above the Ramat David Airbase to the east of Haifa.”

Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, also reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s message is that despite the blows that they have received in the past few days, “it’s still able to fight and launch rockets and missiles across the border”.

In its statement, Hezbollah said it carried out the attack with so-called Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 rockets, not the World War II era, Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that it has been using over the past several months.

The latest barrage of rocket fire comes after a week of Israeli attacks across Lebanon.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, wireless [communication devices](/news/2024/9/18/chk_exploding-pagers-psychological-warfare-israels-attack-on-hezbollah)
 associated with Hezbollah exploded across Lebanon, injuring thousands and killing dozens, including civilians. Hezbollah has said it is not seeking an all-out war, but it is ready for one should it occur.

Israeli leaders have promised to push Hezbollah off Israel’s border and return its citizens to communities in the north, including through war if necessary.

Death toll in Beirut strike rises
---------------------------------

Israel also conducted an air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Friday that [killed at least 45 people](/news/2024/9/21/death-toll-from-israeli-strike-on-beirut-suburb-rises-to-31)
 and injured dozens more.

Senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was among those killed in the attack that levelled an entire residential building.

Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in daily clashes since the outbreak of the Israeli war on Gaza.

The Lebanese group says it will continue its attacks on Israeli bases in the north of the country until Israel ends its Gaza offensive.

The violence has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.

Content: "Rambam hospital in Haifa would transfer patients to its underground, secure facility, the ministry said.

Israel’s civil defence agency ordered all schools in the north of the country to close.

The successive barrages of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah at the Israeli air force’s Ramat David airbase, located 31 miles (50km) from the Lebanon border, were the deepest strikes it has claimed since hostilities began.

The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, delivered a speech at the airbase on Wednesday, telling air force personnel that Israel’s war with Hezbollah had reached a “new phase”.

In July, Hezbollah released footage filmed by a drone over Haifa that highlighted Ramat David as part of an almost 10-minute long video marking military infrastructure in the densely populated city in northern Israel.

, a veteran commander of the elite Radwan unit, along with more than a dozen other militants.

Three children and seven women were among 37 people killed by the Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday that targeted the top [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 leader, Lebanese authorities have said.

The assassination followed a wave of attacks earlier in the week in which walkie-talkies and pagers commonly used by Hezbollah members exploded, killing 42 people and wounding more than 3,000. <image:8927>

Israeli military says its jets targeted hundreds of Hezbollah sites, while Hezbollah says it launched dozens of missiles at an airbase in northern Israel

The Israeli military says it has launched airstrikes on hundreds of targets in southern Lebanon, as [Hezbollah](https://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah)
 launched its deepest rocket attacks into Israel since the start of the Gaza war, prompting a UN official to warn of “imminent catastrophe” in the region.

Fighting reached its most intense yet overnight, with Israel launching a wave of attacks that it said targeted Hezbollah missile launchers across Lebanon’s south. “Anyone who uses that term either conveniently forgot history or doesn’t understand the current environment, and anyone who thinks ‘escalation’ and ‘limited’ are controllable constructs is delusional.”

On Sunday an Iraqi coalition of pro-Iran armed groups also claimed a drone attack on Israel.

“The fighters of the Islamic Resistance of Iraq targeted on Sunday morning a strategic location in the occupied territories using drones,” said the Iraqi coalition in a statement on Telegram, referring to Israel, adding it was carried out “in support of our people in Gaza”.

The IDF confirmed the attack and said it had intercepted “multiple suspicious aerial targets” coming from Iraq overnight.

----------- Israel’s military said the target was a Hamas base inside the school, without providing details or evidence.

However, the most recent attacks suggest a potential strategic pivot by the Israeli military away from its focus on Hamas in Gaza and towards targeting Hezbollah.

On 8 October, following the Hamas attacks on Israel, Hezbollah entered the conflict in support of the Palestinian militants, with an attack on northern Israel.

Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have managed to avoid an all-out war, engaging instead in a limited conflict of attrition. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck hundreds of Hezbollah targets. At least one person was killed and another injured in the strikes, the Lebanese ministry of health said.

Hezbollah responded with four rocket barrages early on Sunday morning and more than 140 rockets and drones fired into Israel’s Jezreel Valley.

Fresh clashes erupted early on Sunday, with the IDF saying hundreds of rockets had been fired into Israel from Lebanon, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa.

The Israeli military said rockets had been fired “toward civilian areas”, pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets. Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said it had treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was slightly wounded near Haifa.

In a statement, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon warned the region risked disaster.

“With the region on the brink of an imminent catastrophe, it cannot be overstated enough: there is NO military solution that will make either side safer,” special coordinator Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said on X.

As she wrote, the Israeli health ministry urged hospitals in northern Israel to transfer their operations to facilities with extra protection from rocket and missile fire. Israel is presumed to be behind the operation, though it has not officially claimed responsibility.

On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “In the last few days, we have inflicted on Hezbollah a sequence of blows that it did not imagine. If Hezbollah did not understand the message, I promise you - it will understand the message.”

He added: “No country can tolerate shooting at its residents, shooting at its cities - and we, the state of Israel, will not tolerate it either… We will do everything necessary to restore security.”

Israel has not visibly slowed its war in Gaza to focus on the north. On Saturday, its forces bombed a school-turned-shelter, killing at least 22 and injuring 30 others, mostly women and children, the Gaza health ministry said."

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

### Evidence from `web_search`
Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on the Ramat David airbase in northern Israel on September 22, 2024, according to reports from Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/21/hezbollah-claims-rocket-attack-deep-inside-northern-israel)) and The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah-deepest-rocket-attacks-since-start-gaza-war](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/israel-strikes-lebanon-hezbollah-deepest-rocket-attacks-since-start-gaza-war)). Politico.eu also reported on the attack, mentioning it occurred on Sunday, September 22, 2024 ([https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/](https://www.politico.eu/article/hezbollah-launches-revenge-rocket-attack-against-israeli-base/)).

The attacks were in response to Israeli actions, and the strikes were the deepest claimed by Hezbollah since the start of the Gaza war. Al Jazeera included images of the aftermath of the attack (<image:1>, <image:2>), and The Guardian included a dashcam video of the attack (<image:8927>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. However, the provided evidence does not include the image in the claim. Therefore, the authenticity of the image cannot be verified.

The Times of Israel published drone footage of Ramat David airbase, but it does not match the image in the claim. Al Jazeera and The Guardian included images and a dashcam video of the attack, but none of them match the image in the claim either.

To verify the claim, an image of the attack aftermath is needed.

, rock group [U2](/wiki/U2 "U2")
 performed" [Where the Streets Have No Name](/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name "Where the Streets Have No Name")
", while the names of the victims were projected onto banners. The memorial is dedicated to the five individuals at the Pentagon whose remains were never found, and the partial remains of another 25 victims are buried beneath the memorial.[\[95\]](#cite_note-Cass-95)
 The names of the 184 victims of the Pentagon attack are inscribed on the memorial's side.

On September 11, 2002, the documentary play _[Bystander 9/11](/wiki/Bystander_9/11 "Bystander 9/11")

10th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 10th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

20th anniversary memorial services
----------------------------------

\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Memorials_and_services_for_the_September_11_attacks&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 20th anniversary memorial services")\
\]

The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened [withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan](/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020%E2%80%932021) "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)")
 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Content: "(AP Photo)

A spokesperson for Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s office confirmed to media outlets on Monday for the first time that Israel was behind a string of devastating attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.

During a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu reportedly boasted that Israel was behind the attacks, but while the Jewish state was widely believed to have been responsible, there had been no official confirmation from the government or military until spokesman Omer Dostri’s statement on Monday.

[On September 17, thousands of pagers simultaneously exploded](https://www.timesofisrael.com/several-killed-thousands-hurt-as-wave-of-pager-explosions-strikes-hezbollah/)
 in the southern suburbs of Beirut and other Hezbollah strongholds across Lebanon.

The coordinated attack dealt a deadly blow to the Iran-backed Lebanese terror group, and kicked off an escalation that continued with the assassination of almost all of Hezbollah’s leadership, including Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, and a limited Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said the incident was the “biggest security breach” for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel.

Netanyahu reportedly claimed to cabinet ministers on Sunday that senior defense officials and political figures were opposed to the detonation of the pagers but that he went ahead with the operation.

“The pager operation and the elimination of \[Hezbollah leader Hassan\] Nasrallah were carried out despite the opposition of senior officials in the defense establishment and those responsible for them in the political echelon,” he reportedly said, in a clear dig at recently fired defense minister Yoav Gallant.

Netanyahu and Gallant have clashed repeatedly over the course of their time in government together. <image:2317>

A Hezbollah official told Reuters a week later that the attacks put 1,500 of the group’s fighters out of commission due to their injuries, with many having been blinded or had their hands blown off.

In the aftermath, various media outlets reported that the attack was a [highly sophisticated Israeli intelligence operation years in the making](https://www.timesofisrael.com/how-hezbollah-was-fooled-into-purchasing-explosive-pagers/)
 in which Hezbollah was fooled into purchasing the compromised devices.

Josh Einiger has details on the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.

LONDON -- Israel's cabinet has approved the U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal between Israel and Hezbollah after prolonged negotiations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had submitted the proposal to the cabinet for approval Tuesday evening local time. local time, Biden said.

"Israel appreciates the US contribution to the process, and reserves its right to act against any threat to its security," the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said, translated from Hebrew.

Netanyahu said earlier, when submitting the deal for approval, that the deal still relies on the actions of Hezbollah.

"The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon," Netanyahu said in a statement. We will continue together until victory."

The prime minister hailed "great achievements" on all fronts of the war, including killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and destroying their weapons across the country.

"With full understanding with the United States, we maintain complete military freedom of action," Netanyahu said in the address, translated from Hebrew. If it launches a rocket, if it digs a tunnel, if it brings in a truck with missiles -- we will attack."

Netanyahu attended a meeting with security officials on Sunday night regarding a ceasefire with Israel's Hezbollah adversaries in Lebanon, an Israeli official told ABC News.

This was part of ongoing talks, including Netanyahu's meeting last week in Israel with U.S. Hochstein also traveled to Beirut to discuss a potential way forward.

Netanyahu then held a security cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the deal and hold a cabinet vote, Israeli officials said.

In October, Israel invaded southern Lebanon in an escalation of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group.

Tensions heightened last weekend as the countries' leaders worked to negotiate a ceasefire deal. "If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself -- we will attack. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in one of the group's heaviest retaliations in months.

Truth behind Hezbollah drone photo of Netanyahu revealed
========================================================

Published :  

09-08-2024 10:14|

[MENA](/section/2)

An image surfaced, purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone, shows "Israeli" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu inside his office.

The image in question shows Netanyahu seated in what appears to be his office, with the photo seemingly taken through a window from outside the building. 

The accompanying social media caption asserts that "Hezbollah captured this image of the Israeli Prime Minister.”.

However, an investigation by Agence France-Presse (AFP) revealed that the image is not as it seems. 

Search engines and image verification tools have determined that the photo is a composite, created from an older original image published in 2009.

The authentic photo shows Netanyahu with his father at their residence in Jerusalem on February 8, 2009, according to Getty Images. 

The circulating image has been manipulated to give the false impression that it was taken from outside an office building.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is partially supported by the evidence. Royanews.tv reported on an image purportedly captured by a Hezbollah reconnaissance drone showing Benjamin Netanyahu in his office, but AFP revealed that the image was a composite ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/hezbollah-takes-responsibility-for-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-holiday-home)). The evidence also indicates that Hezbollah carried out rocket attacks on Israel ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/22/hezbollah-takes-responsibility-for-drone-attack-on-netanyahu-holiday-home)).

The evidence confirms that Hezbollah was involved in actions related to Benjamin Netanyahu, including a drone attack on his holiday residence. However, the image in question was a composite, not a genuine capture by Hezbollah.

Therefore, the claim is **partially accurate**.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7800>). The Times of Israel published an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders (<image:7801>). Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7802>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence includes multiple images of Esmail Qaani, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is Esmail Qaani and the context of the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

Afghan Officials: Iran’s New Quds Chief Likely Faked Identity in 2018

Print

Afghan officials say they are investigating a visit in 2018 of the new commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, Esmail Qaani, to the province of Bamiyan where he claimed to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul.

Qaani, a 61-year-old brigadier general, became the chief of the Quds Force, the foreign wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), following the U.S. At this point I can assure you that he was never the deputy ambassador in Afghanistan,” Idrees Zaman, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, said in a press conference Tuesday.

Some Afghanistan analysts like Jonathan Schroden, the director of Center for Stability and Development at Washington-based research and analysis organization CNA, are charging that Iran might have arranged for the alleged disguise to prevent the Afghan government’s monitoring.

“It is hard to say whether he was actually traveling under a false title in this case; it’s possible that Iran could have named him as a DCM, if even temporarily, in whatever travel documents he had, etc., in order to provide him official cover for his travel,” Schroden said.

He however expressed some skepticism over the alleged disguise, saying it is unlikely that Iran’s commander could hide behind a bogus identity given his high-profile status for years in Iran and the wider region.

**Recruitment**

Other experts say Qaani’s visit could be seen as an effort to mobilize Shiite people to support the Quds Force, given Iran’s previous efforts to gain influence among Shiites in Afghanistan.

Regional experts say it was Qaani’s duty to actively recruit for the Quds Force among Shia populations in Afghanistan.

Farzin Nadimi, an associate fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told VOA that one of Iran’s main targets has been to establish a foothold in the Shiite areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He added that it is generally believed that “his \[Soleimani\] deputy, Gen. Esmail Qaani was in charge of QF operations in Central Asia while \[Soleimani\] himself was busy fighting the Americans, Israel and IS in Iraq, Lebanon and Levant.”

According to Michael Kugelman, the deputy director of the Asia Program at the Wilson Center, Iran since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 has recruited thousands of Afghans into what is known as the Fatemiyoun battalion. killing of Qassem Soleimani Friday in an airstrike.

Shortly after his appointment, Afghan media circulated pictures showing him paying an official visit to Bamiyan province in July 2018, allegedly as Iran’s deputy ambassador.

The governor of Bamiyan, Mohammad Tahir Zuhair, who appeared in one of the photos giving Qaani a local tapestry, told VOA that Qaani introduced himself as an Iranian diplomat visiting the province to reiterate Iran’s support for the local government.

“Let me emphasize again that no foreign delegation ever comes to this province without Kabul coordinating the visit. We were told by Kabul that an Iranian delegation would oversee the process of building a hospital in Bamiyan,” Zuhair told VOA.

The governor said officials in Kabul instructed the local government to provide Qaani and his team with security and logistics assistance.

“The Iranian delegation spent about 45 minutes in the hospital and then came to my office and we met. He said that they came to Bamiyan to tell the people that Iran liked to help them,” he told VOA.

At the time of his visit to Bamiyan, Qaani was serving as the deputy commander of the Quds Force under Soleimani.

**Why the visit?**

Afghan officials say that Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan, raising questions about the intentions of his visit to the predominately Shiite province in central Afghanistan.

“We are investigating the exact nature and date of his visit."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani hijab")
geolocate(<image:57>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7800>). The Times of Israel published an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders (<image:7801>). Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7802>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence includes multiple images of Esmail Qaani, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is Esmail Qaani and the context of the image.

“Breaking: Iran’s

IRGC Quds Force commander Gen. Esmail Qaani is confirmed safe in Israel

It can now be revealed that he was an Israeli asset, providing intelligence that led to elimination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, and Hezbollah leaders Nasrallah and Safieddine,” reads one user’s post.

This claim is false. **[(RELATED: No, Harvard Study Did Not Confirm Fluoride Lowers Children’s IQ)](https://checkyourfact.com/2024/10/22/fact-check-no-harvard-study-did-not-confirm-fluoride-lowers-childrens-iq/)

Misbar also [debunked](https://www.misbar.com/en/factcheck/2025/04/03/iranian-general-esmail-qaani-did-not-flee-israel)
 this claim. No media outlets have reported that Qaani has defected to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces nor any Israeli government entity has confirmed that Qaani provided intelligence. The outlet reported that while Qaani was under investigation in connection to Nasrallah’s death, he was seen at “rallies commemorating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution” in February 2025.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides additional context. VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani has used a fake identity in the past. AOL fact-checked a claim about Qaani being in Israel and debunked it.

The claim states that the image is of Esmail Qaani disguised in a hijab. While the evidence shows that Qaani has used a fake identity before, it does not confirm that the person in the image is Qaani. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, which is consistent with the claim's implication of fear of Israeli bombing.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is unproven. More evidence is needed to confirm the identity of the person in the image.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani visited Bamiyan province in Afghanistan in 2018, claiming to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul. The article includes a photo of Qaani in Bamiyan. ([https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html))

AOL fact-checked a claim that Esmail Qaani was seen in Israel and was an Israeli asset, and debunked it. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-iranian-general-023005797.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-iranian-general-023005797.html))


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context. VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani has used a fake identity in the past. AOL fact-checked a claim about Qaani being in Israel and debunked it.

The claim states that the image is of Esmail Qaani disguised in a hijab. While the evidence shows that Qaani has used a fake identity before, it does not confirm that the person in the image is Qaani. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, which is consistent with the claim's implication of fear of Israeli bombing.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is unproven. More evidence is needed to confirm the identity of the person in the image.

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani hijab")
geolocate(<image:57>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7800>). The Times of Israel published an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders (<image:7801>). Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7802>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence includes multiple images of Esmail Qaani, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is Esmail Qaani and the context of the image.

Content: "3, but an advisor to IRGC commander-in-chief asserted on Wednesday that Qaani was "in perfect health" and would receive a military medal of honour from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei "in the next few days."

The swirl of conflicting information has sparked attempts at analysis and, inevitably, morbid jokes.

"Rescuing the hostages and citizens of any country is the duty of the government of that country, and now it is the moral duty of Israel to go and rescue Qaani," [quipped](https://x.com/bitternism/status/1844377533065855426)
 an Iranian X user.

Another depicted Qaani gazing up reverently at Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and saluting him in Hebrew: "Shalom."

More sober, Iranian journalist Behrang Rahbari [opined](https://x.com/BehrangRahbari/status/1844382978266497242)
, "Whether Qaani is a spy or not, one thing is certain: the collapse of the security structure of the Islamic Republic and this means the collapse of the system."

Deploying image editing prowess, one user depicted Qaani in a full Israeli military uniform complete with Jewish religious kippah cap and chided, "I mean, from Soleimani to Haniyeh and Nasrallah, all that was your work?! Reports of his death may have been greatly exaggerated.

Days after media outlets suggested a top Iranian commander was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut, new reports citing regional sources said on Thursday that Esmail Qaani is alive but being detained by authorities for potential espionage.

The whipsawing accounts left Iran-watchers bewildered about the [strange fate](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202410076136)
 of the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force and whether the living embodiment of Iran's might abroad might be an Israeli turncoat.

Independent news outlet Middle East Eye reported on Monday that Qaani had been detained and was being questioned as the Islamic Republic seeks to understand how Israel was able to infiltrate its Lebanese ally Hezbollah and assassinate top leaders.

Sky News Arabia, citing Iranian sources, went further, saying Qaani suffered a heart attack while being questioned and that Iranian investigations centered around his chief of staff, named as Ehsan Shafiqi, and his possible communications with Israel.

Qaani has not been seen in public since an huge Israeli air strike on Beirut killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah on Sept. :)"

Similarly, Iranian activist Amin Pouria portrayed Qaani alongside Israeli and American honchos in uniform, Hebraizing his name to Ishmael Kahani.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is unproven. More evidence is needed to confirm the identity of the person in the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post published an article about Esmail Qaani, including a photo of him. ([https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988)) The Wikipedia article on Esmail Qaani describes him as an Iranian brigadier general and commander of the IRGC Quds Force. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani)) Iran International discusses conflicting reports about Qaani's health and whereabouts, including satirical images.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence provides additional images of Esmail Qaani and confirms his role as a brigadier general and commander of the IRGC Quds Force. The Iran International article mentions satirical images related to Qaani, which suggests that the image in the claim could be satirical. However, the evidence does not confirm the identity of the person in the image or the context of the image.

Based on the available evidence, the claim remains unproven. The image could be satirical, but there is no definitive proof.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing."

## Actions
```
image_search("Esmail Qaani hijab")
geolocate(<image:57>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Al-Monitor published an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7800>). The Times of Israel published an image of a woman holding a picture of Iranian leaders (<image:7801>). Fox News provides an image of Esmail Qaani (<image:7802>).


### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.47, 'Jordan': 0.17, 'Israel': 0.09, 'Russia': 0.05, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.03, 'Canada': 0.02, 'Germany': 0.02, 'China': 0.01, 'France': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The evidence includes multiple images of Esmail Qaani, but none of them match the image in the claim. The image search results do not provide any information about the context of the image in the claim. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine.

Based on the available evidence, it is impossible to verify the claim. More information is needed to confirm whether the person in the image is Esmail Qaani and the context of the image.


## Actions
```
web_search("Esmail Qaani disguise")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani visited Bamiyan province in Afghanistan in 2018, claiming to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul. The article includes a photo of Qaani in Bamiyan. ([https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html))

AOL fact-checked a claim that Esmail Qaani was seen in Israel and was an Israeli asset, and debunked it. ([https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-iranian-general-023005797.html](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-iranian-general-023005797.html))


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional context. VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani has used a fake identity in the past. AOL fact-checked a claim about Qaani being in Israel and debunked it.

The claim states that the image is of Esmail Qaani disguised in a hijab. While the evidence shows that Qaani has used a fake identity before, it does not confirm that the person in the image is Qaani. The geolocation data suggests the image was most likely taken in Palestine, which is consistent with the claim's implication of fear of Israeli bombing.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests the image is likely from Turkey, not Gaza. The `geolocate` function indicates a high probability that the image was taken in Turkey. Furthermore, image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically linking the image to the Turkey earthquake. The claim also mentions the date as July 2024, but the evidence suggests the image is related to the Turkey earthquake in February 2023.

The evidence contradicts the claim that the image shows a man from Gaza. The image is more likely related to the Turkey earthquake. The claim also mentions the date as July 2024, but the evidence suggests the image is related to the Turkey earthquake in February 2023.

Based on the evidence, the claim is false.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.

United States vetoes Gaza ceasefire resolution at Security Council
==================================================================

20 November 2024 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The United States on Wednesday vetoed a UN Security Council draft resolution that demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.

Despite having secured 14 votes in favour, the draft resolution put forward by the 10 elected members of the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 (E10), failed to pass owing to the negative vote by a permanent member, the US.

The text also reiterated the Council’s demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

For a resolution to be adopted, it must secure at least nine votes in favour, and no negative votes – or vetoes – by any of the five permanent members.

Under the [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations/index.html)
, the Security Council has the primary responsibility to uphold international peace and security.

The US representative Ambassador Robert Wood said in his statement that the US could not support an unconditional ceasefire unless it was tied to releasing the hostages being held in Gaza by Hamas and other militants. 

Had the draft resolution been adopted, it would have demanded immediate access for civilians in the Gaza Strip to basic services.

It would have rejected “any effort to starve Palestinians” – the threat of famine grows in the north as the Israeli siege there continues – while also demanding the facilitation of full, rapid, safe and unhindered entry of aid at scale to and throughout the Strip and its delivery to all those in need.

The text also demanded that the parties “fully, unconditionally, and without delay” implement all the provisions of Security Council resolution 2735 (2024).

This includes the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the return of the remains of hostages who have been killed, the return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighbourhoods in all areas of Gaza – including in the north – and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

The draft further underscored the role of the UN relief agency for Palestine refugees ([UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
) as the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza.

It called on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate as adopted by the General Assembly, with full respect for the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence.

It also urged respect for international humanitarian law, including the protection of UN and humanitarian facilities, while welcoming the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to fully implement the recommendations of an independent review of the agency led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna.

#### Subscribe to receive SCR publications The frustrations of these members are apparently deepened by the possibility of the US still using its veto tomorrow.

It seems that during the 16 October [closed consultations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/10/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-briefing-and-consultations-on-the-situation-in-northern-gaza.php)
 on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, Algeria asked Guyana, as the E10 coordinator for the month of October, to start consultations on a new Security Council product on the war in Gaza. (For background on the situation in Gaza, see the [brief](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/monthly-forecast/2024-11/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-18.php)
 on “The Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” in our November 2024 _Monthly Forecast_ and our 11 November _What’s in Blue_ [story](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/11/briefing-on-risk-of-famine-in-northern-gaza.php)
.)

_Negotiations on the Draft Resolution_

Negotiations on the draft resolution were difficult, with several Council members apparently disappointed with the low level of ambition of the draft text in blue following various compromises made in an attempt to secure an abstention from the US, Israel’s key ally at the Security Council. Similarly to the press statement, the draft text in blue does not include language “rejecting” actions undermining UNRWA’s mandate, but underscores that UNRWA “remains the backbone” of the humanitarian response in Gaza, calls on all parties to enable UNRWA to carry out its mandate, and welcomes the Secretary-General’s and UNRWA’s commitment to implement the recommendations of an independent review which evaluated UNRWA’s adherence to neutrality principles.

At the same time, a request from the US for language establishing a standing mechanism to review allegations raised by Israel regarding UNRWA employees being affiliated with Hamas was not included in the draft resolution. This position is close to the long-held US stance that the two calls should be linked in line with the US position in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. This revision was apparently a key factor for Japan in joining the other elected members in sponsoring the draft resolution.

However, the US apparently still found that this formulation, which had been used to overcome similar differences during the [negotiations](https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/whatsinblue/2024/03/the-middle-east-including-the-palestinian-question-yesterdays-adoption-and-todays-briefing-and-consultations.php)
 on resolution 2728, fell short of its request for an explicit conditional link between the two demands, such as the one featured in resolution 2735. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether the US will accept this compromise and the draft in blue remains unchanged.

Language on persons detained by the parties still features virtually unchanged in the draft in blue, but as a stand-alone paragraph, which apparently reflects a US request not to suggest “an equivalence” between the hostages taken in Israel held captive by Palestinian armed groups and Palestinians prisoners detained by Israel by addressing them in the same paragraph.

Another major issue of contention was language in the early drafts of the resolution determining—in line with [Article 39](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7)
 of the UN Charter—that the situation in the Gaza Strip and the regional escalation constitute a threat to international peace and security. It seems, however, that the US still sought the deletion of this language, a request that was not reflected in the draft in blue.

It appears that the US also objected to language recalling the provisional orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in South Africa’s [case](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192)
 against Israel on the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip. It also rejects “any effort to starve Palestinians” and demands immediate access to basic services and humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, and the facilitation of entry of humanitarian assistance at scale and its delivery, including to “civilians in besieged north Gaza”.

_Background_

This will be the twelfth time the Security Council votes on a draft resolution on the war in Gaza."

Content: "could not support the unconditional ceasefire that failed to release the hostages.  “We heard that some desired the US veto rather than a consensus product,” he observed, emphasizing that his Government has done more than any other country to improve the humanitarian conditions in Gaza.

“The draft resolution this Council failed to adopt today sought only to break its deafening silence,” stressed Algeria’s delegate, noting that the text, although far from ideal, represented a “bare minimum that should have united us”.  Instead, today’s message to Israel is that “you may continue your genocide” and “in this Chamber, you enjoy immunity”, he said, adding that the message to Palestinians is also clear:  “While the overwhelming majority of the world stands in solidarity with your plight, tragically, others remain indifferent to your suffering.”

The representative of the Russian Federation stated:  “We will not allow the United States to muzzle the voice of the Council and continue emboldening further merciless operations by Israel”, calling Washington, D.C.’s “cold and cynical” opposition to saving lives — “inhumane”.  “You today have definitively shown that you are fully responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent civilians,” he continued, observing that, if adopted, the resolution would have sent a clear signal to the parties to end violence and move to a diplomatic settlement.

In the same vein, China’s delegate said that the United States’ long use of the veto has dashed the hope of people of Gaza of survival.  Noting that “so-called” diplomatic negotiations — conducted by the United States — have seen no progress, he observed that its continued weapons supply has become a decisive factor in the war lasting so long.  “Insistence on setting a precondition to ceasefire is tantamount to giving a green light to continuing war”, he said, stating that Israel’s military operation has long exceeded the scope of rescuing hostages.

Meanwhile, the representative of Ecuador pointed out that, for the second time in 2024, the 10 elected Council members “accepted the challenge” of drafting a text that would be acceptable to all the organ’s members and would allow it to fulfil its responsibilities “in the face of a pressing situation”.  “Fourteen votes in favour are a clear indication that the draft resolution put forward was ‘timely and appropriate’”, he stated. Adding to that France’s delegate stated that “international humanitarian law is being trampled underfoot”.

“There is an entire generation of children in Gaza we are failing,” lamented Slovenia’s delegate, joined by the representatives of the Republic of Korea and Malta in regretting the non-adoption of the text.  Japan’s representative added that without collective action, “children in Gaza — the future of Gaza — will continue to pay the high price of this conflict”. For his part, Sierra Leone’s delegate emphasized that, if adopted, the text would have allowed the Council to “unite its strength to save humanity from destruction”.

Offering a different perspective, the speaker for Switzerland underscored that Israel, as an occupying Power, has a duty to ensure that the basic needs in the occupied Palestinian territories are met.  “Israel must take urgent action to alleviate this crisis,” stressed the United Kingdom’s delegate, Council President for November, speaking in her national capacity. Voicing regret that consensus was not reached, she affirmed her country’s unwavering commitment to realize the vision of the text.

However, the representative of Israel said that today’s resolution was not a path to peace — “it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed”. “Many of you attempted to pass this injustice,” he added, thanking the United States for using its veto and refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.  Had the text passed, the Council would have sent a message to the world that terrorists can act with impunity and would have “validated their \[Hamas\] strategy of using human shields, targeting civilians and tormenting hostages in their terror dungeons”.

Further, “it would have set a horrifying precedent that terrorism pays”, he said — “that violence is met not with condemnation, but with concessions”.  The Council has already adopted four resolutions demanding the release of hostages, and Hamas has ignored them all.  While the loss of civilian life in Gaza is a tragedy, he stressed that “it is a tragedy authored by Hamas”.  He concluded:  “If Hamas were to release the hostages and surrender their weapons, not one more shot would need to be fired; but, until that day comes, Israel will do whatever it takes to protect its people and bring our loved ones home.”

“The world should not grow accustomed to the death of Palestinians,” stressed the observer of the State of Palestine, adding:  “Maybe — for some — we have the wrong nationality, the wrong faith, the wrong skin colour; but we are humans, and we should be treated as such.”  Although a ceasefire “doesn’t resolve everything, but it is the first step to resolving anything”, he said.  Questioning whether international law applies differently to Israel than to the rest of the world, he asked:  “What the hell does Israel need to do more for this Council to act under Chapter VII?”  The world is witnessing an attempt to annihilate a nation, and yet the very tools designed to respond to such a situation are not being used. 

“This self-inflicted powerlessness has to stop,” he urged.  The message that would have been sent by today’s resolution — trying to save lives — was not a dangerous one; rather, its veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans.  “And the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time,” he stressed.  Adding that, one day, people will examine the records of these meetings and wonder how a genocide known to the whole world was able to continue for so long, he stated:  “It is because we are allowed to speak about the rules, but not to enforce them.”

Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Demanding Immediate Ceasefire in Gaza, as United States Casts Negative Vote
======================================================================================================================

The Security Council today failed to adopt a text, put forward by its 10 elected members, that called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and demanded the release of all hostages, on account of a negative vote cast by a permanent member.

Introducing the draft resolution, the representative of Guyana said the text was prompted by the Council’s deep concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and a need for an urgent response.  She observed that the release of hostages is one of the most important provisions of the text.  Spotlighting broad consensus, she noted that, while several divergent positions have found a balance in the text, the dominant concern has been to provide a legally binding obligation to end the hostilities.

Although the vote that followed garnered support for the resolution from 14 Council members, the text was not adopted due to a veto cast by the United States.

If adopted, the resolution would have demanded Gaza’s civilian population be given access to basic services, while it would have rejected any effort to starve Palestinians and would have demanded humanitarian assistance at scale.  Further, it would have also demanded the release of hostages, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners and the return of Palestinian civilians to all areas in Gaza, as it would have also underscored that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) remains a backbone of humanitarian response.

However, the representative of the United States said that “this resolution would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas:  there is no need to come back to the negotiating table”, recalling that the group has rejected “deal after deal after deal”.  More so, Washington, D.C. Not an official record.

However, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had enough support to carry out that plan, and because Wilson had just started his second term, the former President's prospects for substantial political gain seemed dubious.\[_[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")\

The [Selective Service Act of 1917](/wiki/Selective_Service_Act_of_1917 "Selective Service Act of 1917")
 was carefully drawn to remedy the defects in the Civil War system and—by allowing exemptions for dependency, essential occupations, and religious scruples—to place each man in his proper niche in a national war effort.[\[18\]](#cite_note-18)
 The act established a "liability for military service of all male citizens"; authorized a selective draft of all those between 21 and 31 years of age (later from 18 to 45); and prohibited all forms of bounties, substitutions, or purchase of exemptions. Baker")

 Many of these sentences were commuted after the war's end.

In 1917, a number of radicals and [anarchists](/wiki/Anarchists "Anarchists")
, including [Emma Goldman](/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman")
, tried to challenge the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the [Thirteenth Amendment](/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution")
's prohibition against [slavery and involuntary servitude](/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States")
. Congress further tweaked this act in 1950 although the post–World War II surplus of military manpower left little need for draft calls until [President Truman's](/wiki/Harry_S._Truman "Harry S. During the active combat phase, the possibility of avoiding combat by selecting their service and military specialty led as many as four out of 11 eligible men to enlist.[\[53\]](#cite_note-Useem-53)
[\[54\]](#cite_note-54)
 The military relied upon draft-induced volunteerism to meet its quotas, especially for the Army, which accounted for nearly 95% of all inductees during the Vietnam War era. If drafted, they would only serve for two years, but would have no choice over their military occupational specialty.[\[68\]](#cite_note-68)

Of the nearly 16 million men not engaged in active military service, 96% were exempted (typically because of jobs including other military service), deferred (usually for educational reasons), or disqualified (usually for physical and mental deficiencies but also for criminal records including draft violations).[\[29\]](#cite_note-autogenerated2-29)
 The requirements for obtaining and maintaining an educational deferment changed several times in the late 1960s. Gates initially opposed the all-volunteer army idea but changed his mind during the course of the 15-member commission's work.[\[73\]](#cite_note-aitken-73)

 The existing draft law was expiring at the end of June 1971, but the Department of Defense and Nixon administration decided the draft needed to continue for at least some time.[\[76\]](#cite_note-griffith-76)
 In February 1971, the administration requested Congress to extend the draft for two years, to June 1973.[\[77\]](#cite_note-nyt020371-77)
[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)

Senatorial opponents of the war wanted to reduce this to a one-year extension, eliminate the draft altogether, or tie the draft renewal to a timetable for troop withdrawal from Vietnam;[\[79\]](#cite_note-nyt060571-79)
 Senator [Mike Gravel](/wiki/Mike_Gravel "Mike Gravel")
 of [Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska")
 took the most forceful approach, trying to [filibuster](/wiki/Filibuster "Filibuster")
 the draft renewal legislation, shut conscription down, and directly force an end to the war.[\[80\]](#cite_note-80)
 Senators supporting Nixon's war efforts supported the bill even though some had qualms about ending the draft.[\[78\]](#cite_note-black-78)
 After a prolonged battle in the Senate, a September 1971 [cloture](/wiki/Cloture "Cloture")
 was achieved over the filibuster, and the draft renewal bill was approved.[\[81\]](#cite_note-nyt092271-81)
 Meanwhile, military pay was increased as an incentive to attract volunteers, and television advertising for the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the act, stating that Congress's "decision to exempt women was not the accidental byproduct of a traditional way of thinking about women", that "since women are excluded from combat service by statute or military policy, men and women are simply not similarly situated for purposes of a draft or registration for a draft, and Congress' decision to authorize the registration of only men therefore does not violate the Due Process Clause", and that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than 'equity.'"[\[112\]](#cite_note-112)

The _Rostker v. Though the conclusion of the meeting memo did not call for a reinstatement of the draft, it did suggest Selective Service Act modifications to include registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills that could serve to meet military, homeland-defense, and humanitarian needs.[\[133\]](#cite_note-133)
 This hinted at more targeted draft options being considered, perhaps like that of the "Doctor Draft" that began in the 1950s to provide nearly 66% of the medical professionals who served in the Army in Korea.[\[134\]](#cite_note-134)
 Once created, this manpower tool continued to be used through 1972."

Conscription — a practice most Americans [believe should be](https://news.gallup.com/poll/28642/vast-majority-americans-opposed-reinstituting-military-draft.aspx)
 relegated to the dustbin of history — has returned as an uncomfortable topic of conversation among U.S. [allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
 and [adversaries](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-signs-decree-spring-military-conscription-2024-03-31/)
 alike. This has generated [concern](https://theconversation.com/us-kicks-off-debate-on-conscription-as-other-nato-members-introduce-drafts-232458)
 and even [conspiracy theories](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/06/18/men-draft-selective-service-fact-check/74124846007/)
 among American voters. [France](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-04-05/ukraine-conscription-military-service-panic-isn-t-what-europe-needs?embedded-checkout=true)
, which ended conscription in 1996, and [Germany](https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-conscription-boris-pistorius-military-service-ukraine-war-bundeswehr/)
, which ended conscription in 2011, have recently begun political debates about the potential for future conscription. What would that look like?

A recent proposal to [automate](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2024/05/23/lawmakers-move-to-automate-selective-service-registration-for-all-men/)

 to include all Americans has generated [public rumors](https://thedispatch.com/article/mandatory-registration-for-the-draft-isnt-new-contrary-to-social-media-posts/)
 that the nation is on a wartime footing. The all-volunteer force provides a smaller but [more professionalized](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3316678/all-volunteer-force-proves-successful-for-us-military/)
 force than its predecessor, increasing the standards of those who serve across [metrics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9195.html)
 including mental aptitude, physical strength, training, and unit cohesion.

Yet just because the United States transitioned to volunteers does not mean that the nation would never need to call upon a draft in the future. Over the course of the conflict, more than [19 million men](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/unfit-for-service-physical-fitness-and-civic-obligation-in-world-war-ii.htm#:~:text=Over%2520the%2520course%2520of%2520World,disqualified%2520people%2520from%2520military%2520service.)
 were drafted.

Americans tend to look at conscription during the world wars through the lens of nostalgia, with the perception that these conflicts were more pure expressions of good versus evil than in recent conflicts. In World War I, [15 percent](https://books.google.com/books/about/To_Raise_an_Army.html?id=n3veAAAAMAAJ)
 of men refused to register with Selective Service and a further 12 percent of those drafted deserted the military after induction. When the demand for and deployment of conscripts increased as the United States entrenched itself in Vietnam, resistance to the draft grew rapidly.

In the years since the transition to the all-volunteer force, any [discussion](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20219330)
 of [reintroducing](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2011/10/05/chapter-5-the-public-and-the-military/)
 conscription has generated fear of returning to the [Vietnam](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/us-military-draft-iran-selective-service-system)
\-era [draft](https://www.newsweek.com/biden-military-draft-rumors-swirl-after-iran-attacks-1865063)
. At the same time, some commentators have recommended conscription as a [solution](https://www.yahoo.com/news/military-recruitment-shortfall-us-bring-162655292.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA7JeTY-8r59u5hTXfOuGskSzzpIFddCzifP3prJZkmJmxxTaN9HnyaxjuQGrEGmIGQGXqXu5QctMJlY4DAeColgGBzRQUJ_eznVmZ50R0Ke3TlsEmrOeLhLSrQOJvJgA8cPrmlay5lrVkRSXdkXQUYi9D53yAZ5APEWDiyc6Hc4&guccounter=2)
 to the military’s recruiting troubles or as a way to reinvigorate [civic duty](https://time.com/5696950/bring-back-the-draft/)
 among an apathetic American populace.

Yet the threshold to execute a draft is high — as it should be."

Jerusalem  — 

As the earliest stages of a [massive assault](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 on Gaza City take shape, Israel is calling up tens of thousands of reservists to take part in the impending military operation.

The takeover and occupation of the largest city in northern Gaza, which Israel’s Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/09/middleeast/nentanyahu-israel-gaza-analysis-intl)
 said was one of the last Hamas strongholds, will require the military to bring in 60,000 more reserve troops and extend the service of another 20,000.

Those plans have sparked growing condemnation [both internationally and domestically](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/10/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-intl-latam-hnk)
 over fears that the spiraling humanitarian and hunger crisis in Gaza will worsen – and that the lives of the remaining hostages will be further at risk from an expanded military operation.

The Israeli military is already on the outskirts of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Brig. He [told CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-terror-attack/)
 in an interview in February of last year that once Israel invaded Rafah in southern Gaza, “the intense phase of the fighting is weeks away from completion, not months, weeks away from completion.”

Now, 18 months later, Netanyahu says a new operation is the fastest way to end Israel’s longest war.

But that operation also targets a city that is home to more than a million people, many of them already displaced from other parts of Gaza.

More than 22 months since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attacks, over 2 million people in Gaza have been struggling with severe hunger, disease and displacement amid Israel’s siege.

Cases of child malnutrition have tripled across Gaza in “less than six months,” according to the United Nations, as humanitarian workers [urged Israel](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fpress-releases%2F2025%2F08%2Fgaza-israel-must-restore-un-humanitarian-system-stave-starvation-say-un&data=05%7C02%7Cjerome.taylor%40cnn.com%7Cac449314fcdd4420e59b08dde02dbaa9%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638913209256057834%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZFc6p7J7iZRcGh9Y8O%2BDrA9RqOX7abUnaTHPbP56Osg%3D&reserved=0)
 to lift severe restrictions on aid entering the besieged enclave.

Nearly 1 in 3 children are malnourished in Gaza City, said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) in what he called a “a man-made, preventable starvation”.

Netanyahu’s government have repeatedly denied that starvation is rife in the enclave.

The Israeli military has a relatively small active-duty force, comprised mostly of conscripts. Effie Defrin said Wednesday, in what he described as the first steps of the larger operation.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military also said it has begun warning medical officials and international aid organizations in northern Gaza to plan for mass evacuation and displacement of the Palestinian population ahead of the planned Gaza City takeover.

The forced evacuation of the healthcare system risks worsening an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis gripping the besieged territory.

An Israeli military official told CNN that there will be “several steps” before Israeli ground forces move into the city. To continue fighting what has become the country’s longest war ever, Israel has to rely on reservists.

But it’s not clear what percentage will answer a new round of calls to serve inside Gaza once again, especially after the military chief warned the operation could endanger the soldiers and the hostages.

Defrin, the military spokesman, tried to address those concerns Wednesday, saying at a press conference that the IDF uses “intelligence and many other capabilities” to protect the lives of the hostages. “The war is over a year ago,” said Halutz, describing the current plan as having “no logic.” The retired general was careful not to call on Israelis to refuse to serve, but he encouraged reservists to “act according to his conscience, to his set of rules.”

Netanyahu promised more than a year ago that the worst of the fighting would be over by now. The IDF has begun preparing for the city’s evacuation by sending in more tents for displaced Palestinians, but evacuation warnings have not yet been issued.

When Israel’s security cabinet first approved the takeover of Gaza City, Israeli officials estimated the plan could take five months or more. But on Wednesday, Netanyahu instructed the military to shorten the timeline.

After nearly [two years of war](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-gaza-war-expansion-explainer-intl)
, and with no end in sight amid the next major operation, Israel’s military chief warned of the added burden on the troops, many of whom have been called up multiple times to fight in Gaza. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet earlier this month that the military faced attrition and burnout, but his concerns were dismissed as Netanyahu and his coalition partners pushed ahead with the new war plans.

A new survey from the Agam Labs at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggested that approximately 40% of soldiers were slightly or significantly less motivated to serve, while a little more than 13% were more motivated."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence indicates that the US did not reinstitute the draft for the Israel-Hamas war in 2024. A fact-check from ABC10 explicitly states that there was no such draft. While there are discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act, and the possibility of a draft, these are not directly linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

The provided sources discuss the history of conscription in the United States and the possibility of a draft, but they do not confirm the claim. The ABC10 fact-check explicitly refutes the claim.

The provided evidence does not mention the reinstitution of the draft in the US. The search results focus on a UN Security Council draft resolution related to the Israel-Hamas war and the US's veto of it.

The claim cannot be verified due to a lack of information.


## Actions
```
web_search("US military draft 2024")
web_search("US Selective Service System Israel-Hamas war")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided web sources discuss the history of conscription in the United States, including the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the end of the draft in 1973. One source mentions a 2024 meeting memo suggesting modifications to the Selective Service Act, such as registration by women and self-reporting of critical skills. Another article discusses the possibility of a draft in the US, mentioning public rumors about the nation being on a wartime footing.

The sources include a Wikipedia article on conscription in the United States ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States)) and an article from War on the Rocks ([https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/](https://warontherocks.com/2024/08/preparing-for-the-possibility-of-a-draft-without-panic/)).


### Evidence from `web_search`
The ABC10 article fact-checks the claim that the US military draft was reinstituted for the Israel-Hamas war, published in 2025 by Google LLC ([https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/verify/israel-hamas-war/no-us-military-draft-executive-order-israel-hamas-war-fact-check/536-e5115746-d86f-45a1-bf43-f180d76f13e0)). The USO is supporting American troops during the Israel-Hamas war ([https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war](https://www.uso.org/israel-hamas-war)).

CNN published an article on August 20, 2025, discussing potential manpower issues for the Israeli military, including calling up reservists and extending service, and the possibility of drafting ultra-Orthodox men (<image:k>, <image:j>) ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-city-offensive-manpower-latam-intl)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the US did not reinstitute the draft for the Israel-Hamas war in 2024. A fact-check from ABC10 explicitly states that there was no such draft. While there are discussions about potential modifications to the Selective Service Act, and the possibility of a draft, these are not directly linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

The provided sources discuss the history of conscription in the United States and the possibility of a draft, but they do not confirm the claim. The ABC10 fact-check explicitly refutes the claim.

* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:64> This is an authentic image of Dwayne Johnson waring the Israeli flag in support of Israel."

## Actions
```
image_search("Dwayne Johnson Israeli flag")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Euronews published an article about Dwayne Johnson, but it does not contain any information about the Israeli flag. ([https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/14/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-political-parties-asked-him-to-run-for-president](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/11/14/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-political-parties-asked-him-to-run-for-president))

WIONews published an image of Dwayne Johnson. <image:9093> Variety published an article about Hollywood stars supporting Israel, which includes a picture of Dwayne Johnson. <image:9094>


## Elaboration
The evidence includes an image of Dwayne Johnson expressing his feelings about the conflict in the Middle East, but it does not show him wearing the Israeli flag. Another image shows Dwayne Johnson, but it does not include the Israeli flag. The Euronews article does not mention the Israeli flag.

The claim cannot be verified with the provided evidence. More information is needed to confirm if the image is authentic.

# Search Result

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.
