Useful result: From [Source](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greta-thunberg-laughs-as-she-shouts-fk-israel-at-german-rally-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116164532.cms): 
Content: The Times of India reported on December 10, 2024, that Greta Thunberg said "f\*\*k Israel" at an anti-Israel rally in Mannheim, Germany. The article mentions criticism from pro-Israel communities and a conservative leader. <image:116165153>

The claim '<image:29> This is an authentic image of Greta Thunberg from November 2024 holding a sign reading, 'Fuck Israel'.' is false.
Justification: The evidence confirms that Greta Thunberg has expressed anti-Israel sentiments, including saying "f\*\*k Israel" at a rally in Germany in December 2024, as reported by the Times of India ([https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greta-thunberg-laughs-as-she-shouts-fk-israel-at-german-rally-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116164532.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greta-thunberg-laughs-as-she-shouts-fk-israel-at-german-rally-video-goes-viral/articleshow/116164532.cms)). However, the authenticity of the image in the claim cannot be verified.

So, the overall veracity is: false
