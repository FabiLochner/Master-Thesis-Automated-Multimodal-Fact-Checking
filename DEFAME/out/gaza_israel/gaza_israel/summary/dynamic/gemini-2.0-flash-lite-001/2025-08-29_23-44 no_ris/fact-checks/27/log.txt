The claim '<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported. While protests occurred in France in 2024, and the image's geolocation suggests it was taken there, the evidence does not definitively confirm that the image depicts the "French Left" rioting. The presence of a swastika in the image raises concerns that require further investigation.

So, the overall veracity is: false
