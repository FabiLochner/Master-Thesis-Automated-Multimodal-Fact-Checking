On January 24, 2025, a memorandum was issued to reinstate the Mexico City Policy. The article does not mention an executive order regarding UNRWA funding on January 20, 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://refugees.org/uscri-summary-of-january-20-executive-orders/): 
Content: The United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) published a summary of Executive Orders released by the White House on January 20, 2025 (<image:8360>). The summary covers several Executive Orders, including one on protecting the United States from foreign terrorists, securing borders, realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program, protecting the American people against invasion, protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship, and putting America first in international environmental agreements. The summary also mentions a Proclamation guaranteeing the States Protection Against Invasion. The USCRI's statement on each Executive Order is available on their website. The article was published on January 24, 2025.
