Useful result: From [Source](https://www.madamasr.com/en/2025/08/28/feature/politics/the-new-syria-under-israeli-american-construction/): 
Content: The article from madamasr.com, published on August 28, 2025, discusses the situation in Syria after the fall of Assad.

Useful result: From [Source](https://futureuae.com/blog.rar/Mainpage/Item/10126/possible-scenarios-where-is-the-turkish-israeli-rivalry-in-syria-headed): 
Content: The article from futureuae.com, published on April 23, 2025, discusses the rivalry between Turkey and Israel in Syria. It mentions that on March 10, 2025, an agreement was reached between Syrian President al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, which undermined Israel's attempts to manipulate the Kurdish issue. The article also mentions a meeting between Trump and Netanyahu on April 7, where Trump asserted his ability to resolve any disagreement with Erdogan over Syria. <image:8878>

The claim 'Turkey's President urged the U.S. in March 2025 to control its ally Israel over its intervention in southern Syria in February 2025.' is false.
Justification: The evidence does not support the claim. While there were interactions between Turkey, Israel, Syria, and the U.S. in March 2025, the search results do not mention Erdogan urging the U.S. to control Israel. Specifically, a JINSA report ([Source](https://jinsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Erdogan-Israels-Destruction-2025.pdf)) indicates that Erdogan made statements against Israel on March 30, 2025, but not that he urged the U.S. to control Israel.

So, the overall veracity is: false
