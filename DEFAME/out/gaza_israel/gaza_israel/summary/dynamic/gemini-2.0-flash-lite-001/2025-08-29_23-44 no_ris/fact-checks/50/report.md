## Actions
```
web_search("DNA testing legality Israel")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Harvard University article, published in 2015 by Oxford University Press, discusses the use of genetic tests in Israel to determine if potential immigrants are Jewish (<image:k> [Source](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b)). Another article from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, "Genetic citizenship: DNA testing and the Israeli Law of Return," examines the potential use of genetic tests to determine Jewish identity for immigration purposes (<image:k> [Source](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html)).

Nature.com discusses a bill proposing stringent restrictions on the use of genetic information in Israel, which was passed by the Israeli parliament's science committee (<image:k> [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247)).


## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, as it is used for immigration purposes and is subject to legal restrictions.
2.  The provided sources discuss the use of genetic tests to determine Jewish identity for immigration and a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information.
3.  The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that DNA testing is not illegal in Israel, but rather subject to legal restrictions and used for specific purposes like immigration. The sources mention the use of genetic tests and a bill proposing restrictions, which contradicts the claim. `false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. Evidence from [Harvard University](https://dash.harvard.edu/entities/publication/73120379-1b48-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b) and [Harvard Kennedy School of Government](https://ideas.repec.org/p/hrv/hksfac/29408321.html) indicates that DNA testing is used in Israel, particularly for immigration purposes. Additionally, [Nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/28247) discusses a bill proposing restrictions on the use of genetic information, further suggesting that DNA testing is not illegal but regulated.
