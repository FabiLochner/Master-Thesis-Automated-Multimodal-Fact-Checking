### Evidence from `web_search`
The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-18/gal-gadot-walk-of-fame-pro-palestine-pro-israel-protesters-snow-white](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-03-18/gal-gadot-walk-of-fame-pro-palestine-pro-israel-protesters-snow-white)) and Entertainment Weekly ([https://ew.com/fact-check-was-gal-gadot-s-hollywood-star-destroyed-11700747?srsltid=AfmBOop90p4riItENYAoYHyIWv-yrIB5GIgeKGqAsLTSAZq-VEQRVwTS](https://ew.com/fact-check-was-gal-gadot-s-hollywood-star-destroyed-11700747?srsltid=AfmBOop90p4riItENYAoYHyIWv-yrIB5GIgeKGqAsLTSAZq-VEQRVwTS)) reported on Gal Gadot's Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony on March 18, 2025, which was disrupted by protesters. The Los Angeles Times article includes a photo of the aftermath of vandalism, and Entertainment Weekly mentions a viral post depicting a vandalized star, but it is unclear if the images are original or manipulated.

Fox LA ([https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized](https://www.foxla.com/news/gal-gadot-star-walk-of-fame-vandalized)) reported that Gadot's star was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker. ![image 15](media/18.jpg)

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. The Los Angeles Times and Entertainment Weekly reported on the ceremony and the subsequent vandalism. Fox LA reported that the star was vandalized with the words "baby killer" and a sticker. The image search also provided images of the vandalized star. The claim is partially supported by the evidence. However, the claim states that the vandalism occurred hours after the star was placed, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Gal Gadot's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized. However, the claim states that the vandalism occurred hours after the star was placed, which is not explicitly stated in the evidence. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
