Useful result: From [Source](https://www.voanews.com/a/extremism-watch_afghan-officials-irans-new-quds-chief-likely-faked-identity-2018/6182322.html): 
Content: VOA News reports that Esmail Qaani, the new head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, visited Bamiyan province in Afghanistan in 2018, claiming to be the Iranian Deputy Chief of Mission in Kabul. Afghan officials are investigating the visit, as Qaani never served in a diplomatic capacity in Afghanistan. The article includes a photo of Qaani in Bamiyan.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aol.com/fact-check-no-iranian-general-023005797.html): 
Content: AOL fact-checked a claim that Esmail Qaani was seen in Israel and was an Israeli asset. The claim was debunked. Misbar also debunked the claim. The outlet reported that Qaani was seen at rallies in February 2025.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-858988): 
Content: The Jerusalem Post published an article discussing whether Esmail Qaani is still alive, mentioning his wariness of assassination. The article includes a photo of Esmail Qaani. <image:1>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esmail_Qaani): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on Esmail Qaani states that he is an Iranian brigadier general and commander of the IRGC Quds Force. It mentions that Qaani was born in Mashhad and, according to The Sun, was allegedly placed under house arrest and interrogated on accusations of being an Israeli spy. The article also mentions that there have been unverified reports concerning Qaani's death. <image:7803>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202410101144): 
Content: The search result from Iran International discusses conflicting reports about Esmail Qaani's health and whereabouts. It mentions that Qaani has not been seen in public since an Israeli air strike. The article includes satirical images depicting Qaani in an Israeli military uniform. <image:9074>

The claim '<image:57> This is an authentic image of Esmail Qaani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, disguised in a hijab in fear of Israeli bombing.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unproven. While Esmail Qaani has used a fake identity, there's no definitive proof the person in the image is him. The image's context is unclear, and it could be satirical.

So, the overall veracity is: false
