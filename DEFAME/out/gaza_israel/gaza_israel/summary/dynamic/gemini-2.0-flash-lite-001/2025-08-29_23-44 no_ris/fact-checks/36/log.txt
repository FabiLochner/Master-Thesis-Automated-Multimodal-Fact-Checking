Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/strike-on-iran-will-make-world-understand-israels-might-says-defence-minister): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 23, 2024, discussing the Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant's statements regarding a planned strike on Iran. <image:8529>. The article mentions an Iranian missile attack on October 1, which was a reprisal for Israel’s killing of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The article also mentions that the Middle East has been braced for more than three weeks for a threatened Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The claim 'Gallant, a retired military general and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet, was killed in the Iranian attack on Israel on October 1, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from multiple sources, including an article from NPR, indicates that Yoav Gallant was alive after the Iranian attack on October 1, 2024, and was later fired from his position as Defense Minister.

So, the overall veracity is: false
