## Evidence

From [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry3jzedl1o): 
Content: The BBC published an article on February 21, 2025, discussing the Bibas family. ![image 1071](media/2025-07-20_10-12-1753006377-995573.jpg), ![image 1072](media/2025-07-20_10-12-1753006378-119488.jpg).

The article is authored by George Wright & Mallory Moench.


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_and_killing_of_the_Bibas_family): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the kidnapping and killing of the Bibas family. It mentions that Hamas claimed the family was killed by an Israeli airstrike, while Israel stated they were killed by their captors. The article also mentions that the bodies of Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir Bibas were returned on February 20, and that a forensic analysis showed they were killed with "bare hands". ![image 21](media/30.jpg) The article also references a BBC article.


## Elaboration
The BBC did publish an article about the Bibas family on February 21, 2025. The article discussed the conflicting claims regarding the family's death, with Hamas stating they were killed by an Israeli airstrike and Israel claiming they were killed by their captors. The evidence confirms the existence of a BBC article on the Bibas family, but it does not confirm the exact wording of the headline in the image.

The evidence does not confirm the exact wording of the headline in the image. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified.
