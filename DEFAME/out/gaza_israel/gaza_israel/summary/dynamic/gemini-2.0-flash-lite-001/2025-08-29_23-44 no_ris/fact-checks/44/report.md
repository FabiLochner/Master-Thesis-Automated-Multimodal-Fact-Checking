The articles, from [JNS.org](https://www.jns.org/biden-photographed-exiting-nantucket-shop-with-anti-israel-book/), [Jewish Insider](https://jewishinsider.com/2024/12/joe-biden-the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine-rashid-khalidi/) and [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion), mention the book's controversial nature and the reactions it sparked. The Fox News article was published on November 24, 2023, and includes additional images: ![image 6255](media/2025-08-29_19-46-1756496795-371546.jpg), ![image 6264](media/2025-08-29_19-46-1756496799-759773.jpg), ![image 6259](media/2025-08-29_19-46-1756496798-281641.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image shows President Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks while holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine." The event occurred in late November 2023, not 2024, as indicated by the Fox News article published on November 24, 2023.


## Final Judgement
The image does show President Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book. However, the event occurred in late November 2023, not 2024.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image accurately depicts President Joe Biden exiting Nantucket Bookworks holding a copy of Rashid Khalidi's book, "The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine." However, the event occurred in late November 2023, as reported by sources like [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-seen-holding-anti-israel-book-black-friday-shopping-excursion), not in late November 2024 as the claim states.
