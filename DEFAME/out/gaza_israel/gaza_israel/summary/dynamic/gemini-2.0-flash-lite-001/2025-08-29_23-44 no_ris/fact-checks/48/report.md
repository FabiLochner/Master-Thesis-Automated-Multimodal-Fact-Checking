## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Reuters reports that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal (![image 4075](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909974-533843.jpg)). The article does not mention Trump telling Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign. The article was published on August 15, 2024. [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)

Newsweek published an article discussing allegations that Donald Trump called Benjamin Netanyahu on August 14 to discuss a ceasefire deal (![image 4080](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909982-447907.jpg), ![image 4081](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909983-160119.jpg)). Trump and Netanyahu both denied the call took place. The article also mentions that Trump met with Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago on July 26. [Source](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-accused-crime-benjamin-netanyahu-call-ceasefire-hamas-1942248) NPR published an article on August 14, 2024, discussing the resumption of Gaza cease-fire talks (![image 4093](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909991-227394.jpg), ![image 4092](media/2025-08-23_00-46-1755909989-387454.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, the Reuters article does not mention Trump's alleged motivations. The Newsweek article mentions allegations of the call but also states that both Trump and Netanyahu denied it.

The claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence does not confirm that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal because it would help Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaign.


## Final Judgement
The available evidence confirms that Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to help Kamala Harris's campaign. In fact, one source states that both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
While Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly spoke on August 14, 2024, and discussed the Gaza ceasefire, there is no evidence from sources like Reuters ([Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-netanyahu-speak-about-gaza-hostage-ceasefire-deal-axios-reports-2024-08-15/)) to support the claim that Trump told Netanyahu to stop the deal to help Kamala Harris's campaign. Furthermore, Newsweek reported that both Trump and Netanyahu denied the call took place.
