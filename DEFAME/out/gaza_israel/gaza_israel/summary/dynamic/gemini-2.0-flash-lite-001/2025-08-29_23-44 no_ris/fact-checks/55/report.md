## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 7, 2024, Donald Trump was interviewed by Hugh Hewitt. During the interview, Trump stated that he had been to Gaza. The transcript of the interview can be found here: [Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hugh-hewitt-radio-october-7-2024).

However, reports from The Media Line ([Source](https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/ex-president-trump-misstates-gaza-visit-in-hugh-hewitt-interview/)) and The New York Times ([Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/politics/trump-gaza-israel.html)) indicate that Trump did not visit Gaza, but visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017. ![image 332](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846018-131545.jpg), ![image 333](media/2025-07-18_13-40-1752846018-456021.jpg), <image:k>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Donald Trump stated in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, "I’ve been there" regarding Gaza. However, the evidence also indicates that Trump did not visit Gaza. He visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate as Trump made the statement, but factually incorrect as he did not visit Gaza.


## Final Judgement
The claim is partially accurate because Donald Trump did make the statement in the interview. However, it is factually inaccurate because he did not visit Gaza.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Donald Trump did state in an interview with Hugh Hewitt on October 7, 2024, that he had been to Gaza, as evidenced by the interview transcript ([Source](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-hugh-hewitt-radio-october-7-2024)). However, reports from The Media Line and The New York Times indicate that Trump did not visit Gaza, but visited Israel and the West Bank in 2017.
