## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) published a summary of its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, regarding the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, finding Israel's continued presence unlawful. The ICJ stated that Israel must end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. All states and international organizations are obligated not to recognize the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence. The UN Secretary-General presented a report on the advisory opinion on December 19, 2024.

The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect published an article on April 21, 2025, discussing the ICJ's July 2024 Advisory Opinion, which stated that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful. The ICJ affirmed that Israelâ€™s occupation of the oPt is illegal under international law and called on the Israeli government to cease settlement activities, withdraw settlers, and provide full reparations. ![image 756](media/2025-07-18_21-40-1752874842-948189.jpg)

## Elaboration
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion in July 2024 regarding Israel's policies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The ICJ found Israel's presence unlawful and stated that Israel must end its unlawful presence, cease settlement activities, and make reparations. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful.


## Final Judgement
The ICJ's advisory opinion in July 2024 found Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful, not that Israel is an illegal state. The ICJ called for an end to the unlawful presence, cessation of settlement activities, and reparations.

The claim is not factually accurate because it misrepresents the ICJ's ruling. The ICJ did not declare Israel an illegal state, but rather found its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful. `false`
