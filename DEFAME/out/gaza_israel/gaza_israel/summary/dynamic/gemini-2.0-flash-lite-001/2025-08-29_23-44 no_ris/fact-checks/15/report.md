### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.85, 'Canada': 0.07, 'Germany': 0.02, 'Austria': 0.01, 'Israel': 0.01, 'Poland': 0.01, 'Slovenia': 0.01, 'South Korea': 0.01, 'Albania': 0.0, 'Andorra': 0.0}

### Evidence from `web_search`
In July 2024, electronic traffic signs in Montreal displayed pro-Palestinian slogans, including "Free Palestine" and "Escalate now" (![image 13](media/15.jpg)). These signs were altered at construction sites, and the original messages were restored. The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism.

The City of Montreal has a history of removing pro-Palestine signs. Jeremy Levi, the mayor of Hampstead, called on Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante to take a stand against the signs.
The Jerusalem Post reported on electronic street signs in Montreal displaying "Globalize the intifada".

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Suburban published an article stating that Mayor Valérie Plante was served by bailiff regarding pro-Palestinian electronic signs used in construction areas, which displayed messages such as "Free Palestine. Valérie Plante needs to take concrete action." The police are investigating the incident, which was claimed by a group called Clash MTL. ![image 8320](media/2025-08-29_23-48-1756511338-247016.jpg) shows a sign that says "INTIFADA NOW". The Montreal Gazette reports on a pro-Palestinian protest in Montreal on September 30, 2024, where demonstrators vandalized Concordia University and luxury stores. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the vandalism. ![image 13](media/15.jpg)

A CBC News article discusses an anti-NATO protest in Montreal where protesters demonstrated against the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions of protesters. The protest was organized by the Divest for Palestine collective and anti-capitalist group CLAC. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." in July 2024. The evidence confirms that similar signs appeared in Montreal during that time, but the city considered them vandalism. The evidence does not indicate that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante. In fact, the mayor condemned the actions related to the signs.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The image is of a sign in Montreal in July 2024. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying a "Free Palestine" message in July 2024. While the evidence confirms the presence of such signs, it also indicates that the city considered them vandalism and that the mayor did not authorize them.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image depicts a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine" in July 2024, which is supported by evidence from multiple sources, including a CBC News article ([https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-traffic-signs-pro-palestinian-slogans-1.7274809)). However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false, as the city considered the signs vandalism and the mayor condemned the actions.
