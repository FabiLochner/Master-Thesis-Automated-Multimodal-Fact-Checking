ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229](https://abcnews.go.com/International/ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-hamas-political-bureau-history/story?id=112430229)) published an article about Ismail Haniyeh.

The sources include images of Ismail Haniyeh (![image 8545](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511840-362183.jpg), ![image 8547](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511841-342494.jpg), ![image 8549](media/2025-08-29_23-57-1756511841-674443.jpg)).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran. The image provided in the claim is not directly linked to the assassination. The evidence does not provide details about the nature of the attack, such as whether it involved a single missile or the extent of the damage.

The claim that the image shows the assassination and describes a "precision strike" is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does not confirm the image's location or the method of attack.

Therefore, the claim is unsubstantiated due to the lack of evidence linking the image to the assassination and the absence of details about the attack's specifics.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated on July 31, 2024, but the provided image is not directly linked to the event. The evidence does not provide details about the nature of the attack.

The claim is not supported by the evidence because the image is not confirmed to be related to the assassination. The claim also describes the attack in detail, which is not supported by the evidence. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm Haniyeh's assassination on that date ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)), the provided image's location and relation to the event are not confirmed. The evidence does not provide details about the nature of the attack.
