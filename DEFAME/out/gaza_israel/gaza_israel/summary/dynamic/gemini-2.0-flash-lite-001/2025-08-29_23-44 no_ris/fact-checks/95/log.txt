The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image is likely from the Turkey earthquake, not Gaza, and the date is incorrect. The `geolocate` function indicates a high probability that the image was taken in Turkey. Image search results show similar images of people in orange jackets in rubble, with one source specifically linking the image to the Turkey earthquake in February 2023, contradicting the claim's context and date.

So, the overall veracity is: false
