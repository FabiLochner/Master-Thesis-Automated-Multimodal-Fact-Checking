## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Herzi Halevi served as the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces from January 16, 2023, to March 5, 2025, according to his Wikipedia page, which also mentions his resignation on March 5, 2025, and a report from September 12, 2024, that he was preparing to step down in December 2024. <image:i> Al Jazeera reported on January 21, 2025, that Halevi resigned due to failures related to the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack. <image:k>

The Jerusalem Post reported that Halevi ended his position as Chief of Staff earlier in March 2025 and was replaced by Eyal Zamir. <image:k> Another article from the Jerusalem Post mentions that Halevi failed to act on leaks to Smotrich. <image:j>


### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 13, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on an Israeli army base in Binyamina, north of Tel Aviv, resulting in four soldiers killed and over 60 injured (![image 1](media/0.jpg)). The attack is part of the Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present).

The attack on the Zar’it barracks, Golani Brigade Training Base, Israel, resulted in 4 soldiers killed and 58 wounded. The IDF is investigating how the drone entered Israel without triggering an alert. The Associated Press (AP) also reported on the attack, stating that it occurred near Binyamina city (<image:k>).

## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Herzi Halevi was not assassinated in a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024. While a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on that date, resulting in casualties, the provided sources do not mention Halevi being present or targeted in the attack. Furthermore, Halevi's Wikipedia page and other sources confirm that he served as the Chief of the General Staff until March 5, 2025, and resigned due to failures related to the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. While a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in that attack. The evidence indicates that Halevi was not present in the attack and resigned from his position later.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While a Hezbollah drone attack occurred on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, there is no evidence that Herzi Halevi was assassinated in that attack. Halevi served as the Chief of the General Staff until March 5, 2025, and resigned later, as reported by his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzi_Halevi).
