Useful result: From [Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-play-with-gaza-womens-underwear-online-posts-2024-03-28/): 
Content: The Reuters article, published on March 28, 2024, discusses Israeli soldiers posting photos and videos of themselves with lingerie found in Palestinian homes in Gaza. <image:8757> The article mentions that the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers.

The claim '<image:36> This image shows a Palestinian woman using an Israeli tank to dry clothes in Gaza in July 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts a Palestinian woman drying clothes on a tank in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, on July 5, 2024, as reported by [WSLS.com](https://www.wsls.com/news/world/2024/07/06/gazas-biggest-soccer-stadium-is-now-a-shelter-for-thousands-of-displaced-palestinians/) and [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-07-05/gazas-biggest-soccer-stadium-is-now-a-shelter-for-thousands-of-displaced-palestinians/). The evidence confirms the location and date. However, the evidence does not specify the tank's origin.

So, the overall veracity is: false
