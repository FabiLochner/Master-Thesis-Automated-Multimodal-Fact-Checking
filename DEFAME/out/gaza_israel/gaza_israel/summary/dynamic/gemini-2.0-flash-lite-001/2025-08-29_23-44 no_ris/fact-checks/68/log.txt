The claim '<image:41> This image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025, destroying its last remaining army depots.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image shows Israel bombing the surroundings of Southern Damascus in February 2025 is not fully supported. While evidence confirms that Israel struck military targets in Syria in February 2025, the specific image in the claim could not be verified, and the claim's assertion about the destruction of the last remaining army depots is not confirmed by the provided sources, including a report from The Guardian ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/25/israel-strikes-targets-in-southern-syria-after-demanding-demilitarisation)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
