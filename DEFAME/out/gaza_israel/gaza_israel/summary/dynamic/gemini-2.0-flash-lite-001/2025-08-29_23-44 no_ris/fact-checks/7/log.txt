Useful result: From [Source](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774): 
Content: The ABC News article, published on July 8, 2025, reports that Houthi rebels attacked ships in the Red Sea, killing mariners. The attacks are described as a "renewed campaign targeting a key maritime route." The article mentions that the attacks are the first since late 2024, after Trump's administration targeted the rebels in airstrikes.

Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the Red Sea crisis mentions a 2025 U.S.–Houthi ceasefire and a 2025 Houthi attack on Tel Aviv airport. It also mentions that on May 6, 2024, Donald Trump announced a cessation of US strikes as a result of a bilateral ceasefire between the US and the Houthis.

The claim 'The Huthi rebels announced the final cessation of their military operations in international waters after Trump won the 2024 US presidential election.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. Evidence from the Atlantic Council ([https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-should-not-forget-the-russian-hand-behind-the-houthis/)) and ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/yemens-houthi-rebels-attack-ship-red-sea-killing-123559774)) indicates that military operations continued after Trump's election, with the US conducting airstrikes and the Houthis launching attacks in 2025.

So, the overall veracity is: false
