The claim '<image:26> This image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31st, 2024. This is how a precision strike looks like: a single missile through the window, and only Haniyeh and his bodyguard are dead. Nobody else in the building is even injured.' is false.
Justification: The claim that the image depicts the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, is not supported by the evidence. While multiple sources confirm Haniyeh's assassination on that date ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)), the provided image's location and relation to the event are not confirmed. The evidence does not provide details about the nature of the attack.

So, the overall veracity is: false
