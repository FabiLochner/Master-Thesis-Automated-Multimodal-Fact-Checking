## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-200700554.html)) both report that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson, which includes the text "soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way" and an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass, is fake. Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.

The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mel-gibson-dropped-from-new-orleans-mardi-gras-amid-outcry-from-jewish-groups/)) mentions Gibson's history of antisemitic remarks. ![image 47](media/76.jpg), ![image 8931](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513099-753393.jpg), ![image 8935](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513108-707753.jpg), ![image 8944](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513116-435603.jpg)


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results show images of an hourglass with the colors of the Israeli flag. One image shows a flag in the colors of Israel with an hourglass in the middle (![image 8947](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513129-262445.jpg)), another shows an hourglass with the colors of the Israeli flag (![image 8948](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513129-565583.jpg)), and a third shows an hourglass in front of an Israeli flag (![image 8950](media/2025-08-30_00-18-1756513130-201069.jpg)).

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-200700554.html)), confirm the post's inauthenticity. Furthermore, Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.


## Final Judgement
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. The post's content and the image of the altered Israeli flag are misrepresented.

`false`
