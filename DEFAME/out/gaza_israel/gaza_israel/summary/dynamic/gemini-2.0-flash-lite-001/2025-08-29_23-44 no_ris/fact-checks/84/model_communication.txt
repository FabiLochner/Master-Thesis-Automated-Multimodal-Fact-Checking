JERUSALEM — Israel's government said a drone targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s house Saturday, with no casualties, as fighting with Lebanon-based Hezbollah and Gaza-based Hamas showed no pause after the [killing of the Hamas mastermind](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

**Drone targets Netanyahu’s house while Israeli strikes in Gaza kill more than 50** **Israel said a drone targeted the prime minister’s house; there were no casualties. Netanyahu’s office said the drone targeted his house in the Mediterranean coastal town of Caesarea. It wasn't clear if the house was hit.

“The proxies of Iran who today tried to assassinate me and my wife made a bitter mistake,” Netanyahu said.

Hezbollah didn't claim responsibility but said it carried out several rocket attacks on Israel. Group of Seven defense ministers warned against escalation and “all-out war.”  

### New exchange of airstrikes

Israel’s military said about 200 projectiles were fired from Lebanon, a day after Hezbollah said it planned to send more guided missiles and exploding drones. Netanyahu says Israel's military will fight until the hostages are released, and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from regrouping.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who don't distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday, and Palestinian communications company Paltel said they knocked out internet networks in the north.

This image shows damage to the exterior of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, on October 22, 2024.

From Social Media

CNN  — 

The beachside home of Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu was damaged in a drone strike claimed by Hezbollah, video footage geolocated by CNN shows, in an attack that penetrated deep inside Israel even as the militant group reels from sustained Israeli bombardment.

Netanyahu and his wife were not at home at the time of Saturday’s attack in the coastal city of Caesarea and no-one was injured, according to Israeli officials.

But the incident has raised questions about how the drone evaded Israel’s air defenses even after Hezbollah’s leadership has been decimated and as Israel’s military ramps up strikes across swathes of Lebanon.

CNN affiliate Kan 11 published an exterior photo of the house showing damage to a window with cracks and what appears to be burn marks. The IDF said two drones were fired and that while one was intercepted, the other was not – due to what it said was a human error.

The attack on Netanyahu’s house comes at a time of a widening regional conflagration in the Middle East. Israel still has not carried out its expected response to Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month and is continuing its military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon.

The incident also comes as the US is investigating a leak of highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran following an October 1 Iranian missile barrage targeting Israel.

A [deadly attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/middleeast/hezbollah-attack-israel-weaknesses-drones-intl-cmd/index.html)
 by Hezbollah earlier in October killed four soldiers in a military base some 40 miles into Israel from the border.

In July, a drone launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen killed one man and injured at least 10 others in Tel Aviv. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Caesarea.”

The Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson confirmed the attack that day, but it was not until Tuesday that Israeli authorities admitted the drone had hit the house.

Hezbollah claimed “full and exclusive responsibility” on Tuesday for the attack, and issued a warning: “If we haven’t reached you yet, know that between us and you are the days, the nights, and the battlefield.”

In a post on X following the attack on Saturday, Netanyahu blamed “agents of Iran” for the strike, and said they “made a bitter mistake.”

“I say to the Iranians and their partners in the axis of evil: Anyone who harms the citizens of the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,” Netanyahu added.

Iran denied involvement in the drone attack, stating the operation was “carried out by Hezbollah.”

Drones have proved something of a low-tech but deadly menace to Israel.

The country’s air defense systems are impressive, intercepting and destroying most projectiles fired towards the country. Kan 11 reported that the damaged window was that of a bedroom.

“Allowed for publication: the UAV that Hezbollah launched and hit the Prime Minister’s house in Caesarea,” the caption of the photo shared by the reporter reads.

Video geolocated by CNN shows the same scene of the exterior window in what seems to be the backyard of the house.

The Israeli military on Saturday said “three UAVs were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory."

Netanyahu’s house hit by drone as Israel and Hezbollah trade blows in Lebanon
=============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Shia group has not claimed responsibility for attack on PM’s home but says it fired several barrages of rockets

Benjamin Netanyahu’s house in the seaside town of Caesarea was hit by a drone on Saturday, causing superficial damage and no casualties, as Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon rage unabated after the death [of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/hamas-recognises-death-of-leader-yahya-sinwar-but-vows-to-keep-fighting)
.

The Israeli government said that one of the prime minister’s three homes was targeted by three drones, two of which were intercepted, and that neither Netanyahu nor his wife, Sara, were home at the time.

In a statement on Saturday night, [Benjamin Netanyahu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu)
 said: “The attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.”

Netanyahu vowed that Iran and its proxies would “pay a heavy price” and said Israel would continue to “eliminate the terrorists and those who dispatch them”.

Israeli media later published a video of the prime minister walking in a park.

Israel’s air raid system was not triggered by the lightweight drones, which are difficult to detect. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

On Saturday an Israeli drone strike killed two people driving on the highway in Jounieh, a Christian-majority city north of Beirut, marking the first time the city has been hit. The attack was the latest in a series of assassinations in northern Lebanon over the last month in areas that have otherwise not seen any Israeli strikes.

Eyewitness accounts said the drone fired at a car three times before a man and a woman fled the car on foot, where they were struck down in a field next to the highway."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence suggests that the image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Furthermore, multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone. While the CNN article mentions Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, it does not specify that they took the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:53>)
web_search("Benjamin Netanyahu house drone image")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Israel': 0.17, 'Mexico': 0.15, 'Tunisia': 0.11, 'Malta': 0.1, 'Palestine': 0.07, 'Bermuda': 0.05, 'Jordan': 0.05, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.04, 'Dominican Republic': 0.03, 'Pakistan': 0.03}

### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea, Israel, was targeted by a drone. An NPR article from October 19, 2024, states that the drone targeted his house, while a CNN article from October 23, 2024, claims that Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack and that the house was damaged. The Guardian also reported on October 19, 2024, that Netanyahu's house was hit by a drone, causing superficial damage.

The articles mention the attack occurred in October 2024. The CNN article includes an image showing damage to the exterior of the house. <image:k> The NPR article includes an image showing smoke rising from an Israeli airstrike. <image:4619> The Guardian article includes an image of the house. <image:4623>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image could be of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as the geolocation data indicates a probability of the image being taken in Israel. Furthermore, multiple news sources confirm that Netanyahu's house was targeted by a drone in October 2024. However, the claim states the image was taken in August 2024, which contradicts the timeframe reported by the news articles.

The evidence does not explicitly confirm that the image was taken by a Hezbollah drone. While the CNN article mentions Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack, it does not specify that they took the image.

Therefore, the claim is likely false because the image was taken in October 2024, not August 2024.

Content: "The false posts emerged after the news channel broadcast footage that appeared to show Israeli soldiers sexually abusing Palestinian prisoners at a military base.** 

“Israel’s Channel 12 asked a question in an Israeli public opinion poll: Do you agree with the claim that a soldier is allowed to rape a prisoner with his hands tied? <image:8979>

Screenshot of the false post, taken August 22, 2024

The posts emerged online after the United States [urged](https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
 Israel to investigate and implement accountability following the circulation of a video that appeared to show soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner on August 7 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070528/https://www.barrons.com/news/us-urges-israel-to-probe-video-of-prison-sex-abuse-6316ea67)
).

The leaked surveillance video, broadcast on Channel 12, showed Israel soldiers hiding behind shields in what online commentators suggested was sexual acts performed on a prisoner the Sde Teiman base.

The Israeli military said it has opened an [investigation](https://www.barrons.com/news/israel-army-opens-probe-into-suspected-abuse-of-detainee-cf341d85)
 into “suspected abuse” of a detainee at the facility, known to be holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza during the war ([archived link](https://perma.cc/JAJ6-FJ6U)
).

Channel 12 hosted a [controversial debate](https://www.the7eye.org.il/526413)
 on August 7 in which panellists discussed whether the rape and abuse of Palestinian prisoners should be legalised ([archived link](https://perma.cc/A49R-S47W)
).

The war was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,205 people, mostly civilians, according to an [AFP tally](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
 based on Israeli official figures ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240904021154/https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240903-israel-pm-unbowed-by-pressure-as-gaza-war-rages-on)
).

Israel’s retaliatory military campaign to destroy Hamas has killed 40,819 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The altered image was shared on Facebook by users based in [Malaysia](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822013834/https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzinnirahmuthalif%2Fposts%2Fpfbid023SwxWmk3NXhVA2xDdnruaXAqhSAH7y6FNtfppVPESkD7YZbhuyLyJ2n5nEcHWexNl&show_text=true&width=500)

**Altered screenshot**

A reverse image search on Google found the [original footage](https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
 of the news bulletin segment published by Channel 12 on its website on May 27, 2022 ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240822070753/https://www.mako.co.il/news-channel12?subChannelId=b91e54300a2ef710VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD&vcmid=622e1dba8a601810VgnVCM200000650a10acRCRD)
).

The two-minute, six-second video shows an anchor presenting the news alongside the survey results that read in Hebrew: “Do you agree with the claim that the government relies on supporters of terrorism?”

The video’s Hebrew-language title translates to English as: “A year for the government: a survey of mandates”.

The timestamp for the clip screenshot used in the misleading post can be seen at the one-minute 46-second mark.

In the manipulated image, a blue box covered the screen, hiding the original question that was displayed with the results on a screen behind the news anchor.

Channel 12 subsequently apologised for the poll, Israeli newspaper Haaretz [reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-02/ty-article/.premium/leading-israeli-news-channel-apologizes-for-terror-supporters-poll/0000018a-f13e-dfa2-a99e-f97fd6ea0000)

Content: "It confirms what we saw last week when Israeli journalist Yehuda Shlezinger lamented on Israel’s mainstream Channel 12 [how gang rape is not an approved and regulated policy](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 in Israeli detention centers. 

That figure, 65%, also echoes the February [poll](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/02/over-2-3-of-jewish-israelis-oppose-humanitarian-aid-to-palestinians-starving-in-gaza/)
 saying that 68% of Jewish Israelis  “oppose the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents at this time,” even if Hamas or UNRWA were out of the picture in terms of distribution. 

The same INSS poll citing the 65% opposing criminal prosecution of the gang rapists incidentally cites an identical percentage of Israeli Jews as having “high trust” in the reports of the military spokesperson “throughout the war in Gaza” — an institution which generates incessant [genocide propaganda](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/the-real-reason-israel-stormed-al-shifa-hospital-yet-again/)
. [Opinion](https://mondoweiss.net/opinion/)

65% of Israeli Jews oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of raping Palestinian detainees
======================================================================================================

A shocking new poll shows that almost two out of three Jewish Israelis oppose criminal prosecution for soldiers suspected of gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility.

A shocking [poll](https://www.inss.org.il/he/publication/august-2024/)
 published on August 18 by the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies surveys attitudes concerning various aspects of what Israel calls “Swords of Iron” — the genocide of the last ten months and counting. 

The poll asks, among else, how people would want to handle the soldiers suspected of [gang-raping Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman torture facility](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/08/israeli-medias-coverage-of-the-rape-of-palestinian-detainees-shows-support-for-sexual-violence-in-service-of-genocide/)
 if it turned out that the suspicions were strong. Two-thirds of Jewish Israelis are saying that there is simply nothing criminal here — only “bad behavior,” at worst. 

And this seems to strengthen the pattern that has been documented: not only do Israelis seem to generally enjoy watching [snuff videos](https://mondoweiss.net/2024/03/we-are-the-masters-of-the-house-israeli-channels-air-snuff-videos-featuring-systematic-torture-of-palestinians/)
 of this systemic torture — they generally support the sexual violence, including rape, that has accompanied it. There, they only offer a data tracker on six points, but it doesn’t include the Hebrew survey with its 23 points. 

So this is yet another unbelievable data point — gang rape as a weapon of war is not considered criminal by two out of three Jewish Israelis when it’s Israeli soldiers doing it to Palestinians (in the much-publicized gang rape case, the victim happens to be a civil servant, a policeman for the drug control department in Jabalia). 

When it comes to Palestinians, the blanket suspicion of affiliation with Hamas generates a rationale for revenge by which Palestinians are assumed to be involved with sexual violence, and when we speak about “disciplinary measures” here, it is not just systemic torture and sexual violence, it also reaches the level of murder through torture. In addition to wishing a “regulated policy” of rape existed in Israeli prisons, Shlezinger also advocated that the “terrorists” be “executed according to law.” And he shared that belief during his _apology_ for his rape advocacy.

It is a whole other world of impunity for Israeli soldiers. 65%, almost two out of three Jewish Israelis, opposed criminal prosecution, and would prefer them be “handled in a disciplinary manner, by the commanding level only.”

The survey asked the question:

> “Recently, the military prosecution requested to extend the arrest of the five soldiers suspected of gross abuse, and clarified that there is added evidence which strengthens the suspicion against them. The story has been updated._

The screenshots show the image originally shared by Erakat said 47% of respondents answered "yes" to a poll asking "do you agree that a soldier is allowed to rape a Palestinian?"

WASHINGTON (TND) — Rep. Erakat's now-deleted X post contained a doctored image of a poll seemingly conducted by Israel's Channel 12, according to [screenshots](https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313 "https://x.com/yashar/status/1821337704711516313")
 shared by users. "THAT is the disgrace, Alex."  

When reached for comment, Erakat reiterated to TND that it is "not a leap or a stretch" to believe such a poll would have been published by Channel 12. She noted the image circulated shortly after video was released of an alleged gang rape of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli soldiers at detention facilitySde Teiman.

State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday called for an investigation related to the video, emphasizing claims of sexual abuse atSde Teiman are "horrific." Israel's Supreme Court has repeatedly convened to consider closingthe facility.

Erakat told TND it is "devastating" for Palestinian-Americans to see such footage, adding both a lack of media coverage and the outrage she and Rep. <image:8989>](https://cbsaustin.com/game-center#/games/guessword)

![FILE - Rep. Tlaib drew backlash for sharing the post, including from Forward columnist Alex Zeldin, who [called](https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919 "https://x.com/JewishWonk/status/1821335110844575919")
 the congresswoman "a disgrace."

"Why is Rashida Tlaib, a Member of Congress, openly distributing fake polls claiming an American ally is pro-rape?" Zeldin wrote on X. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., also [condemned](https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962 "https://x.com/RitchieTorres/status/1821941043035594962")
 the doctored image, calling "disinformation" a "new enemy of Israel on the social media age."

> A fake poll falsely accusing Israelis of endorsing rape against Palestinians is dangerous disinformation designed to delegitimize and demonize both the Jewish People and the Jewish State," the congressman said. Tlaib trusted me & posting this \[without\] cross checking was my mistake."  

"But surely u understand how one would take this poll to be true in light of video of gang rape of a Palestinian detainee & Knesset + public debate on whether such rape should be ok," she added. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is drawing backlash for sharing a social media post which falsely claimed most Israeli citizens believe soldiers can sexually assault Palestinians.

Noura Erakat, a prominent Palestinian-American activist and Rutgers University professor, initially made the post Wednesday."

West Coast carrier USS _Abraham Lincoln_ (CVN-72) is setting sail to the Middle East from the Pacific to relieve the carrier USS _Theodore Roosevelt_ (CVN-71) and its strike group. guided-missile destroyers that intercepted cruise and ballistic missiles in the first combat use of the Standard Missile 3.

As of Monday, _Lincoln_ was operating in the vicinity of Hawaii following [its July 11 deployment](https://news.usni.org/2024/07/12/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-leaves-on-deployment-uss-theodore-roosevelt-now-in-the-middle-east)

.

It’s unclear on the timing of the transition between the two strike groups. Eisenhower_ (CVN-69) and its escorts from being extended a third time, [USNI News first reported](https://news.usni.org/2024/06/21/uss-dwight-d-eisenhower-leaving-red-sea-pacific-carrier-heading-to-the-middle-east)
. The next East Coast carrier set to head to the region, USS _Harry S. Truman_ (CVN-75), is still off the East Coast and in the midst of its pre-deployment training, USNI News understands.

In addition, the three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group with the embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ARG, composed of USS _Wasp_ (LHD-1), USS _New York_ (LPD-21) and USS _Oak Hill_ (LSD-51), and the 24th MEU are in position in the event of a non-combatant evacuation of people from Lebanon, several defense officials have told USNI News.

The Pentagon also announced the deployment of unspecified fighter squadrons headed to the region.

“The Secretary of Defense has reiterated that the United States will protect our personnel and interests in the region, including our ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,” reads the statement from the Pentagon.

The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the Middle East in August 2024, but it does not explicitly state that they were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Therefore, the claim is partially supported but lacks specific details about the warships' destination and mission.

USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

Austin said in a statement on Friday that while the U.S. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said Saturday that Tehran's retaliation will be "severe and (taken) at an appropriate time, place, and manner," Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-hamas-leader-haniyeh-was-killed-by-short-range-projectile-2024-08-03/)
.

On Thursday night, President Biden reaffirmed his commitment to support Israel in a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. is taking additional measures to support Israel, its priority is to prevent a wider war in the Middle East.

"The United States also remains intently focused on de-escalating tensions in the region and pushing for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal to bring the hostages home and end the war in Gaza," Austin said.

Israel had previously pledged to kill Hamas leaders in response to the group's Oct. It remains to be seen how the recent assassinations will affect ongoing cease-fire negations and the hostage releases.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.


## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:55>)
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Singapore': 0.32, 'Malta': 0.15, 'France': 0.1, 'South Korea': 0.07, 'Malaysia': 0.06, 'Taiwan': 0.04, 'Monaco': 0.03, 'Croatia': 0.02, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Bermuda': 0.01}

## Elaboration
The geolocation results do not provide any information about the location of the image in relation to Lebanon or Israel. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the new evidence.

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.

On a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, the White House said President Joe Biden “reaffirmed his commitment to Israel’s security against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.”

Kirby said Friday that that support would likely come in the form of both personnel and hardware in the region.

The Turkish flag is seen at half-staff at the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, on August 2.

CNN

A decision by the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv to fly its flag half-staff as part of Turkey’s national day of mourning for [Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/middleeast/ismail-haniyeh-death-hamas-profile-intl-hnk/index.html)
 has left members of the Israeli government and public enraged. 

Foreign Minister Israel Katz summoned Turkey’s deputy ambassador for a “stern reprimand” after the move, saying Israel “will not accept expressions of sympathy for a murderer like Ismail Haniyeh.“

The Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir called for the expulsion of the ambassador, saying Turkey’s lowering of the flag as a “tribute” to Haniyeh “shows exactly what they think of us.” 

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday will be a national day of mourning for Haniyeh, who was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran this week. He was [assassinated](http://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/middleeast/hamas-political-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed-intl-hnk)

The [US decision to send warships and fighter squadron to the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 will mark perhaps the largest movement of US forces to the region since the early days of the Gaza war, when the Pentagon sent two carrier strike groups toward the Middle East in a very public warning to regional militant groups not to expand the fighting.

The region is bracing for an Iranian retaliation after the country’s supreme leader vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this week. Officials said the attack may be similar to the barrage of ballistic missiles and drones [Iran launched against Israel in April,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/middleeast/iran-drones-attack-israel-intl-latam/index.html)
 but it could also be larger and more complex, coordinated with Iranian proxies in the region. 

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hinted that a coordinated attack on Israel could be in the works after Israel assassinated one of the Iran-backed group’s top commanders in Beirut less than 24 hours before the killing of Haniyeh. 

“Because they have picked a fight with everyone, they don’t know where the response will come from … the response will come separately or coordinated,” he said in a speech Thursday.

USS Abraham Lincoln sails the Pacific Ocean on August 2.

Jerome D. Johnson Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class/US Navy

The [United States is sending](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/politics/us-warships-middle-east-brace-iranian-retaliation/index.html)
 a carrier strike group, a fighter squadron and additional warships to the Middle East as the region braces for possible Iranian retaliation to the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran earlier this week.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group, which is currently operating in the Gulf of Oman, according to a statement from deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh.

Destroyers and cruisers capable of ballistic missile defense will also be sent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea. The statement does not say which warships have been sent, but two US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea took part in intercepting the barrage of strikes Iran launched against Israel in April.

Austin also ordered the deployment of a fighter squadron to the region, Singh said.

The US already has the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship in the region, which operates with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, capable of carrying out an evacuation of US citizens in Lebanon should it be ordered.

Iran has vowed to attack Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has not commented on the killing.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will direct “multiple force posture moves” in the Middle East ahead of a possible attack by Iran on Israel, according to the Pentagon.

Austin spoke to Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Friday and “informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and future defense force posture changes that the department will take to support the defense of Israel,” deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.

Singh declined to detail the potential moves, saying that Austin would be directing those moves “at a later time.” But the US has a number of naval assets already in the region, including a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman and amphibious assault ships and destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.

A US official separately told CNN that the additional capabilities would likely include more air defense systems to help protect Israel and US forces from a potential Iranian attack. 

Singh noted that there “could be additional” US troops that enter the region to help bolster US forces there but declined to outline specific capabilities or units that may be deployed. 

CNN reported on Thursday the Pentagon discussed with US Central Command what adjustments to make to US force posture in the region. In July, the UN warned of widespread famine across [the strip](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html)
, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians. 

Raghad Ezzat Hamouda, a Palestinian displaced in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, told CNN that the past nine months have been engulfed by “fear and terror.” 

“This situation has become very dangerous, as hundreds of children die every day,” the 19-year-old said on Friday."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR reported on August 3, 2024, that the U.S. is sending more warships to the Middle East as Israel steps up attacks, with Israel expecting an attack from Iran and its allies ([https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/03/nx-s1-5061738/the-u-s-is-sending-more-warships-to-the-middle-east-as-israel-steps-up-attacks)). USNI News reported on August 2, 2024, that the USS Abraham Lincoln is heading to the Middle East in response to threats from Iran, and a three-ship Wasp Amphibious Ready Group is in the Eastern Mediterranean ([https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel](https://news.usni.org/2024/08/02/carrier-uss-abraham-lincoln-heads-to-middle-east-as-iran-threatens-strikes-against-israel)).

Military.com reported on September 20, 2024, about the increased U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including warships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea ([https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/09/20/us-warplanes-ships-and-troops-ready-middle-east-if-conflict-expands.html)). <image:8996>, <image:8999>, <image:9009>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The web search results discuss U.S. warships en route to Lebanon. One article from L'Orient-Le Jour discusses this topic ([https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html](https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1422223/which-american-warships-are-en-route-to-lebanon.html)) and another from the Associated Press ([https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09](https://apnews.com/article/navy-warships-lebanon-hezbollah-israel-feec28090bed129618eda05e25a59b09)).

Stratfor also has an article on the topic ([https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/lebanon-what-us-warships-coast-do-and-do-not-mean)). The search results include images of warships (<image:9017>, <image:9018>, <image:9019>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that U.S. warships were deployed to the Middle East, including the Eastern Mediterranean, in August 2024. The evidence also mentions that the U.S. military presence was increased in the region due to threats from Iran and its allies. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast to support the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

Therefore, the claim is partially supported by the evidence, as it confirms the presence of U.S. warships in the region during the specified timeframe. However, the specific purpose of the deployment, as stated in the claim, is not directly supported by the provided evidence.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm the warships' destination and their specific mission in relation to the IDF.
