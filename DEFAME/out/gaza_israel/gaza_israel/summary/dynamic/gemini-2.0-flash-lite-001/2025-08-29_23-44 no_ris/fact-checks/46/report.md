## Elaboration
1.  The evidence indicates that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects.
2.  The Dublin Live article from November 2024 shows that Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour in November 2024 to aid the Israeli army.

**Insufficient information**: The claim cannot be verified because the search results do not mention a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Bob Geldof and Bono (U2's lead singer) have collaborated on projects, and that in November 2024, Mary Coughlan criticized Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza. However, there is no evidence of a multi-stadium tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.
