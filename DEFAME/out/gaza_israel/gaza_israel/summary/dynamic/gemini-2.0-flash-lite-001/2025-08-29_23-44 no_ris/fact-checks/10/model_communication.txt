BEIRUT — Israel's military announced Sunday it is now taking aim at the Lebanon-based Hezbollah's financial arm and will attack a “large number of targets” in Beirut and elsewhere. Explosions began in Beirut's southern suburbs about an hour later.

Evacuation warnings affected southern Beirut, the eastern Bekaa valley and parts of southern Lebanon. AP video showed strikes near Lebanon’s only airport but it continued to operate.

The strikes will target al-Qard al-Hassan "all over Lebanon,” a senior Israeli intelligence official said. <image:3582>](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/18/nx-s1-5157608/israel-hamas-sinwar-gaza-future)

“AQAH is a cash-based organization. A stream of people left the areas surrounding its branches in Beirut.

In one evacuation notice, for the Choueifat area south of Beirut, the Israeli military mislabeled one target, causing confusion and panic. The location was labeled as Grand Cinema ABC Verdun, a theater in an upscale shopping mall in central Beirut more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.

A year of escalating tensions and frequent cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the war in Gaza turned into all-out war last month. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called civilian casualties in Lebanon “far too high” in the Israel-Hezbollah war, and urged Israel to scale back some strikes, especially in and around Beirut."

Massive blasts in Beirut after renewed Israeli air strikes

Moment giant explosions seen near Beirut airport

Israeli bombing caused large explosions in Beirut, including one close to the international airport during a further night of air strikes targeting Hezbollah.

The airport borders Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold in the capital. <image:3584>!Map showing southern Lebanese towns and villages affected by Israeli military evacuation orders (3 October 2024) <image:3585>

The news came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told residents of another two dozen towns and villages in the south, including the regional capital of Nabatieh, to leave immediately for their own safety.

Unlike the communities ordered to evacuate on Tuesday, they are all located north of the Litani river, which lies about 30km (18 miles) from the border.

Before the invasion, Israel had demanded that Hezbollah’s withdraw to the Litani, in accordance with a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.

Speaking to the BBC from Beirut, the World Food Programme's country director in Lebanon, Matthew Hollingworth, described the situation there as “horrific”.

“There is black smoke billowing over the southern suburbs and we see it each morning when we come to work and we see it all day long. There's traffic everywhere, people sleeping outside.”

Juan Gabriel Wells, Lebanon country director with the International Rescue Committee, said nearly half of displaced people surveyed by his organisation in shelters run by the government were children under the age of 15.

'It's still a scene of chaos' - BBC reporter outside Beirut building hit by Israeli strike

Israel's latest air strikes on Beirut come 24 hours after a residential building in the centre of the capital was hit. <image:3584>!Dean Sweetland, who lives in a kibbutz on Israel's northern border with Lebanon <image:3587>

Dean Sweetland said his house near Israel's northern border shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon

Dean Sweetland, a former British soldier who moved to Israel eight years ago, is one of the few people still living in a near-empty kibbutz within sight of the Lebanese town of Bint Jbeil.

He told the BBC that his house shook several times a day with rocket and anti-tank missiles fired from Lebanon, some of them intercepted by Israel’s air-defences overhead.

“We can’t continue this for another year, having Hezbollah sitting on our border just waiting to do an October 7th on us,” he said, referring to Hamas’s deadly attack on southern Israel last year that triggered the Gaza war.

“But my son is in the army, and do we want our kids to be in there, slaughtered, where Hezbollah has been waiting for us to go in for nearly 20 years?”

“It’s not going to be pretty,” he continued, “but if that’s what it takes, then that’s what it takes.”

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Israel launched airstrikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)) and the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o)). However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image provided in the claim.

The image search results show that similar events have occurred in the past, such as in 2006, but do not provide any information about the image's authenticity.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if the image is indeed from the October 2024 events. This would require additional information, such as the source of the image and confirmation from a reliable source.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)) reported on October 20, 2024, that Israel launched airstrikes on Beirut, targeting Hezbollah's financial arm, with strikes near the airport. <image:3581> The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o)) reported on October 4, 2024, on Israeli air strikes in Beirut, including near the international airport. <image:3584>, <image:3585>

Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, mentioning Israeli strikes in Beirut, including airstrikes and the closure of Beirut's airport. <image:10>


### Evidence from `image_search`
ABC News published an article on July 14, 2006, about Israel bombing Beirut airport (<image:748>). Al Jazeera also reported on Israel bombing Beirut airport (<image:750>).

The provided sources do not mention an event in October 2024.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Israel launched airstrikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)) and the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o)). However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image provided in the claim.

The image search results show that similar events have occurred in the past, such as in 2006, but do not provide any information about the image's authenticity.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if the image is indeed from the October 2024 events. This would require additional information, such as the source of the image and confirmation from a reliable source.

2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

The evidence confirms that Israel launched airstrikes near Beirut's airport in October 2024, as reported by NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/nx-s1-5159029/israel-airstrikes-beirut-hezbollahs-financial-lebanon)) and the BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17lpydd842o)). However, the evidence does not explicitly confirm the authenticity of the image provided in the claim.

The image search results show that similar events have occurred in the past, such as in 2006, but do not provide any information about the image's authenticity.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to determine if the image is indeed from the October 2024 events. This would require additional information, such as the source of the image and confirmation from a reliable source.

Montreal electronic traffic signs altered to display pro-Palestinian slogans

The message boards, which normally advise motorists of roadwork, were tampered with to display phrases such as "free Palestine," "escalate now," and "globalize the intifada." By the end of Wednesday morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Some in Montreal’s Jewish community are looking for answers after electronic traffic signs at two different construction sites in the city displayed the political slogans “free Palestine” and “escalate now” in an apparent hack. (HO-Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs/The Canadian Press)

Montreal police are investigating after electronic message boards at two road construction sites in the city displayed pro-Palestinian political slogans Wednesday morning instead of usual traffic alerts.

The message boards, which normally advise motorists of roadwork, were tampered with to display phrases such as "free Palestine," "escalate now," and "globalize the intifada." By the end of the morning, the original messages had been restored at the sites.

Intifada, which means "shaking off" in Arabic, was coined to describe an uprising against Israel's military occupation that erupted in 1987. She said "hijacking" signs that are meant to provide safety information to drivers with any kind of political message "raises huge alarm bells as to what these people are willing to do."

The City of Montreal called the incident an act of vandalism. He said that soon after it was noticed, the original messages were restored.

A group called Clash Mtl has claimed responsibility, writing on Instagram that it carried out the act during the night with the goal of showing "solidarity with Palestine." The group did not respond to a request for comment.

A Montreal police spokesperson said by email that they are aware of the situation and are investigating. The city administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Not a call for violence
-----------------------

Niall Clapham Ricardo with Independent Jewish Voices disputed that the messages are a call for violence, saying the slogans refer to a desire to end the violence and dispossession of Palestinians in the occupied territories as Israeli strikes continue to claim thousands of lives in Gaza.

Clapham Ricardo says part of the problem is that many wrongfully associate all Palestinian resistance with suicide bombing.

"We have to get out of this binary of freeing Palestine means violence against Jews. What became known as the first intifada was marked by widespread Palestinian protests and a fierce Israeli response.

In the second uprising, which began in 2000, Palestinian militants carried out deadly suicide bombings on buses and at restaurants and hotels, eliciting crushing Israeli military reprisals.

Eta Yudin, Quebec vice-president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, called the messages on the traffic signs an incitement to violence against Jews because she said "intifada" refers to terror attacks.

Her organization wants police to investigate what happened and measures to be put in place so it does not happen again. It said the signs in question belong to a private contractor hired by the city and are the responsibility of the contractor.

City spokesperson Gonzalo Nunez said in an email that padlocks on the signs were broken, allowing someone to program the unauthorized messages. There's always going to be more war," he said.

McGill University political science professor Rex Brynen also says the Arabic word "intifada" does not inherently imply violence or non-violence and should therefore be understood as more of a rallying cry for protest.

Graphic assembled by The Maple staff.

The City of Montreal is facing legal action after its employees were caught on camera tearing down pro-Palestine signs ahead of a federal by-election.

The signs belonged to LaSalle-Émard-Verdun pour la Palestine (LEV4P), which is legally [registered](https://www.elections.ca/WPAPPS/WPR/EN/TP?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a third-party campaign group in the upcoming LaSalle—Émard—Verdun by-election, taking place on September 16.

The incident is the third time since 2008 that the City of Montreal inappropriately removed election signs belonging to Palestine solidarity groups and pro-Palestine political parties, raising questions about why such signs are being targeted.

LEV4P sent a cease and desist letter to the City on August 2. He pointed out that the City was [ordered](https://thecjn.ca/news/bds-group-awarded-damages-for-election-poster-removal/?ref=readthemaple.com)
 to pay $12,860 in punitive damages in 2018 for a similar incident involving pro-Palestine signs displayed by registered groups back in 2015.

“There’s no more good faith argument when it’s the third time, and when you’ve had a judge severely criticize you for this,” said Johnson.

LEV4P raised and spent approximately $3,000 on the signs, and those torn down by City workers on camera represented only a fraction of those that were distributed throughout the riding — before they were taken down. 

The signs highlighted Canada’s complicity in Israel’s war on Gaza, which is being [examined](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192?ref=readthemaple.com)
 as a case of genocide at the International Court of Justice, as well as more generic slogans calling for a free Palestine.

After the City admitted removing some of the signs, it returned 95 signs out of a total of 450. Johnson said that his clients could not simply replace the signs before getting them back from the City since they would be in danger of exceeding third-party spending limits.

In his view, this means the damage has already been done to the democratic process.

“This new violation which the City of Montreal has committed is so serious, and the effect that it can have is a sort of chilling effect,” Johnson explained. 

“That’s the danger when public authorities intervene to limit freedom of speech: It can undermine people’s confidence in our democracy. “We know that the silencing of voices in favour of the national liberation of Palestine and silencing of voices denouncing the genocide in Gaza is something that’s going on across the board.”

He noted that Jeremy Levi, the mayor of the Montreal suburb of Hampstead and a [vocal](https://x.com/jerlevi/status/1820976230205698248?ref=readthemaple.com)
 [supporter](https://x.com/jerlevi/status/1823161068304429422?ref=readthemaple.com)
 of Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza, [tweeted](https://x.com/jerlevi/status/1817660532020658613?ref=readthemaple.com)
 on July 28 that the election signs were “hate propaganda,” and called on Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante to “take a stand and restore order in our city.”

When challenged by LEV4P during a City council meeting about the removal of the signs, Mayor Plante stressed that the previous case took place nearly a decade ago. “To me, it is motivated by the message on our signs.”

Canada’s role in Israel’s war on Gaza has proven to be a potent issue in the upcoming by-election, which was triggered following the resignation of Liberal MP and justice minister David Lametti in January.

Last week, CBC News [reported](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-staffers-gaza-montreal-byelection-1.7306984?ref=readthemaple.com)
 that 52 Arab and Muslim staffers in the Liberal government signed a letter saying they would not participate in the by-election campaign due to Justin Trudeau’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.

“We can no longer in good conscience campaign for a party that excludes us and our values,” CBC quoted the letter as reading.

The staffers’ demands included “explicitly condemning Israel for its numerous war crimes and for the genocidal rhetoric from members of the Israeli Cabinet,” recognizing the State of Palestine, and revoking all existing permits for arms exports to Israel, including those that are [shipped](https://www.readthemaple.com/u-s-names-quebec-contractor-in-newly-approved-arms-sale-to-israel/)

### **Repeated Incidents**

The first time the City [removed](https://canadiandimension.com/blog/view/westmount-on-warpath-against-communist-candidates-election-posters?ref=readthemaple.com)
 pro-Palestine election signs was in 2008, when municipal authorities removed signs belonging to the Communist Party of Canada candidate Bill Sloan in the Westmount neighbourhood.

Following that incident, municipal authorities signed an agreement with Elections Canada to not allow such an infringement to occur again, according to Johnson. 

The second incident occurred in 2015, when the Communist Party and a third-party group promoting Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel put up signs denouncing Israel’s human rights violations and occupation of Palestine.

As with the incident in this year’s by-election, in 2015 the City claimed the removals were good faith errors made due to the disturbing imagery on some of the signs, which depicted the body of a Palestinian boy killed by the Israeli military in Gaza.

The two groups took the City to court, which ruled that the City had intentionally violated the fundamental rights of the citizens who displayed the signs, according to Johnson. To his knowledge, none of the coalition’s signs were removed by the City of Montreal.

“Our clients are very justified in having some very serious questions about the motivation of the city in taking down these posters,” said Johnson. “I don’t think that is a defence that will hold up in court.”

In an emailed statement sent in French and translated into English by The Maple using an online tool, the City of Montreal said it would not comment on the matter due to the possibility of legal action.

“The City confirms having received a copy of the formal notice from the Lasalle-Émard-Verdun organization for Palestine,” the City said."

Spigel Sohmer senior partner Neil Oberman has served Mayor Valérie Plante by bailiff regarding electronic signs normally used in construction areas that were used by pro-Palestinian activists to convey anti-Israel hate messages.

Oberman, who is also the Conservative candidate for Mount Royal, is acting on behalf of Hampstead Mayor Jeremy Levi, who, amongst others, called attention to the road construction signs, which say "Free Palestine. Valérie Plante needs to take concrete action."

Police are investigating the incident, credit for which was claimed by a group called Clash MTL. The hate propaganda is a by-product of your inaction."

Oberman wrote that his client, Levi, "contends that your negligence has enabled the spread of hate and violence on the island of Montreal, which is targeted against the citizens of Montreal."

The letter demands that Plante:

• Launch a "full investigation into the hate propaganda and that the same be made public."

• "Issue a letter of apology to the residents of Hampstead."

• Reveal "what measures \[will be taken\] so that hate is not supported nor tolerated by the City of Montreal and/or the use of its assets to do the same."

• "Confirm that the City of Montreal will investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the hate propaganda without delay." Otherwise, "our client will take the appropriate steps in law to safeguard the interests of his residents."

Montreal mayor, police chief defend officers after weekend anti-NATO protest vandalism
======================================================================================

Monday afternoon, Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante denounced violence at an anti-NATO demonstration that took place Friday evening. (Radio-Canada)

Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante condemned the actions of protesters and defended police after chaos broke out at a demonstration Friday evening against the NATO Parliamentary Assembly taking place in the city.

Plante held a news conference Monday afternoon, saying Montreal police officers have attended nearly 500 protests since the war in Gaza began last fall.

"The images from Friday are shocking: people breaking windows, torching vehicles," Plante said. All three were released and will appear in court at a later date.

At least 3 arrested after anti-NATO, pro-Palestinian protests in Montreal

9 months ago

Montreal police say at least three people were arrested after anti-NATO and pro-Palestinian demonstrators converged in the city's downtown core, with protesters throwing objects at police, lighting two vehicles on fire and breaking windows.

The protest, organized by the Divest for Palestine collective and anti-capitalist group CLAC, was meant to denounce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as the city hosts the 70th annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from Nov. 22 to 25.

Organizers said the purpose of the protest was to demonstrate against what he called NATO's "complicity with Israel's military while it's conducting its genocide in Gaza." They also pointed to "war crimes in Lebanon, Syria" and other injustices in the region.

While Canada and the United States are NATO members, Israel is not.

Plante blamed the property damage on what she called "professional vandals" who she said are known to police. She accused them of co-opting the protests to carry out violence and said more arrests are expected once police examine more footage from the events.

No place for hate at protests: Trudeau
--------------------------------------

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also addressed the protests on Monday. 

"In democracy, we will always defend freedom of expression, of protesting, of expressing our opposition on certain positions, but there is never place for violence, for hate or intimidation," Trudeau told reporters. 

On Saturday, on X, Trudeau called what happened "appalling."

"Acts of antisemitism, intimidation and violence must be condemned wherever we see them," he wrote.

He said the RCMP was in touch with local police, adding "there must be consequences and rioters held accountable."

Montreal rioters should be pursued to full extent of the law, Trudeau says

9 months ago

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opened his remarks at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Montreal, the location of violent anti-NATO protests over the weekend, by saying while people have the right to demonstrate there should never be any violence, and he expects 'those responsible to be pursued and punished under the full extent of the law.'

Over the weekend, Montreal police said they have not received any reports of antisemitic acts or other hate crimes related to the demonstration.

Plante was asked Monday whether Friday's protests were antisemitic, but she said she did not believe they were. 

The mayor noted that the _Service de police de la Ville de Montréal_ (SPVM) is the only police service in the province to have received special training on crowd management, terrorist attacks and cybersecurity. 

"I'm extremely proud of the police force we have here in Montreal. The work will continue," Plante said.

 _[Tout un matin](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/ohdio/premiere/emissions/1124/tout-un-matin)
,_ Dagher said the chaos only lasted about five minutes. 

"It's as if we played a spotless hockey season but all that's talked about is the one goal that went through," Dagher said, after noting the hundreds of demonstrations Montreal police have watched over in the past year.

Mayor Valérie Plante has slammed the “unacceptable” vandalism that occurred during a pro-Palestinian protest in Montreal on Sunday in which demonstrators smashed windows at Concordia University and luxury stores and launched Molotov cocktails at police.

The demonstration, which began around 9:15 p.m., involved some 60 protesters, according to police spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant. [https://t.co/bFPfWeNOaP](https://t.co/bFPfWeNOaP)
>

The protest follows an incident last week in which three individuals were detained after clashes between police and protesters near the Guy-Concordia métro station.

On Monday, Graham Carr, Concordia University’s president, wrote to the campus community, stating that the university is still evaluating the situation but that he is “extremely concerned about the violent escalation of recent protests.”

“Behaviour that contributes to a climate of intimidation cannot be tolerated, and the university will seek to sanction members of the community who engage in such activities,” he added.

A spokesperson for the university confirmed there were no injuries and that an investigation is ongoing.

After the vandalism unfolded Sunday night, images circulated on social media, with the Instagram account Clash MTL appearing to endorse the protest, sharing photos of the destruction.

      

Broken windows are seen at Concordia University’s Hall Building in Montreal on Monday, Sept. Authorities are reviewing security footage to identify those responsible for the vandalism and throwing the incendiary devices.

Plante [took to X to describe the protest](https://x.com/val_plante/status/1840820018743034064?s=46)
 as “unacceptable.”

“The SPVM made the arrests. The conflict has now spilled into Lebanon, between Israel and Hezbollah.

As the anniversary of the Hamas attack nears next week, pro-Palestinian groups are reportedly planning a “week of rage,” organizing further demonstrations against Israel’s ongoing military operations.

Brabant said police would be present at upcoming protests, as usual, to ensure public safety and that they would intervene in cases of criminal activity.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image shows a traffic sign in Montreal displaying "Free Palestine. Escalate now." in July 2024. The evidence confirms that similar signs appeared in Montreal during that time, but the city considered them vandalism. The evidence does not indicate that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante. In fact, the mayor condemned the actions related to the signs.

Therefore, the claim is partially accurate. The image is of a sign in Montreal in July 2024. However, the claim that the sign was authorized by Montreal's Mayor Valérie Plante is false.

Washington CNN  — 

During her [first official White House briefing](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/media/karoline-leavitt-first-press-conference/index.html)
 as President Donald Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt announced that Trump had prevented a “preposterous waste of taxpayer money.” Trump’s team, [she said](https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-briefing-karoline-leavitt-january-28-2025/)
, used the president’s [pause on foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-impact/index.html)
 to thwart a plan in which “there was about to be $50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.”

Leavitt’s Tuesday comments made headlines around the world. And when CNN asked Leavitt and her colleagues for any evidence, another White House official instead pointed us to comments from the State Department — comments that, as we’ll discuss below, did not even repeat Leavitt’s claim of a planned $50 million Gaza condom expenditure, let alone prove the claim.

**In three previous years under Biden, USAID spent _no_ money on condoms in the entire Middle East**: A detailed [federal report published last year](https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/C-and-C-FY2023.pdf)
 said USAID did not provide or fund _any_ condoms in the Middle East in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.

The report, [noted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/28/donald-trump-executive-orders-transgender-troops-dei-covid-us-politics-live?page=with:block-679977268f086189f840e07b#block-679977268f086189f840e07b)
 by The Guardian on Tuesday, said the only Middle East contraceptives provided or funded by USAID during that three-year period went to the country of Jordan in fiscal 2023. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.” She did not specify how much of the $102 million in funding was intended for contraception, let alone for condoms in particular.

In an email to reporters earlier Tuesday, Bruce said the entity that was supposed to get $102 million is the International Medical Corps – a US-based organization that [operates two field hospitals in Gaza](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/gaza/)
.

In a statement to CNN on Wednesday, International Medical Corps said that it has received about $68 million from the US Agency for International Development for Gaza operations since October 7, 2023, the day of Hamas’ major attack on Israel. And the president himself told an even more dramatic version of the story in a speech on Wednesday, saying that “we identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

But there are at least five big reasons to be skeptical that the story is true.

**The White House offered no evidence for the story**: Leavitt provided no proof for her claim that there was ever a federal plan to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza. This was “a small order of injectables and progestin-only contraceptive pills” totaling about $46,000.

**Total worldwide USAID condom spending is far less than $50 million**: In the 2023 fiscal year, USAID provided or funded a global total of about $7.1 million worth of male condoms and about $1.1 million worth of female condoms, overwhelmingly to countries in Africa, according to the federal report.

In other words, Leavitt was essentially claiming Tuesday that the Biden administration had decided to provide more than six times the 2023 worldwide value of condoms to a single tiny territory that has [about 2.1 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/middleeast/israel-population-migration-war-intl/index.html)
 and that is in a region that usually does not receive condoms from the US.

A former senior Biden official who worked on Gaza aid issues told CNN that Leavitt’s story about a $50 million condom expenditure for Gaza was “imaginary.” The former official said: “It’s a lie, they are making s\*\*\* up.”

**The State Department would not repeat Leavitt’s claim**: The White House official pointed to a series of social media posts from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who listed specific examples of how Trump’s aid pause had prevented what Bruce called unjustified spending that wouldn’t make the country “safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

But Bruce did not mention $50 million for condoms in Gaza.

Instead, Bruce was vague about how much condom spending was supposedly stopped. While International Medical Corps has [publicly discussed](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story/youre-pregnant-in-gaza-what-happens-next/)
 its reproductive and sexual health services in Gaza, among various other services from cardiology to orthopedics, the organization said in the Wednesday statement that “no US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms.”

The organization said the US funding has paid for the two hospitals’ “lifesaving medical care” for roughly 33,000 civilians per month. Like Bruce’s Tuesday social media posts and email to reporters, this Wednesday statement did not repeat Leavitt’s claim that there was $50 million in planned funding for condoms in particular; it provided no dollar figure at all for condoms.

**Experts expressed doubt about Leavitt’s story — or simply called it wrong**: Experts on US aid to Gaza and global health aid were baffled by the claim that the US had been planning to spend $50 million on condoms in Gaza.

“We have asked around, and no one is sure what this is referring to,” said Steve Fake, a spokesperson for Anera, an aid nonprofit that has partnered with USAID on a [five-year, $50 million health initiative in Gaza](https://www.anera.org/press/usaid-partners-with-anera-to-launch-gaza-health-recovery-activity-to-improve-health-services-in-gaza/)
.

Fake said this Anera program has “definitely no purchase of condoms” and added: “Our whole program is $50 (million) and represents a significant portion of total US aid going to Gaza.”

[Matthew Kavanagh](https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/experts/matthew-m-kavanagh/)
, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics, said that after doing some digging into Leavitt’s claim, “It seems clear to me there was no $50 million in condoms going to Gaza. [](#maincontent)

Fact check: $50 million for condoms in Gaza? [She wrote](https://x.com/statedeptspox/status/1884404233052831790)
: “Example 1: Condoms. Trump’s freeze, the organization said, halts US funding for hospital services like performing about 30 lifesaving surgeries per day, delivering about 20 babies per day, running an emergency room receiving up to 200 patients per day, and operating one of Gaza’s only neonatal intensive care units and only stabilization centers for severely malnourished children.

“If the stop-work order remains in place, we will be unable to sustain these activities beyond the next week or so,” the organization said.

A State Department official issued an additional statement to CNN on Wednesday that asserted that the funding Trump had stopped from going to the International Medical Corps “included” funds for family planning, emergency contraceptives and prevention of sexually transmitted infections."

His comments followed claims by US President Donald Trump, who earlier this month alleged that his administration had “identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas.”

The claim was first announced by White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt in her first press briefing, saying the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had found “that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza.” However, the administration provided no evidence to support the assertion.

A review of publicly available USAID data from 2007 to 2023 contradicts the claim, showing no record of condom shipments to Gaza. [World](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world)

**WASHINGTON**

Billionaire Elon Musk backtracked Tuesday on his claim that the US had been intending to send $50 million worth of condoms to the Gaza Strip.

“First of all, some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,” Musk told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about fact-checking reports that million of dollars were actually earmarked towards the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in Gaza province of Mozambique.

“We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes," he said.

"I’m not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere. And that is really an enormous number of condoms," Musk continued.

"If it went to Mozambique instead of Gaza…okay, that's not as bad. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

_“DOGE and OMB also found that there was about to be 50 million taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms in Gaza. That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So, that’s what this pause is focused on, being good stewards of tax dollars.”_

Fact-checks by CNN ([Source](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/gaza-condoms-fact-check)) and other sources found no evidence to support the claim that US taxpayer money was going to fund condoms in Gaza. USAID did not spend money on condoms in the Middle East in recent fiscal years, and Elon Musk retracted the claim.

* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing.

The Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight took place on November 15, 2024, at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Paul_vs._Mike_Tyson) and [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/40244442/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-watch-rules-date-location-more). The fight was streamed on Netflix.

However, according to [Netflix Tudum](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/jake-paul-vs-mike-tyson-live-release-date-news), the fight took place on May 2, 2024. <image:17>, <image:8370>, <image:8372>, <image:8378>, <image:8388>


### Evidence from `web_search`
The image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is not authentic and was created using artificial intelligence tools, according to factchecker.gr ([https://www.factchecker.gr/2024/11/16/ai-generated-image-of-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/](https://www.factchecker.gr/2024/11/16/ai-generated-image-of-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/)). The University at Buffalo also published an article about a Reuters fact-check article addressing the fake photo ([https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/news-and-events/news.host.html/content/shared/engineering/home/articles/media-mentions/2024-media-coverage/fact-check--mike-tyson-did-not-pose-with-palestinian-flag-ahead-.detail.html)).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows Mike Tyson posing with the Palestinian flag. <image:8404>, <image:8405>, <image:17>


## Elaboration
The claim is not accurate. The image of Mike Tyson with the Palestinian flag is AI-generated, according to factchecker.gr ([https://www.factchecker.gr/2024/11/16/ai-generated-image-of-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/](https://www.factchecker.gr/2024/11/16/ai-generated-image-of-mike-tyson-with-palestinian-flag/)). The fight date is also inconsistent, with some sources stating November 15, 2024, and others May 2, 2024.

Starmer urges unity at home and reiterates call for ceasefire in Middle East
============================================================================

This article is more than 9 months old

Prime minister says UK should ‘unequivocally stand with Jewish community’ and reflects on deaths in Israel

Keir Starmer has called for unity in Britain and urged the nation to “unequivocally stand with the Jewish community”, as he reiterated calls for immediate ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon on the anniversary of the 7 October attacks.

The prime minister described it as “the darkest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust”, reflecting on the deaths of more than 1,000 people who were murdered by Hamas, including the young people massacred at a music festival, raped and brutally tortured in the aftermath.

While he stood firm in his commitment to help “bring the hostages home”, he said “we must not look the other way as civilians bear the ongoing dire consequences of this conflict in the Middle East”.

He continued: “We will not falter in our pursuit of peace and on this day of pain and sorrow, we honour those we lost, and continue in our determination to return those still held hostage, help those who are suffering, and secure a better future for the Middle East.”

His comments come as the government earlier advised [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel)
 to show “restraint”, while the prime minister had warned that “sparks” from the Middle East conflict could “light touchpapers in our communities at home”.

A series of rallies and demonstrations took place over the weekend, with more expected to take place around the country on Monday.

In London, the Met police said [17 people had been arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/05/tens-of-thousands-join-pro-palestinian-protest-in-london)
 after Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march in central London, as part of a “significant” policing operation in response to planned protest and memorial events.

On Sunday afternoon, thousands of people arrived at a memorial event being held in London’s Hyde Park, organised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council and other groups. The war is deepening and it is not moving towards the peace that we need, so we are urging the steps that will take us towards that peaceful settlement”.

The prime minister, in an article [for the Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/year-of-war-has-spread-vile-hatred-in-uk-says-keir-starmer-nsc3k29jz)
, called out the “vile hatred” that had been directed towards Jews and Muslims since the 7 October attacks.

!Relatives carry the bodies of their deceased loved ones wrapped in shrouds in Deir el-Balah <image:1011>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Relatives carry the bodies of their deceased loved ones wrapped in shrouds after an Israeli attack in Deir el-Balah, Gaza. Clearly there’s a detachment from the British public opinion and what the government are saying.”

The former Conservative foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said what was needed from Israelis and Palestinians was “leadership that is prepared not to forget the past, but to move on to a political dialogue”.

    ! Supporters waved Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages still being held by Hamas in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 as they chanted “bring them home”.

The mother of the sole British hostage still in Gaza a year after she was taken by Hamas said her daughter has been “stripped of every human right” and remains “in hell”, as she called for her safe return.

Mandy Damari spoke about her daughter Emily publicly for the first time, through tears, and called for the release of the 101 hostages who remained in Gaza, saying each one was someone’s child, grandchild, parent or grandparent.

“How is it that she \[Emily\] is still imprisoned there after one year?” Damari said.

“Why isn’t the whole world, especially Britain, fighting every moment to secure her release?”

Also at the event was Tracy-Ann Oberman, the actor and playwright, who said “we must not forget our humanity”, adding it was “heartening” to see so many people in attendance.

“I’m here today because it’s about memorial and remembrance,” she said. There are no further scheduled charter flights, but the situation would be kept under review.

Content: "It has strongly denied allegations of genocide, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

The government is also facing calls to "urgently" recognise the state of Palestine - including from Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Jeremy Wright.

Sir Jeremy told MPs he he had changed his mind the timeframe for such a move - traditionally seen as being part of a "two-state solution" - over the rhetoric coming from the Israeli government.

'Desperately needed aid'
------------------------

During the debate, protesters gathered outside Parliament to demand the end of arms sales to Israel, something that was repeatedly echoed by MPs, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The MP, who now sits as an independent, is calling for a public inquiry to uncover what he called the "murky history of what's gone on, the murky arms sales and the complicity in appalling acts of genocide".

He has tabled a draft bill to set up an inquiry to examine the "any UK military, economic or political cooperation" with Israel, with powers to question ministers and officials.

The bill is backed by prominent left-wing Labour MPs including Diane Abbott and Richard Burgon, four independent MPs, two Greens and members of Plaid Cymru and the SNP.

It has been scheduled for debate on 4 July, but is unlikely to become law without government backing.

Corbyn was among the MPs calling for a total embargo on the sale of arms to Israel - including parts for F-35 fighter jets.

Hamish Falconer said the UK had already taken steps to "ensure that weapons directly for use in Gaza have been suspended," and had stopped supplying F-35 parts "directly to Israel".

But he said the UK would continue to supply parts to the "global pool" of F-35 spares, as this was needed to help "the defence of Nato allies" and support the Ukraine war effort.

When it was put to him that Ukraine did not use F-35s, he said the planes were needed for the redeployment of F-15s, which were used in the fight against Russia.

But Corbyn and other critics insist the government's explanations lack credibility and they must know that the parts are being used to attack Palestinians in Gaza.

The Lib Dems are also urging a tougher stance from the government on Israel.

At prime minster's questions, Sir Ed Davey urged Keir Starmer to "push at the UN Security Council for humanitarian corridors to get the desperately needed aid urgently into Gaza".

Sir Keir said that the government is "working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in".

Israel launched its military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At least 54,607 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 4,335 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March, according to the territory's health ministry.

Protesters lobbied Parliament as MPs debated Gaza

Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure from some of his own MPs to take further action against Israel over what they say is a genocide in Gaza.

At prime minister's questions, Sir Keir described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire.

He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.

But his words were not enough to satisfy opposition critics and left-wing Labour MPs, who are calling on the government to take stronger action against Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers.

It comes after aid distribution centres in Gaza were closed for the day, with the Israeli military warning roads leading to the sites will be considered "combat zones".

At least 27 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire close to a distribution centre on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency.

The Israel Defence Forces say its troops fired shots after identifying suspects who moved towards them "deviating from the designated access routes".

The UK's Middle East Minister Hamish Falconer faced the anger of backbench Labour MPs - many of whom were wearing red "stop arming Israel" badges - in the House of Commons.

Falconer said he was "appalled" by Palestinians being killed when trying to access aid sites, adding: "We call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events for the perpetrators to be held to account."

He added: "Israel's unjustified block on aid into Gaza needs to end - it is inhumane.

"Israel must immediately allow the United Nations and aid partners to safely deliver all types of aid at scale to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity."

Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan called for Mr Netanyahu and "the other murderous figures who are responsible" to be sanctioned.

"Words are not enough," she said, as she called for a date for when the government would impose restrictions on them.

Labour MP Paula Barker said the history books "will not be kind" to the government unless action is taken.

"What more evidence do we need to call this exactly what it is?

! A deliberate policy of annexation and genocide," she added.

Her call for the government to acknowledge that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza was echoed by a number of MPs.

Falconer said that it was a matter for a "competent court to determine".

He added that he understood their frustrations, and promised further action if the UK could not persuade the Israeli government to "change course".

Israel says it is working to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas and get back hostages they have taken."

France braced as far right and leftwing parties plan rallies in wake of Le Pen decision

French prime minister calls for rival gatherings to be held in a spirit of ‘calm, mutual respect and responsibility’

France’s far right is hoping for a massive public show of support tomorrow in a “people’s protest” against [Marine Le Pen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen)
 being barred from standing for president in 2027.

The Rassemblement National (National Rally – RN) party called for a nationwide demonstration under the banner “Save Democracy” after Le Pen was [found guilty](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/marine-le-pen-guilty-national-rally-embezzlement-fake-jobs-scam)
 in a €4m (£3.4m) embezzlement trial.

Leftwing and centrist parties have also called for separate gatherings in and around the capital in support of the law being enforced – as well to back the court, and [judges who have been subject to death threats](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/01/marine-le-pen-ban-political-and-partisan-says-french-far-right-leader-jordan-bardella)

The prime minister, [François Bayrou](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/from-farmer-to-premier-who-is-francois-bayrou-the-new-french-prime-minister)
, has called for the rival rallies to be held in a spirit of “calm, mutual respect and a spirit of responsibility” to avoid clashes.

The _Ouest-France_ newspaper said the demonstrations would be a “battle of images”. Bayrou was cleared of embezzlement.

Rightwing French MP Éric Ciotti, who supports Le Pen, and has suggested overturning the law barring her and others convicted of fraud from public office, is under investigation on allegations of misuse of public funds.

In 2022, former PM and presidential hopeful [François Fillon and his Welsh wife, Penelope](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/french-appeal-court-upholds-conviction-of-francois-fillon-for-embezzlement)

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen was found to have been ‘at the heart’ of an organised system of embezzlement. The court found Le Pen to be at “the heart” of this system and guilty of directly organising eight fictitious contracts and instigating a wider fake jobs scheme.

Le Pen and her colleagues are not the only French politicians to have been accused of financial impropriety. The second option raises the prospect of a convicted fraudster entering the Elysée wearing an electronic anklet.

While the RN is hoping for a show of strength this weekend, polls suggest Le Pen may not have the public support she is counting on and claims.

_ magazine found 61% of French people thought her conviction justified and two out of three of those quizzed said the immediate application of a bar on standing for public office was “fair”; 43% said the condemnation and punishment was “extremely justified”.

Stewart Chau, director of polling at Vérian Group, said France was engaged in a “battle of opinion” and that the polls had to be viewed with caution.

“If 60% of people believe this justice is impartial and think [Marine Le Pen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen)
 is not above the law and should be judged like anyone else, it still means 40% do not agree and think it is a political decision, which is not an insignificant number,” Chau told the _Observer_.

He said he did not think there would be a massive mobilisation in support of the RN on Sunday.

“The RN is trying to wrap this judgement against it up as a wider issue of an attack on democracy. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media.

The RN called for a “peaceful popular mobilisation” after Le Pen was found guilty last Monday of embezzling European Parliament funds through a huge fake jobs scam. A 10-year investigation was followed by a nine-week trial last autumn and the three judges delivered their verdict after a three-month deliberation.

Le Pen and eight other RN European Parliament members, who all denied the charges and have appealed, were judged to have been part of an organised “system” of embezzlement between 2004 and 2016 in which European funds supposed to be used to pay EU parliamentary assistants were used to pay the party’s workers in France.

Le Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, two suspended and two to be served with an electronic tag."

French left protests over new PM Barnier

Michel Barnier told French TV he is open to including members of the left in his government

However, Mr Barnier's survival may depend on the votes of the far-right party, although they have made clear they will not join his government.

The premier began forming a government a day after he took office, following a meeting with Mr Macron.

After talks with the leaders of the right-wing Republicans and the president's centrist Ensemble group, he said discussions were going very well and were "full of energy".

In a TV interview on Friday evening, Mr Barnier, 73, said he was willing to select ministers from across the political spectrum, including “people from the left”.

Demonstrators gathered in Nantes on Saturday as France braces itself for protests

Protests are taking place in France against the appointment of Michel Barnier as the country’s new prime minister.

The demonstrations were called by parties on the political left, whose candidate for prime minister was rejected by President Emmanuel Macron.

Mr Macron chose the former EU Brexit negotiator 60 days after parliamentary elections left France in political deadlock, with three powerful blocs - of which the left was the largest - but none able to form a majority in the National Assembly.

In a televised interview, Mr Barnier - himself from the centre right - said he was open to forming a government including members of the left.

Lucie Castets, an unelected senior civil servant, has vowed Mr Barnier will face a vote of confidence

Parties of the left, however, are angry that their candidate for prime minister, Lucie Castets, was rejected by Mr Macron because she had no chance of surviving a vote of confidence in the national Assembly.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a veteran firebrand from the radical France Unbowed party, has called for marches across France and for the "most powerful mobilisation possible". Some unions and youth groups have said they will take part.

"We have a prime minister completely dependent on National Rally," said Ms Castets who complained that she, like millions of French voters, felt betrayed and that the president had in effect ended up governing with the far right.

----------------------------------------------------](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c36nd5l8k6wo)

Entering the prime minister's residence on Friday evening, Mr Barnier promised to address "the challenges, the anger, the suffering, the feeling of abandonment, of injustice running through many of our cities, suburbs and rural areas".

He told the TF1 channel that as prime minister, he would address national issues including pension reform, migration and the country’s economic situation.

Ex-prime minister Gabriel Attal, whose centrist bloc came second in the election, said after talks with Mr Barnier that Ensemble was prepared to join a broad front with the republican right and republican left, with "no desire to block or offer unconditional support".

Mr Barnier himself comes from the Republicans, and party leader Laurent Wauquiez said his decision depended on the prime minister's plans: "For the moment, nothing has been decided."

Some on the left said it was their own fault they ended up with Mr Barnier as prime minister.

Socialist Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo pointed out that the president had considered former Socialist prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, for the job but that he had been turned down by his own party.

Another Socialist mayor, Karim Bouamrane, blamed intransigence from other parts of the left alliance: "The path they chose was 100% or nothing - and here we are with nothing."

National Rally leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella have already stressed they will not join the Barnier government, but will wait and see what policies he brings to parliament before they decide on a vote of confidence.

The left are threatening a vote of confidence but, without the backing of the far right, will not be able to bring Mr Barnier down.

"He's a man who has never gone too far when he's spoken about National Rally; he's never cast us out - he's a man for discussion," said Marine Le Pen, indicating they could allow him to continue in office.

Without her party's backing, Mr Barnier would not be able to muster the 289 votes in the 577-seat Assembly, simply by relying on the support of the centrists and the Republicans.

The Wikipedia article specifically mentions protests against the RN's victory in the European Parliament election and subsequent legislative elections.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:20> This image shows the 'French' Left who is rioting against Le Pen's victory in the first round of the French parliamentary elections in 2024."

## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results discuss protests in France related to the National Rally (RN) party and Marine Le Pen. One source, from Wikipedia, details the 2024 French protests against the RN's victory in the European Parliament election and subsequent legislative elections, mentioning that some protesters carried pro-Palestinian messages. The protests began on June 9, 2024, and were organized by various political parties, unions, and activist groups. The Guardian article from April 5, 2025, discusses rallies planned by both far-right and left-wing parties following Marine Le Pen's conviction. The BBC News article from September 7, 2024, reports on protests against the appointment of Michel Barnier as prime minister, organized by parties on the political left.

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision), and [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o). The Wikipedia article includes <image:i>, the Guardian article includes <image:6003> and <image:6004>, and the BBC article includes <image:6007> and <image:6012>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an image of a protest (<image:8409>). PBS NewsHour published an image of a protest in Washington D.C. demanding a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war (<image:8410>). The Voice of America published an article about tens of thousands of people marching in Europe calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza (<image:8411>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that protests occurred in France in 2024 related to the National Rally (RN) party and Marine Le Pen. The Wikipedia article specifically mentions protests against the RN's victory in the European Parliament election and subsequent legislative elections. The image search results show a protest with pro-Palestinian messages and a swastika.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts the "French Left" rioting. However, the web search results indicate that the protests were organized by various political parties, unions, and activist groups, which could include the left.

To fully verify the claim, it would be necessary to confirm the image's context, including the specific date, location, and the political affiliation of the protesters.

Content: "Around 62,000 people protested across France, according to police. 

Many pointed to the growing strength of reactionary political forces, in [France](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/)
 but also in the United States.

In the French capital, thousands of people took to the streets.

"Fascism is gangrene from Washington to Paris," read one placard. 

"The far right is on the rise everywhere in Europe, it's scary because in France we see far-right ideas becoming more and more commonplace, even among ministers in this government," said Evelyne Dourille, a 74-year-old pensioner.

One American protester said similar demonstrations should be taking place in the United States.

"America is sliding towards fascism," said the 55-year-old woman.

Aurelie Trouve, a lawmaker for the hard-left [France Unbowed](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france-unbowed/)
 (LFI) party, pointed to the growing popularity of the far-right party of [Marine Le Pen](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/marine-le-pen/)
 in France.

"Far-right ideas are contaminating even the government," she said.

In the southern port city of [Marseille](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/marseille/)
, some 3,300 people took to the streets, while 2,600 protested in [Lille](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/lille/)
 in the north, according to police.

"Against state Islamophobia" and "Tesla is the new swastika," said some of the placards.

Ines Frehaut, a student who took part in her first demonstration, said some of the statements of France's hardline interior minister worried her. 

"When you see what has said about Islam, Algeria and the wearing of the veil, it's serious!" she said.  

The protests took place a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

"The situation is serious," the Human Rights League said, pointing to an "alarming increase" in racist acts. 

"There is a global reactionary offensive against foreigners and their children, against Muslims," added Dominique Sopo, head of of SOS Racisme, also pointing to increasing racist and anti-Semitic acts.

In the runup to the rallies the LFI party caused an uproar in France by publishing the image of Cyril Hanouna, one of the most influential stars of right-wing media in the country, as part of a campaign calling on people to turn out for the anti-racism protests.

The image pictured Hanouna, who was born into a Jewish family that had immigrated to France from Tunisia. Key LFI figures admitted publishing the image was a "mistake" and it was withdrawn.

The evidence indicates that protests against the rise of the far right and racism, including the use of Palestinian flags, occurred in France. The image search results show the swastika in various contexts, including neo-Nazi rallies. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts the "French Left" rioting. The presence of a swastika in the image is concerning and requires further investigation to understand its context and the protesters' affiliations.

FRANCE 24 reports that on March 22, 2025, tens of thousands of people protested in France against racism and the rise of the far right, with some protesters carrying Palestinian flags (<image:0>).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that protests against the rise of the far right and racism, including the use of Palestinian flags, occurred in France. The image search results show the swastika in various contexts, including neo-Nazi rallies. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image in the claim depicts the "French Left" rioting. The presence of a swastika in the image is concerning and requires further investigation to understand its context and the protesters' affiliations.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web search results discuss protests in France related to the National Rally (RN) party and Marine Le Pen. One source, from Wikipedia, details the 2024 French protests against the RN's victory in the European Parliament election and subsequent legislative elections, mentioning that some protesters carried pro-Palestinian messages. The protests began on June 9, 2024, and were organized by various political parties, unions, and activist groups. The Guardian article from April 5, 2025, discusses rallies planned by both far-right and left-wing parties following Marine Le Pen's conviction. The BBC News article from September 7, 2024, reports on protests against the appointment of Michel Barnier as prime minister, organized by parties on the political left.

The sources are: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_French_protests_against_the_National_Rally), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/france-braced-as-far-right-and-leftwing-parties-plan-rallies-in-wake-of-le-pen-decision), and [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1l51y6p171o).

### Evidence from `image_search`
The New York Times published an image of a protest (<image:8409>). PBS NewsHour published an image of a protest in Washington D.C. demanding a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war (<image:8410>). The Voice of America published an article about tens of thousands of people marching in Europe calling for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza (<image:8411>).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that protests occurred in France in 2024 related to the National Rally (RN) party and Marine Le Pen. The Wikipedia article specifically mentions protests against the RN's victory in the European Parliament election and subsequent legislative elections. The image search results show a protest with pro-Palestinian messages and a swastika.

The evidence does not explicitly state that the image depicts the "French Left" rioting. However, the web search results indicate that the protests were organized by various political parties, unions, and activist groups, which could include the left.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Palestine or France. The evidence confirms that protests against the rise of the far right and racism, including the use of Palestinian flags, occurred in France. However, the claim's assertion that the image depicts the "French Left" rioting cannot be definitively verified with the available information. Further investigation is needed to confirm the image's context, including the specific date, location, and the political affiliation of the protesters.

Content: "<image:1099>

AN IMAGE SHARED by Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister, that purports to show Irish rock stars holding Israeli flags is AI-generated.

The image, which is said to show Bono and Bob Geldof staging a “two-man vigil” outside the Israeli Embassy in Dublin, was first posted by a satirical social media account, which has confirmed to _The Journal_ that it was created by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and was never meant to be taken seriously.

“In the midst of a genocide, with thousands of maimed orphaned children going to bed without having eaten for days or water to wash their wounds, Bono and Geldof decided to show their solidarity with the rogue Apartheid state responsible,” wrote Yanis Varoufakis on X.

Varoufakis’s 18 December X post includes a screenshot of another post by the account Dr Harold News, which showed an image of Bono and Geldof in a field holding Israeli flags.

! <image:1100>

“BREAKING: Bono and Bob Geldof stage two-man vigil outside Israeli Embassy in Dublin,” that post reads.

Varoufakis’s post has been shared more than 600 times and was viewed on X more than 306,100 times. It was also shared further on other social media platforms, including multiple posts on Facebook that copied Varoufakis’s post word-for-word.

Varoufakis was Greece’s minister for finance for much of 2015, gaining international recognition during the country’s debt crisis.

However, there are signs that the image he shared may not be real.

The picture is set in a field surrounded by verdant hedges, unlike t[he area outside the Israeli embassy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+of+Israel+to+Ireland/@53.3323915,-6.2317407,3a,75y,311.48h,82.18t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.817675335494144%26panoid%3D5IbuSW6FiE9GXIaxKw2zEw%26yaw%3D311.48243025252697!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x48670ec099e519d1:0x8e1e9dcda8ab035e!8m2!3d53.3323109!4d-6.2323792!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F12qh79y9q?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
, which, aside from some leafy residential gardens across the road, is located in a concrete-laden area of Dublin city.

Last week, Israel announced it [is closing that embassy down](https://www.thejournal.ie/israel-closes-embassy-dublin-6572656-Dec2024/?jrnl_lg=1)
, following Ireland’s decision to intervene in a case taken by South Africa against Israel for genocide that is currently before the International Court of Justice.

The clothes worn by the two rock stars in the image are inconsistent, with Bono’s buttons being of various sizes (including one on the bottom of this suit jacket’s lapel), and a ridge appearing on one sleeve of Geldof’s jacket, but not the other.

These are all indications that the image might be AI-generated.

Reverse image searches for the image, or similar images that may have been manipulated, all indicate that the Dr Harold News account was the first to post the picture.

“My page is clearly labelled ‘satire’ and ‘fake news’, so I wasn’t expecting anyone to assume the photo is real,” the person behind the account told _The Journal._

“I can confirm the image was created by Grok AI and the tweet is satire.”

Grok AI is an Artificial Intelligence platform that can create images based on image prompts. <image:1098>\

An X post shows an image of U2 singer Bono and Irish singer Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags, supposedly contradicting their views on apartheid.

> [](https://twitter.com/Resist_05/status/1868896790420111784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

**Verdict: False**

This image was generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

**Fact Check:**

Bono, lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, has been known to get involved in politics throughout his entire musical career. As the co-founder of ONE, his relief efforts were put on a global stage thanks to a partnership with [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2022/10/30/how-apple-and-u2-made-an-unforgettable-blunder-and-whose-fault-it-was/)
, although the public thought of it as intrusive and did not take to that very well.

A post on X shows a picture of Bono along with fellow Irish singer Bob Geldof holding Israeli flags in front of a garden. Check Your Fact ran the image though the AI detection website [TrueMedia](https://detect.truemedia.org/media/analysis?id=BBzITUJkKJNkZYaT30Qz8atnpog.jpg&post=ZUF9Gh0ZZeobrTbsIraImQ==)
, which determined that there was substantial evidence of manipulation.

 for any authentic pictures of Bono holding the Israeli flag turned up empty, as well.

According to [Lead Stories](https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2024/12/fact-check-fake-image-shows-bono-and-bob-geldof-waving-israeli-flags.html)
, the image was first circulated by an X account that is known for fake news and satire, even saying so in it’s bio.

Social media users circulated the AI-generated image of Irish singers Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli flag.

Source : X/Modified by Logically Facts

* * *

The Verdict: Fake The image, first shared by a satirical account, is fake and was likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

### **What is the claim?**

An image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag has circulated online, claiming that they are endorsing “apartheid”. In 2023, Bono [condemned](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/culture-stories/1708419663-u2-draft)
 the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and voiced support for peace between the two sides.

### **The verdict**

The viral image of Irish musicians Bono and Bob Geldof holding the Israeli national flag is a fabrication, most likely created using Artificial Intelligence.

     indicating that it had [shorted](/wiki/Shorted "Shorted")

Routh was active in recruiting volunteers to fight in Ukraine's war against Russia, and had a range of eclectic political views, although he was registered as a Democrat and made anti-Trump posts online.

In an earlier letter this year, the 59-year-old had asked to be used in a prisoner swap with another country like Russia so he could have a "swift and useful" death.

Trump assassination attempt suspect can represent himself at trial, judge rules

Routh has said he and his attorneys "a million miles apart"

A man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course last year will be allowed to represent himself at trial, a court has ruled.

Ryan Routh, 59, is charged with trying to assassinate then-candidate Trump by aiming a rifle through a fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.

US District Judge Aileen Cannon approved his request to represent himself at trial, but ordered court-appointed attorneys to remain on standby. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm charges.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the assassination charge.

Routh has been held in a Florida jail since last September, when he was arrested on a main highway after fleeing Trump's golf course. He had been spotted with his rifle barrel poking through a fence at the oceanfront golf course before a Secret Service agent saw him and fired in his direction.

Police say Routh hid for nearly 12 hours in the bushes waiting for Trump, who was playing golf.

Court records suggest Routh had been plotting his attack on the then-presidential candidate for months.

He has a long criminal record, including a felony gun conviction for owning a fully automatic machine gun, and was barred from owning firearms as a result.

Routh's alleged plot was the second attempt on Trump's life as he ran for office."

The decades-long military involvement of the United States in the Middle East expanded once again this week after its warplanes [bombed](/news/2025/6/22/satellite-images-show-damage-from-us-strikes-on-irans-fordow-nuclear-site)
 at least three of Iran’s nuclear facilities.

According to a briefing by US General Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, seven B-2 stealth bombers, each valued at approximately $2.1bn, dropped at least 14 bunker-buster bombs worth millions on Fordow and Natanz.

In total, more than 125 US aircraft participated in the mission, including bombers, fighters, tankers, surveillance aircraft, and support crews, all costing hundreds of millions of dollars to deploy and operate.

![INTERACTIVE-Bunker buster bombs-Iran Israel gbu57 b2 bomber-2025-1750307369](/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-Bunker-buster-bombs-JUNE16-2025-1750307369.png?w=770&resize=770%2C962&quality=80)

The US spends more on its military than any other country in the world, more than the next nine countries combined, spending about three times more than China and nearly seven times more than Russia.

In 2024, the US spent $997bn on its military, accounting for 37 percent of all global military spending, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).

The human cost of US-led wars
-----------------------------

According to an analysis by Brown University’s [Watson Institute](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human)
 of International & Public Affairs, US-led wars since 2001 directly caused the deaths of about 940,000 people across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and other post-9/11 conflict zones.

This does not include indirect deaths, namely those caused by loss of access to food, healthcare, or war-related diseases. In Iraq, about 315,000 people were directly killed during the war.

Together, they account for at least 558,000 direct deaths between October 2001 and August 2021, according to the Watson Institute.

The economic cost of US-led wars
--------------------------------

The US has spent an estimated $5.8 trillion funding its more than two decades of war.

This includes $2.1 trillion spent by the Department of Defense (DOD), $1.1 trillion by Homeland Security, $884bn to increase the DOD base budget, $465bn on veterans’ medical care, and an additional $1 trillion in interest payments on loans taken out to fund the war.

US continues to pay for its wars
--------------------------------

In addition to the $5.8 trillion already spent, the US is expected to spend at least $2.2 trillion on obligations for veterans’ care over the next 30 years.

This brings the total estimated cost of US wars since 2001 to $8 trillion.

US funding of Israel’s genocide in Gaza
---------------------------------------

Israel has consistently been the largest recipient of US foreign aid, having received at least $251.2bn in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959, according to Brown University’s Watson Institute.​​ Since 2016, the US has committed to giving Israel [$3.8bn](/news/2024/5/9/which-bombs-has-the-united-states-stopped-shipping-to-israel)
 per year under a 10-year memorandum of understanding, which runs through 2028. Most of this is allocated as Foreign Military Financing.

![INTERACTIVE-COST OF WAR-US military aid to Israel war on Gaza-1750770933](/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/INTERACTIVE-COST-OF-WAR-US-military-aid-to-Israel-war-on-Gaza-1750770933.png?quality=80)

However, in the year following the October 2023 attacks, the US provided an additional $17.9bn in military aid to Israel, the highest annual total ever. This includes at least 7,052 soldiers, 8,189 contractors, and 14,874 allied troops.

Half a million people killed in Afghanistan, Iraq wars
------------------------------------------------------

The war in [Afghanistan](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2021/afghanistan-visualising-impact-of-war/index.html)
 began on October 7, 2001, as a response to the September 11 attacks and aimed to destroy al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power. Less than two years later, on March 20, 2003, the US and its allies launched the war in [Iraq](/news/longform/2023/4/5/iraq-war-20-years-on-visualising-the-impact-of-the-invasion)
, aiming to eliminate its alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and remove Saddam Hussein from power. This includes $6.8bn in military financing, $4.5bn for missile defence and $4.4bn on replenishing arms to Israel from US stocks.

The human cost of Israel’s genocide in Gaza
-------------------------------------------

According to the [latest](/news/2025/3/18/gaza-tracker)
 casualty figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, as of June 24, 2025:

*   Confirmed killed: at least 56,077
*   Injured: at least 131,848

Since Israel broke the ceasefire on March 18:

*   Confirmed killed: at least 5,759
*   Injured: at least 19,807

Thousands more are feared dead, buried under the rubble.

June 25, 2025

As a ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump holds for a second day, the damage from the 12-day war between Israel and Iran is becoming clearer. Not quite.**](https://trt.global/world/article/39eb19713bb9)

The 12-day conflict also left deep scars on Iran and Israel, strained regional supply chains, and sent ripples through global energy and trade markets.

As the ceasefire holds, the full cost of this war is still unfolding.

**Iran’s toll** 

“The 12-day war between Iran and Israel this June inflicted substantial economic damage across the region, though the burden was uneven,” says Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King’s College London and director of MENA Analytica.

Iran, already under decades of Western sanctions, bore the heavier toll.

In an interview with _TRT World_, Krieg, a defence analyst, estimates total direct and indirect losses between $24–$35 billion, equivalent to approximately 6.3 – 9.2% of Iran’s estimated $380 billion GDP.

US and Israeli strikes degraded Iran’s nuclear infrastructure and caused a sharp drop in Tehran’s oil exports. Damage to energy installations and military infrastructure threatens to deepen Iran’s structural weaknesses and delay its post-war recovery. 

“The war has deepened Iran’s fiscal and social challenges, with lasting implications for its internal stability,” says Aimen Jamil, an Islamabad-based expert on Iranian affairs.

**US and Israel’s toll**

Israel [spent](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 approximately $5 billion in the first week of strikes on Iran, with daily war costs hitting $725 million—$593 million for offensive operations and $132 million for defence and mobilisation.

Anti-missile systems alone cost Israel between $10 million and $200 million per day, according to [_The Wall Street Journal_](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-war-on-iran-is-costing-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-a-day-1d360353)
_._

Had the conflict continued for a full month, total costs might have [exceeded](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 $12 billion, estimates the Aaron Institute for Economic Policy.

Israel, though economically more resilient, was not unscathed, according to Krieg.

He estimates losses of $11.5 billion to $17.8 billion, or 2.1–3.3% of its $540 billion GDP.

“These figures include military expenditures, infrastructure damage, and the interception of over 400 Iranian missiles,” Krieg adds. <image:8653>\

A visible exodus has also begun.

All these factors have made Israel’s warlike government take a toll, prompting “a visible exodus” of Israel’s dual citizens, alarmed by the frequency and reach of missile attacks on strategic sites like oil refineries and major cities, according to Kreig. 

Israel’s [Central Bureau of Statistics](https://www.jpost.com/tags/central-bureau-of-statistics)
 estimates that more than 80,000 Israelis left the country in 2024, which corresponds to the highest number since the Zionist state’s founding in 1948. [Nearly half a million](https://thecradle.co/articles/nearly-500000-fled-israel-since-7-october#:~:text=Data%20from%20Israel's%20Population%20and,or%20not%2C%20the%20report%20says.)
 have left since October 7, 2023.

Over 10,000 Israelis [evacuated](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-24/ty-article/.premium/how-october-7-is-shaping-support-for-israelis-displaced-by-iranian-missile-attacks/00000197-9e4e-d6fd-ad97-9f5e734d0000)
 in the war’s first week, with more than 36,000 filing for compensation, according to the Israel Tax Authority.

Facing a widening budget deficit, the government is [weighing](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 spending cuts, tax hikes, or increased borrowing, which could push public debt above 75% of GDP.

The Finance Ministry, warning of dwindling reserves, [requested](https://trt.global/world/article/d4fd7043661a)
 $857 million for defence while proposing $200 million in cuts to health, education, and social services.

In a controversial move, Israel’s government recently [imposed a travel ban](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-06-19/ty-article-magazine/.premium/visiting-israeli-expats-are-stranded-in-their-homeland-with-no-way-home/00000197-8929-d6c0-a1b7-e93992780000)
 on Jewish citizens, apparently to slow this outflow.

Experts see it as a sign of Israel’s growing insecurity and reputational damage from different wars it has engaged in. Widespread flight cancellations and rerouted paths raised airline operating costs, although she sees these impacts as “limited and temporary” at the global level.

Content: "Current hotel accommodation costs alone are estimated at 100 million shekels ($29 million).

“In total, the Tax Authority’s Compensation Fund is expected to pay at least 9 billion shekels (nearly $2.7 billion),” the report said.

Naser Abdelkarim, an assistant professor of finance at the American University of Palestine, estimated Israel’s total losses – direct and indirect – could reach as high as $20 billion.

Speaking to Anadolu, Abdelkarim said the conflict had sharply increased Israel’s military expenditures, disrupted employment, and negatively impacted production and business sectors.

He added that Israel faces limited options to offset this widening budget deficit: slashing spending on critical sectors such as health and education, increasing taxes, or borrowing money, potentially pushing its public debt-to-income ratio beyond 75%.

At the official level, Israel’s Finance Ministry has acknowledged its strained resources, recently requesting an additional $857 million for defense, alongside proposed cuts of $200 million from health, education, and social services.

**US: Cost of shift from support to direct involvement**

Initially supporting Israel’s defensive efforts, the US became directly involved on June 22 with a series of strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.

According to the Pentagon, the operation involved 125 US military aircraft, including B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, refueling tankers, and support aircraft.

Seven B-2 bombers targeted Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, while 24 cruise missiles were fired at Isfahan from a submarine. [World](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world)

*   Cumulative total of military operations, missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions
*   US operation targeting Iranian nuclear sites involved 125 military aircraft and expensive ammunition, running a total cost that could be somewhere ‘between $1 billion to $2 billion’

**ISTANBUL**

A shaky ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding for now, offering both nations a chance to assess the extensive damage incurred during 12 days of intense conflict.

The ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday, came after days of direct confrontation that inflicted significant human, economic, and infrastructural losses.

Israel and the US have maintained that the operation achieved its goal of damaging Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but experts and reports highlight the steep financial toll incurred by both nations, particularly Israel.

**Israel’s military expenditure soars**

After initiating the conflict with airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities, Israel faced severe retaliation in the form of hundreds of missiles and drone attacks.

Operating missile defense systems such as Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow cost Israel up to 1 billion shekels ($285 million) per day, according to TheMarker, the economic section of Israeli news outlet Haaretz. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

Moreover, Israel remained on the offensive throughout the conflict, conducting hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian sites.

Each sortie by fighter jets like the advanced F-35 costs approximately $10,000 per flying hour, with additional expenses for refueling aircraft and ammunition. Overall, the Israeli business daily Calcalist estimates Israel’s combined defensive and offensive operations totaled approximately $5 billion.

**Impact in Israel: ‘Never been this level of damage before’**

The cumulative impact of missile damage, reconstruction, and compensations could significantly inflate Israel’s financial burden to double-digit billions.

Israel faces “challenges of a magnitude we’ve never faced in history,” said Shai Aharonovich, head of the Israeli Tax Authority, at a press conference Tuesday.

Amir Dahan, an official with the authority’s Compensation Department, also said “there has never been this level of damage before,” according to Calcalist.

The Israeli government expects to pay over 5 billion shekels ($1.5 billion) in property damage claims and evacuations, with around 40,000 claims already filed and more anticipated, the report said.

Some 25,000 claims were made in Tel Aviv, 10,800 in Ashkelon, and 2,600 in Haifa and Acre, according to Tax Authority data.

Approximately 15,000 people have been evacuated from their homes, with about 11,000 accommodated in hotels and another 4,000 staying with friends and relatives.

The government finances two-week hotel stays, with extensions possible, while those staying privately receive 4,000 shekels (around $1,200). In total, 75 precision-guided weapons were used in the operation.

The B-2 is the most expensive aircraft in US military history, costing approximately $2.2 billion per plane, with operating costs ranging from $130,000 to $150,000 per flight hour, according to The New York Times.

The B-2 bombers used in the Iran strikes flew for approximately 37 hours, with operational costs estimated around $56 million.

The bombers dropped 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs), or bunker buster bombs, designed to penetrate fortified underground structures, on Fordo.

Each GBU-57 costs between $10 million and $20 million, while the Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from submarines are priced at approximately $2 million each.

Overall, defense analyst Andreas Krieg told Turkish broadcaster TRT World that the total cost of the US operation could range from $1 billion to $2 billion."

Israel has completely destroyed more than 1,000 buildings in the Zeitoun and Sabra neighbourhoods of [Gaza City](/news/liveblog/2025/8/24/live-israel-pounds-gaza-protesters-across-globe-denounce-gaza-city-famine)
 since it started its invasion of the city on August 6, trapping hundreds under the rubble, the Palestinian Civil Defence says.

The agency said in a statement on Sunday that ongoing shelling and blocked access routes are preventing many rescue and aid operations in the area.

Emergency workers continue to receive numerous reports of missing people but are unable to respond, while hospitals are overwhelmed by the toll of the attacks, it added.

“There are grave concerns about the continued incursion of Israeli forces into Gaza City, at a time when field crews lack the capacity to deal with the intensity of the ongoing Israeli attacks,” the Civil Defence said.

“There is no safe area in [the Gaza Strip](/news/2025/8/23/israeli-attacks-kill-37-in-gaza-as-more-palestinians-die-from-starvation)
, whether in the north or south, where shelling continues to target civilians in their homes, shelters, and even in their displacement camps.”

Israeli tanks have been rolling into the Sabra neighbourhood as Israel moves to fully occupy Gaza City, forcing close to 1 million Palestinians there southwards.

The Civil Defence’s assertion appears to confirm fears that Israel is planning to fully demolish Gaza City, as it did in Rafah, a campaign that rights advocates say could be aimed at removing all Palestinians from Gaza.

At least three people, including a child, were among the latest victims killed in an attack on a residential apartment on al-Jalaa Street in Gaza City, according to a source in the enclave’s emergency and ambulance department.

The area, where famine has been declared, has been under relentless Israeli bombardment over the last several weeks. Residents reported explosions echoing nonstop through the neighbourhoods, while several buildings were also blown up further north, in the ravaged Jabalia refugee camp.

At least 51 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza on Sunday, including 27 in Gaza City and 24 aid seekers, medical sources told Al Jazeera.

Gaza’s Ministry of Health said eight more people died of [Israeli-induced hunger](/news/2025/8/24/amid-gaza-famine-palestinian-girl-struggles-to-survive)
 as starvation in the enclave intensifies, raising deaths from malnutrition to 289 people, including 115 children, since the war began.

Israeli forces have been routinely opening fire on hungry Palestinians as they attempt to secure meagre aid parcels at the controversial, Israeli and US-backed GHF sites.

‘Impossible’ to stay alive
--------------------------

Commenting on the worsening humanitarian situation, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said that famine is the “last calamity” hitting Gaza, where people are experiencing “hell in all shapes”.

“‘Never Again’ has deliberately become ‘again’. Denial is the most obscene expression of dehumanisation,” Lazzarini wrote on X.

He added that it was time for the Israeli government to allow aid organisations to provide assistance, and for foreign journalists to be allowed into the enclave.

Gaza’s Ministry of Interior warned against Israeli plans to forcibly displace residents from Gaza City and the northern governorates, urging people against leaving their homes despite heavy bombardment.

The ministry called on residents to remain in their communities, or if threatened, to move only to nearby areas rather than relocate to the south.

“We urge citizens and displaced persons residing in Gaza City not to respond to the occupation’s threats and terrorism, and to refuse to be displaced and move to the remaining areas of the central and Khan Younis governorates,” it said.

“There is no safe place in any of the governorates of the Gaza Strip, and the occupation commits the most heinous crimes daily, even bombing the tents of displaced persons in areas it falsely claims are humanitarian or safe.”

Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Palestinians are nonetheless fleeing areas in Gaza City “under intensive Israeli air strikes and also attacks by quadcopters”.

“We met a couple of these families, and they said that it was \[nearly\] impossible for them to stay alive as they were fleeing and quadcopters were opening fire on whatever was moving in that area,” Khoudary said.

“Some Palestinians made it safely and were able to flee, but others were trapped in those areas and are unable to leave,” she added.

A mounting humanitarian crisis
------------------------------

The UN estimates that approximately 92 per cent of all residential buildings in Gaza – around 436,000 homes – have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The resulting debris amounts to nearly 50 million tonnes – an overwhelming quantity of rubble that would take decades to remove under current conditions.

Humanitarian organizations warn that the delay in debris removal and body recovery is not only deepening psychological trauma across Gaza but also threatens to become a public health and environmental catastrophe.

Gaza: Destruction of vital lifting gear halts search for thousands buried under rubble
======================================================================================

22 April 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

Families in Gaza were holding on to the slim chance of finding loved ones buried under the ruins of destroyed homes – but that hope is fading fast.

The destruction of key heavy machinery on Tuesday following reported Israeli airstrikes has brought rescue and recovery efforts to a standstill, making it even harder to reach the estimated 11,000 bodies still trapped under the debris.

According to local authorities, the strikes put a halt to all solid waste and debris removal operations, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told journalists at a briefing in New York.

Until recently, bulldozers and other excavation equipment had been used in painstaking efforts to recover bodies from the wreckage.

One bulldozer operated by Atif Nasr – who before the war worked building and repairing roads – had become vital in the grim task of extracting the remains of loved ones from the rubble.

He was interviewed by a _UN News_ correspondent in Gaza before the strike but now his grim but vital work has come to a standstill after his vehicle was destroyed.

![Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.](https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production%20Library/22-04-2025-UN-News-Gaza.bmp/image3000x3000.jpg "Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.")

UN News

Destroyed heavy equipment, including bulldozers.

Months trapped in rubble
------------------------

The Dahdouh family managed to recover the remains of their son, Omar, from the ruins of their home, almost a year after he was killed in an airstrike which levelled their seven-story building.

Standing at the site, Omar’s brother, Moayad, shared the family’s ordeal.

“His body remained trapped under the rubble for nearly a year. After the war, we tried to retrieve him, but with the building so large and with no heavy machinery available, it was impossible.

“We searched everywhere for a bulldozer to reach the ground floor – where Omar had been – but during the war, Israeli forces destroyed or burned all the bulldozers or excavators that could have helped us.”

A decent burial
---------------

In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, the Dajani family continues to live in what’s left of their destroyed home, where the bodies of three of their children remain buried.

Their father Ali remembers the time they died with a heavy heart.

“We fled to the beach area during the bombings."

Israel levelling thousands of Gaza civilian buildings in controlled demolitions
===============================================================================

By Benedict Garman, Matt Murphy & the Visual Journalism team 18 July 2025

 !https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/raw/p0lqpcm9.jpg <image:8720>

 

**Israel has demolished thousands of buildings across Gaza since it withdrew from a ceasefire with Hamas in March, with entire towns and suburbs - once home to tens of thousands of people - levelled in the past few weeks.**  
  
Satellite images show massive amounts of destruction in several areas which Israel's military command claims to have under "operational control". Most buildings in the after image are destroyed; a maternity hospital, however, remains standing <image:8731>

Planet Labs PBC

Satellite images showed that much of the area had already been heavily damaged by Israeli bombing and artillery fire, but dozens of buildings had withstood the barrage. The image shows that most of the buildings in the settlement, the greenhouses, and most of the vegetation has been destroyed. The image shows that most of the buildings in the settlement, the greenhouses, and most of the vegetation has been destroyed. 
  
Also since early in the war analysts have suggested that Israel has been attempting to create deep "buffer zones" by destroying buildings near to the border, but some of the areas flattened recently are deep into Gaza. 
  
Large swathes of it have been caused by planned demolitions, both to already damaged buildings and ones that appeared largely intact. <image:8721>

The scale of destruction can be clearly seen in the city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt.

In recent weeks, Israeli forces and contractors have levelled large swathes of Rafah.

An analysis of damage by academics Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek found the destruction in Gaza since April has been most concentrated in the region.

Controlled explosions, excavators and bulldozers have obliterated whole areas.

In July, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz outlined plans to establish what he called a "humanitarian city" over the ruins of Rafah, with an initial 600,000 Palestinians being confined there. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the BBC that the proposal would be "interpreted as being akin to a concentration camp".

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image's geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine. The web search results confirm significant destruction in Gaza. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59)) provides satellite imagery and states that thousands of buildings have been demolished since March 2025.

The claim states the image was taken in December 2024. However, the provided evidence indicates that the destruction occurred in 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/24/israel-has-destroyed-more-than-1000-buildings-in-gaza-city-civil-defence](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/24/israel-has-destroyed-more-than-1000-buildings-in-gaza-city-civil-defence)) reported on August 24, 2025, that Israel destroyed over 1,000 buildings in Gaza City <image:i>. The UN News ([https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162491](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162491)) reported on April 22, 2025, that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed <image:k>.

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59)) published an article on July 18, 2025, discussing the destruction of buildings in Gaza, including satellite images from May 31, 2025, and July 8, 2025, and stating that Israel has demolished thousands of buildings across Gaza since March 2025 <image:8737>, <image:8720>, <image:8721>.


## Elaboration
The image's geolocation data suggests it could be in Palestine. The web search results confirm significant destruction in Gaza. The BBC article ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-33fccfbe-abcc-4af1-bdd2-632b2787cf59)) provides satellite imagery and states that thousands of buildings have been demolished since March 2025.

The claim states the image was taken in December 2024. However, the provided evidence indicates that the destruction occurred in 2025.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

But there remains a major impediment — Arab countries are not in agreement on what governance of Gaza should look like after the conflict, the official said.

When it comes to the more immediate needs in Gaza, given the horrific humanitarian situation there for Palestinians in recent months, Blinken will evaluate improvements Israel made — and steps that still need to be taken — since the administration sent a letter to Israel pressuring them to take more actions to get the aid into Gaza, the official said.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations said the United States would be “complicit” in any Israeli aggression against Iran if it emboldened Israel by providing it with advanced weaponry.

The letter also accused US President Joe Biden of making “inflammatory” remarks at a press briefing in Berlin on October 18, during which Biden said he had a good understanding of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s October 1 missile attack.

The Iranian mission said his comments signaled Washington’s “tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran.”

Hezbollah says it carried out 31 attacks against Israel and its troops in southern Lebanon, according to a group statement early Tuesday local time.

The attacks involved rockets, missiles, and drones and were carried out in support of Palestinians in Gaza and the “defense of Lebanon and its people,” the group’s statement read.

Hezbollah said it had confronted Israeli forces attempting “to advance” on the Lebanese border, and it had also conducted “operations against the sites, bases, and deployment of the Israeli enemy army and settlements in the north (of Israel.)”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that Hezbollah had on Monday fired “approximately 170 projectiles” that “crossed from Lebanon into Israel.”

Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalya to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing.

 in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital, considered the largest public hospital in Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris renewed calls for restarting the negotiations in the wake of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s killing.

US officials have had “some initial conversations,” Kirby said, with Israeli counterparts and “continue to engage in intensive diplomacy to see what can be done to try to find a path to a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.”

The US has also expressed a “strong desire to see what can be done to find a diplomatic path forward to get the hostages home,” he said.

US envoy Amos Hochstein is in Beirut Monday, Kirby noted, where he is working “to see what could be in the realm of the possible in terms of trying to find a meaningful ceasefire.”

Earlier, CNN reported that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart Monday for a [high-stakes trip to Israel and the Middle East](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2ithpdg000v3b6mdl7hlrrh)

President Joe Biden is “deeply concerned” following the [leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
 on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby.

He added: “You can rest assured that he will be actively monitoring the progress of the investigative effort to figure out how this happened, and obviously he’ll be very interested in hearing any mitigation measures and recommendations that come as a result of the investigative efforts.”

Kirby added that they do not yet know how the documents were released and that the Department of Defense is continuing their investigation.

Kirby also said that “at this time” they have no reason to believe similar documents will be released.

“We don’t have any indication at this point that there’s an expectation that there will be additional documents like this finding their way into the public domain,” he said.

Kirby also confirmed that the US has been in communication with the Israelis about the disclosure, but did not provide any details of those conversations.

**More background:** The documents, dated October 15 and 16, began circulating online Friday after being posted on Telegram by an account called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Israel, President Joe Biden’s administration is unclear about what the coming weeks will hold for the future of Hamas as well as Gaza hostage and ceasefire talks, a senior State Department official said, according to press pool.

While the US is trying to take advantage of [Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s death](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/17/middleeast/israel-hamas-leader-yahya-sinwar-gaza-intl/index.html)
 to push the Israel-Hamas conflict closer to a resolution, the group needs to figure out its leadership in order to get back to the table, the official said. “Now they are doing it in Lebanon.”

An Israeli strike near Lebanon’s biggest public hospital on Monday night was not in an area covered by evacuation orders issued by the military, a CNN analysis of the strike and maps of no-go zones has found.

Before the strike, Israel’s military issued a slew of evacuation orders for Beirut’s southern suburbs, with maps indicating specific buildings slated for targeting, along with 500-meter radius no-go zones around those targets.

The area surrounding Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which was hit in one of several Israeli airstrikes on Monday, was not included in those instructions, nor in any evacuation orders published since Israel ramped up strikes against Hezbollah last month.

The strike near the hospital killed at least four people — including a child — and caused “a lot of damage” to the hospital, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it hit a “Hezbollah terrorist target” in a strike near the hospital, insisting that the hospital itself was not hit, targeted or affected by the strike.

The Lebanese health ministry said earlier the strike killed at least four people, wounded 24 others, and caused “a lot of damage” at the hospital.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has hit thousands of Hezbollah targets since ground operations started in southern Lebanon on October 1.

The Israeli forces had “struck over 3,200 terror targets, including hundreds of weapons storage facilities, rocket launchers, anti-tank posts, terrorist infrastructure, and command-and-control centers,” the IDF said in a statement Monday.

“Of these, approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the IDF read.

The IDF also claimed it killed dozens of Hezbollah members since October 1, including “seven Hezbollah brigade commanders, 21 battalion commanders, and 24 company commanders.”

At least four people, including a child, were killed in an Israeli strike outside Rafik Hariri University Hospital on the outskirts of Beirut, the Lebanese health ministry said Monday night.

Rafik Hariri University Hospital is considered the largest public hospital in Lebanon.

Another 24 people were wounded in the strike, according to a preliminary toll from the ministry. When asked for comment by CNN, the IDF referred to Hagari’s press statement on the strike in Syria.

Israel has designated the Hezbollah-linked financial institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan as “a terrorist organization,” a day after striking several of its branches across Lebanon.

“The designation is part of a wider campaign led by Israel’s defense establishment, targeting the economic resources of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations,” Israel’s defense ministry said in a statement Monday.

The ministry said intelligence indicated Al-Qard Al-Hassan was used to finance Hezbollah’s operations “via the purchase of munitions, payment of salaries to terrorists, and storing Hezbollah funds.”

The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari accused Al-Qard Al-Hassan of violating international law, noting it had been “sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries.”

Hundreds of right-wing Israeli activists — including government ministers and members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s parliamentary coalition — attended an event Monday calling for the Israeli government to establish Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

Senior ministers who attended the event near the Gaza border included National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Minister for Social Equality and Minister for Women’s Empowerment May Golan.

While the Israeli prime minister has said Israel does not intend to settle Gaza, Golan was among several members of Netanyahu’s Likud party who participated, in addition to Ben Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and Smotrich’s Religious Zionist Party.

Calls for Israeli settlements in Gaza were accompanied by calls for the expulsion of the strip’s Palestinian population.

“As a result of the brutal massacre of the 7th of October, the Gaza Arabs lost the right to be here,” Daniella Weiss, known as the [godmother of the Zionist settler movement,](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-settlers-daniella-weiss/index.html)
 said to cheers and applause. The IDF said it hit a “[Hezbollah terrorist target](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlcyel00003b6n206rj0xb)
” near the hospital.

 and that Israel made similar allegations in Gaza before targeting medical facilities.

• Meanwhile, the UN warned [almost no aid is entering the Jabalya refugee camp](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jlkf8w000h3b6ntv25t5iw)

Philippe Lazzarini speaks during an interview in New York on September 24.

The head of the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency has accused Israel of preventing aid from reaching northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face a dire humanitarian situation amid a renewed Israeli military offensive.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini [wrote in an X post](https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1848330806084726795)
 on Monday that Israel continues “to deny humanitarian missions to reach the north \[of Gaza\] with critical supplies including medicine and food.”

UNRWA’s “remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets,” Lazzarini added, as he as he urged Israel to allow access for UN teams.

“Denying & weaponizing humanitarian assistance to achieve military purposes is a sign of how low the moral compass is,” he said. Agence France-Presse news agency footage showed large plumes of smoke rising around south Beirut’s skyline Monday night.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also [raised alarm about Israeli attacks](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2jdttub00133b6n1gsjy7ns)
 on hospitals in northern Gaza, saying “patients and medical staff must be protected. This comes as the White House said it was clear-eyed about the status of a diplomatic outcome in Gaza or Lebanon, conceding that negotiations toward a ceasefire [are not “about to restart.”](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk#cm2j90gwd00003b6nqc6a3w8s)
    
*   **US intelligence leak:** President Joe Biden said he was “deeply concerned” following [the leak of highly classified US intelligence](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/us-israel-iran-intelligence-documents/index.html)
     on Israel’s plans to attack Iran and will be “actively monitoring” the investigation, according to national security spokesperson John Kirby."

The last time Israel invaded southern Lebanon and engaged in ground combat with Hezbollah was during the month-long [2006 Lebanon War](/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War "2006 Lebanon War")
.[\[93\]](#cite_note-apnews20240930-99)

According to security expert Sobelman, Israel had spent two decades preparing for the next war with Hezbollah.[\[94\]](#cite_note-cnn20241012-100)

Shortly after the onset of the [Gaza war](/wiki/Gaza_war "Gaza war")
 in October 2023, Hezbollah joined the conflict, citing solidarity with Palestinians,[\[95\]](#cite_note-aj-101)
 which quickly escalated into regular cross-border military exchanges impacting areas in or around [northern Israel](/wiki/Northern_Israel "Northern Israel")
, [southern Lebanon](/wiki/Southern_Lebanon "Southern Lebanon")
 and the Israeli-occupied [Golan Heights](/wiki/Golan_Heights "Golan Heights")
 of [Syria](/wiki/Syria "Syria")
.[\[96\]](#cite_note-102)
 Hezbollah said it aimed to pressure Israel by forcing it to fight on two fronts.[\[88\]](#cite_note-foreignaffairs20240923-94)
 Hezbollah has offered an immediate ceasefire should [a ceasefire also happen in Gaza](/wiki/Calls_for_a_ceasefire_during_the_Gaza_war "Calls for a ceasefire during the Gaza war")
.[\[97\]](#cite_note-Hezbollah_warns-103)

 and 52 in Israel (including 27 civilians), displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon,[\[100\]](#cite_note-leb-displace-106)
 with significant damage to civilian infrastructure.[\[101\]](#cite_note-107)

Israel requested that Hezbollah implement [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701")
 (UNSCR 1701) and withdraw its forces north of the [Litani River](/wiki/Litani_River "Litani River")

 Reuters reported that, according to an unnamed Hezbollah official, 1,500 Hezbollah fighters were taken out of action due to injuries, with many blinded or having lost their hands.[\[122\]](#cite_note-128)
 Despite Israel denying involvement with the attack,[\[123\]](#cite_note-denial-129)
 unnamed Israeli sources told Reuters and other media that it was orchestrated by Israel's intelligence service ([Mossad](/wiki/Mossad "Mossad")
) and military.[\[124\]](#cite_note-130)
[\[125\]](#cite_note-nyt-fbs-trojan-24-131)
[\[118\]](#cite_note-CNN-3-124)
 In response, Hezbollah, who described the attack as a possible [declaration of war](/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war")
 by Israel, launched a rocket attack on northern Israel a few days later.[\[126\]](#cite_note-Reuters-2-132)
[\[127\]](#cite_note-133)

 Hagari also mentioned that evidence from these operations, including videos and maps, would be presented to the international community. Two hours later, the IDF fired rounds into the camp that caused smoke to rise, injuring 15 UNIFIL peacekeepers due to skin irritations and [gastrointestinal](/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract "Gastrointestinal tract")

Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon hit branches of Hezbollah-linked bank

Strikes targeted Al-Qard Al-Hassan buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley

*   [Middle East crisis – live updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/oct/21/middle-east-crisis-live-israel-strikes-beirut-idf-may-be-destroying-population-in-north-gaza-un-body-says)
    

Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan.

At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of the capital, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood. Blinken will also address improvements in humanitarian aid access to Gaza, which the US said could result in reductions in arms supplies to Israel if aid continues to be prevented from reaching the beleaguered strip.

On Monday, Israeli forces besieged hospitals and shelters for displaced people in the north of Gaza as they stepped up their operations against Palestinian militants, residents and medics said.

Before the bombings in Lebanon, Israel issued several warnings via X , pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon and warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. The Israeli military said on Sunday night that Al-Qard Al-Hasssan financed Hezbollah and the group “uses this money to finance its terrorist activities”, including buying and storing arms.

The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. Its progress is unclear, as the border areas have been virtually depopulated and media access is limited.

On Monday afternoon, Hochstein said implementation of the UN security council resolution 1701 was the path towards a ceasefire in Lebanon and rejected calls to amend the UN agreement.

Resolution 1701 ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. The resolution also dictated that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanon.

“The non-implementation of resolution 1701 is the reason for the intensification and continuation of this conflict,” Hochstein said after meeting Berri, who negotiates on behalf of Hezbollah. Lebanese officials are likely to reject the new demands, which would be seen as encroaching on the country’s sovereignty.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, including an Israeli strike near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut on October 21, 2024, which resulted in casualties. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and resulted in an Israeli victory and a ceasefire agreement.

The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) reports on Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, that hit branches of the Hezbollah-linked bank Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:35>

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) both provide evidence of these attacks.

The image itself is not directly addressed in the provided evidence. However, the evidence does confirm that Israeli attacks on Lebanon occurred on the date specified in the claim.

Without further information, it is impossible to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results confirm the occurrence of Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, they do not directly confirm that the image in the claim depicts one of these attacks. The evidence includes images from opb.org, PBS NewsHour, and NPR, but none of these images match the one in the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.

The CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-lebanon-gaza-war-10-21-24-intl-hnk)) and The Guardian article ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/21/israeli-airstrikes-on-lebanon-hit-branches-of-hezbollah-linked-bank-al-qard-al-hassan)) both provide evidence of these attacks.

The image itself is not directly addressed in the provided evidence. However, the evidence does confirm that Israeli attacks on Lebanon occurred on the date specified in the claim.

Without further information, it is impossible to verify if the image depicts the Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include images and articles about Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024. One source, opb.org, contains an image of an Israeli attack on Beirut on October 21, 2024. <image:8747> Another source, PBS NewsHour, includes an image of buildings destroyed by the attack. <image:8748> NPR reports on Israeli strikes on Hezbollah-linked banks Al-Qard Al-Hassan. <image:8749>


## Elaboration
The image search results provide additional context. While the search results confirm the occurrence of Israeli attacks on Lebanon on October 21, 2024, they do not directly confirm that the image in the claim depicts one of these attacks. The evidence includes images from opb.org, PBS NewsHour, and NPR, but none of these images match the one in the claim.

Therefore, the claim cannot be fully verified based on the available evidence.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The initial web search confirmed that Israeli attacks on Lebanon occurred on October 21, 2024. However, the image search did not provide any images that matched the one in the claim. Therefore, while the date is accurate, the specific image's connection to the event remains unverified.

The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Israeli_invasion_of_Lebanon)) discusses the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, which began on October 1, 2024, and resulted in an Israeli victory and a ceasefire agreement.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search reveals that MAHMOD HAMS has taken photos of explosions, including those related to Israeli airstrikes. One image from Getty Images ([https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/picture-shows-israeli-air-strikes-in-the-gaza-strip-news-photo/1232810997)) shows an explosion in the Gaza Strip, which is similar in style to the image in the claim.

The image in the claim is credited to MAHMOD HAMS. While the search results show that MAHMOD HAMS has photographed explosions, including those related to Israeli airstrikes, the search results do not confirm that the image in the claim depicts an Israeli attack on Lebanon on October 21, 2024.

**GAZA** – Thousands of displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza have sought refuge in one of the territory’s largest soccer arenas, where families now scrape by with little food or water as they try to keep one step ahead of Israel's [latest offensive](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-07-02-2024-7ea786c949342f6c292984a926bf7620)

They’ve been displaced multiple times, she said, most recently from Israel’s renewed operations against Hamas in the Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City.

“We woke up and found tanks in front of the door,” she says. Not even food.”

She fled with a group of 70 other people to Yarmouk Sports Stadium — a little under 2 miles (3 kilometers) northwest of Shijaiyah, which was heavily bombed and largely emptied [early in the war](https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-israel-bombing-destruction-hamas-reconstruction-f299a28410b70ee05dd764df97d8d3a0)
. “We didn't take anything with us, not a mattress, not a pillow, not any clothes, not a thing. Many of the people who ended up in the stadium say they have nothing to return to.

*   Mocking posts by Israeli soldiers going viral
*   Some experts say posts may breach international law

March 28 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers have been posting photos and videos of themselves toying with lingerie found in Palestinian homes, creating a dissonant visual record of the [war in Gaza](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 as a looming [famine](/world/middle-east/destruction-lawlessness-red-tape-hobble-aid-gazans-go-hungry-2024-03-25/)
 intensifies world scrutiny of Israel's offensive.

In one video, an Israeli soldier sits in an armchair in a room in Gaza grinning, with a gun in one hand and dangling white satin underwear from the other over the open mouth of a comrade lying on a sofa.

Elsewhere, another soldier sits atop a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet and says: "I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman."

The two videos shot by Israeli soldiers are among dozens of posts in which troops in Gaza are shown displaying lingerie, mannequins, and in some cases both. Instagram did not comment.

Israel's military campaign in Gaza was launched in response to an attack on Israel by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Oct. By contrast, he said, posts showing weapons or Hamas flags said to have been found in Gazan homes have been circulating widely.

    August 29, 2025 The lingerie images have been viewed tens of thousands of times - nearly half a million in one case - after being reposted by Younis Tirawi, who describes himself as a Palestinian reporter.

Approached about images he reposted to his more than 100,000 followers on X between Feb. Reuters then independently verified eight posted on Instagram or YouTube.

"The posting of such images is demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women," said Ravina Shamdasani, U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson.

Reuters sent details of the eight verified posts on YouTube or Instagram to the Israel Defense Forces, requesting comment.

In response, a spokesperson sent a statement saying the IDF investigates incidents that deviate from the orders and expected values of IDF soldiers, as well as reports of videos uploaded to social networks.

"In cases where suspicion of a criminal offense arises that justifies opening an investigation, an investigation is opened by the Military Police," it said.

"It should be clarified that in some of the examined cases, it is concluded that the expression or behaviour of the soldiers in the video is inappropriate, and it is handled accordingly," the statement said.

The IDF declined to say whether it was referring to any of the images highlighted by Reuters, or whether any of the soldiers responsible have been disciplined.

The Israeli soldiers whom Reuters was able to identify did not respond to requests for comment sent via their social media accounts.

From [Source](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461): 
Content: "Around a third of the approximately 100 international staff working in Gaza will be temporarily relocated.

After cutting off all humanitarian aid into Gaza for three weeks – the longest suspension since 7 October 2023 – Israeli officials have indicated that they intend to continue their military campaign across Gaza and annex territory to pressure Hamas.

**Strike on UN compound from ‘Israeli tank’**
---------------------------------------------

The UN Spokesperson said that based on currently available information**, “**[**the strikes hitting a UN compound**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161261)
 **in Deir Al Balah on 19 March were caused by an Israeli tank.”**.

In the aftermath of Wednesday’s strike, Israel said it had not been behind the blast.

“The strikes claimed the life of a UN colleague from Bulgaria and left six others – from France, Moldova, North Macedonia, Palestine and the United Kingdom – with severe injuries, some of them life-altering,” Monday’s statement continued.

The location of the compound was well known to all the parties to the conflict.

“I reiterate that all parties to the conflict are bound by international law to protect the absolute inviolability of UN premises,” the statement from Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric continued.

“Without this, our colleagues face intolerable risks as they work to save the lives of civilians.”

The Secretary-General is demanding a full, thorough and independent investigation into Wednesday’s deadly strike, protection of all civilian life in the renewed fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas and the resumption of aid deliveries.

Furthermore, all hostages “must be released immediately and unconditionally”.

**‘Relentless bombardment’ again**
----------------------------------

One week since Israeli bombing started again in Gaza, UN humanitarians have described deadly attacks hitting health workers, ambulances and hospitals.

Senior UN humanitarian in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Jonathan Whittall, said that hundreds of children and adults have been killed since the ceasefire broke down between Hamas and Israel.

The UN agency for Palestine refugees, [UNRWA](https://www.unrwa.org/)
, also said on Monday that 124,000 people in the enclave have been forced to flee what it called “relentless bombardment”.

“**Families carry what little they have with no shelter, no safety, and nowhere left to go**; the Israeli authorities have cut off all aid,” UNRWA said in an online statement – warning that food is scarce and prices are soaring as the Israeli blockade continues.

Relief chief Tom Fletcher tweeted that he was continuing to receive horrific reports from Gaza of more health workers, ambulances and hospitals attacked as they try to save survivors. [Skip to main content / navigation](#main-content)

Guterres to reduce UN aid ‘footprint’ inside Gaza following ceasefire collapse
==============================================================================

24 March 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

The [UN Secretary-General](https://www.un.org/sg/en)
 on Monday took the “difficult decision” to reduce the aid operation inside the Gaza Strip following the resumption of deadly Israeli airstrikes – but pledged that “the UN is not leaving” the enclave.

"In the past week, Israel carried out devastating strikes on Gaza, claiming the lives of hundreds of civilians, including United Nations personnel, with no humanitarian aid being allowed to enter the Strip since early March,” [said a statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note-correspondents/2025-03-24/note-correspondents-gaza)
 released by his Spokesperson.

“As a result, **the Secretary-General has taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization’s footprint in Gaza, even as humanitarian needs soar** and our concern over the protection of civilians intensifies.”

The UN stressed that it remained fully committed to providing lifesaving aid. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said four of its ambulances were targeted, as well as 10 team members carrying out humanitarian work.

“Communication with the team has been completely lost for 30 hours, and at this point, their fate remains unknown,” the UN Spokesperson continued.

**Call for additional emergency teams**
---------------------------------------

As hostilities continue across Gaza, aid coordination office, [OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)
, and partners called for the entry of additional emergency medical teams into Gaza to help health workers already on the ground who are “exhausted and, of course, overwhelmed.”

Israeli authorities on Sunday issued a new evacuation order in Rafah, covering around two per cent of the Strip and affecting five neighbourhoods.

“With this latest directive, the overall area designated for evacuation over the past week covers an estimated 14 per cent of the Gaza Strip – along  with vast 'no go' zones along the borders and the Netzarim corridor,” Mr. Fletcher said we all must demand that hospitals and medics must not be targeted.

In southern Gaza on Sunday, several casualties were reported after the surgical department of Nasser Medical Complex was hit and caught fire, Mr. Dujarric told journalists in New York at the daily briefing.

In Rafah, ambulances were reportedly hit in Tal Al Sultan, resulting in several casualties. Dujarric said.

Military targets key humanitarian hub that was relatively unscathed by war after ordering Palestinians to leave

Israel has launched substantial air raids and a ground operation in Gaza, targeting Deir al-Balah, the main hub for humanitarian efforts in the devastated Palestinian territory, amid urgent warnings of widening starvation in the coastal strip.

The latest assault comes a day after the highest death toll in 21 months inflicted by the Israeli military on [desperate Palestinians seeking food aid](http://theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/20/pope-condemns-barbarity-of-israel-war-gaza)
, with at least 85 killed on Sunday in what has become an almost daily slaughter.

Witnesses described massive airstrikes overnight in Deir al-Balah, the last remaining area of [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza)
 that has not suffered significant war damage and which is packed with Palestinians displaced from elsewhere in Gaza.

Tank shelling in the area hit houses and mosques, killing at least three Palestinians and wounding several others, local medics said, while the World Health Organization said [its buildings had been attacked](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/21/who-says-residence-and-main-warehouse-in-gaza-hit-by-israeli-forces)
.

In its daily update, Gaza’s health ministry said at least 130 Palestinians had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded by Israeli gunfire and military strikes across the territory in the past 24 hours, one of the highest such totals in recent weeks.

Early on Tuesday health authorities said at least 12 Palestinians were killed and dozens injured when Israeli tanks fired on tents housing displaced people at al-Shati camp in western Gaza City. <image:8862>[View image in fullscreen](#img-2)

Mourners attend the funeral of relatives killed in an Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah on Monday. It said initial findings suggested the reported casualty figures were inflated, and that it “certainly does not intentionally target humanitarian aid trucks”.

The latest Israeli attacks in Gaza took place as a security official for Yemen’s Houthi group said Israel had struck Hodeidah port on Monday, destroying a dock that had been rebuilt after it was damaged in earlier attacks.

“The bombing destroyed the port’s dock, which had been rebuilt following previous strikes,” the official told Agence France-Presse, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

The latest Israeli assault followed forced evacuation orders for between 50,000 and 80,000 people in Deir al-Balah, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, leaving almost 88% of the territory under such orders.

“With this latest order, the area of Gaza under displacement orders or within Israeli-militarised zones has risen to 87.8%, leaving 2.1 million civilians squeezed into a fragmented 12% of the strip, where essential services have collapsed,” the UN said in a statement released by its Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha).

With the growing threat of widespread starvation, Ocha emphasised the importance of Deir al-Balah for what remained of the struggling international aid effort. “Any damage to this infrastructure will have life-threatening consequences,” the agency added.

Amid increasing concern over the potential impact of the latest assaults, Ocha said the agency’s local head in Gaza, Jonathan Whittall, had decided to remain in Deir al-Balah.

!An injured man is brought to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City after Israeli forces opened fire on civilians who were waiting for humanitarian aid near Gaza City on Sunday. Lift the siege and let aid in safely and at scale,” it said.

The Israeli military said it had not entered the districts of Deir al-Balah subject to the evacuation order during the current conflict and that it was continuing “to operate with great force to destroy the enemy’s capabilities and terrorist infrastructure in the area”.

Deep concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza was underlined by reports from doctors that more than a dozen Palestinians had died from hunger in the past 24 hours.

“Nineteen people, including children, have died of hunger,” Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah told the BBC. [Skip to main content](#maincontent)

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted by Israeli attacks in March 2025. The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)) <image:188> The BBC News website contains an image of a destroyed building in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo)) <image:189>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted by Israeli attacks in March 2025. The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming bombing in Gaza after failed negotiations. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations)) <image:187>

Al Jazeera published an image of destruction in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)) <image:188> The BBC News website contains an image of a destroyed building in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo)) <image:189>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted by Israeli attacks in March 2025. The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence provides additional images related to the bombing in Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the image to the March 2025 attacks and the number of casualties.

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of an explosion in Deir al-Balah (<image:8868>). CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, including an image of smoke rising over the city (<image:8869>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming strikes in Gaza, including an image of destruction (<image:8870>).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional images related to the bombing in Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the image to the March 2025 attacks and the number of casualties.

UN staff member killed in central Gaza blast, five others injured
=================================================================

19 March 2025 [Peace and Security](/en/news/topic/peace-and-security)

At least one UN staffer has been killed and at least five others injured – several very severely – following an explosion at two UN guesthouses in Deir al Balah in the central Gaza Strip on Wednesday.

The UN is verifying and confirming the details, including the circumstances that led up to the incident at the compound,, but **it was not due to “any action” that was being taken by UN personnel to remove “unexploded ordinance”**, the head of the [UN Office for Project Services](https://www.unops.org/)
 (UNOPS) [said](https://www.unops.org/news-and-stories/speeches/statement-on-unops-colleague-killed-at-unops-premises-in-gaza)
 during a press conference in Brussels.

According to media reports, the Israeli military – which has resumed deadly strikes in the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds since Monday – has denied attacking the compound.

“**These premises were well known by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and they were ‘deconflicted’**,” said, UNOPS chief Jorge Moreira da Silva, explaining that “**everyone knew who was working inside the premises – it was UN personnel, UNOPS personnel**.”

No accident
-----------

“This was not an accident, this was an incident,” he told journalists, adding that additional information is being collected.

“**What we do know is that an explosive ordnance was dropped or fired at the infrastructure and detonated inside the building**,” he said, adding it was unclear if it had been due to air-drop weapons, artillery or rocket fire.

Mr. da Silva said.

The UN buildings are situated in an “isolated area” in Dier al Balah.

Evacuating the injured
----------------------

As investigations continue into the incident, the “top priority” is the evacuation of injured staff members, Mr. Their efforts include delivering essential supplies such as fuel and assisting in demining and explosive removal.

Additionally, the agency manages the so-called UN 2720 Mechanism for Gaza, which was [mandated](https://docs.un.org/en/s/res/2720(2023))
 by the [Security Council](https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/)
 to accelerate humanitarian aid into the enclave.

UN chief condemns attacks
-------------------------

Tweet URL

[Secretary-General António Guterres](https://www.un.org/sg/)
 reaffirmed that all parties to the conflict have a legal obligation to protect UN premises, which must remain absolutely inviolable.

In a [statement](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2025-03-19/statement-attributable-the-spokesperson-for-the-secretary-general-%E2%80%93-gaza)
 issued by his spokesperson, the UN chief strongly condemned the attacks and called for a full investigation.

“**Today’s deadly strike brings the number of UN colleagues killed in Gaza since 7 October 2023 to at least 280**,” the statement noted.

Mr. The hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally,” said the statement.

“UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides. **The civilian population relies on the UN for lifesaving assistance, they are an essential lifeline at the time of utter tragedy and devastation**,” he said.

Previous attacks
----------------

The incident took place at around 11:30 AM local time on Wednesday. da Silva said.

“We have stayed and delivered for the people in Gaza in the last year and a half. This was not the first time a first colleague from UNOPS lost their life,” he added, noting that a staffer who drove aid trucks was killed around a year ago in the line of duty.

“**It is very difficult to operate in Gaza…we have been challenged by the fact that international humanitarian law has not been respected**,” he said.

UNOPS teams in Gaza have been carrying out critical humanitarian work, supporting hundreds of thousands of civilians severely affected by the conflict. Guterres emphasised that all military operations must respect and prioritise civilian protection.

“**The Secretary-General stresses the need for the ceasefire to be respected to bring an end to the suffering of the people**."

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:39>)
web_search("Israeli bombardment Deir al-Balah March 2025")
image_search("Deir al-Balah bombing March 2025")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Jordan': 0.25, 'United Arab Emirates': 0.16, 'Palestine': 0.15, 'Malta': 0.12, 'Tunisia': 0.09, 'Israel': 0.08, 'Pakistan': 0.03, 'Turkey': 0.02, 'Guatemala': 0.01, 'Italy': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah, in March and July 2025. According to a Wikipedia article, the March attacks, which began on March 18, 2025, resulted in over 591 deaths and 1,042 injuries, with Deir al-Balah being one of the targeted locations. The UN News reported on March 24, 2025, that strikes on a UN compound in Deir Al Balah on March 19, 2025, caused casualties.

The Guardian reported on July 21, 2025, about an Israeli air and ground offensive on Deir al-Balah, which included tank shelling, resulting in casualties. The article includes an image of smoke rising over western Deir al-Balah <image:8861>. The Wikipedia article can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip). The UN News article can be found here: [https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161461). The Guardian article can be found here: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/21/israel-launches-air-ground-offensive-deir-al-balah-central-gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/21/israel-launches-air-ground-offensive-deir-al-balah-central-gaza).


### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming bombing in Gaza after failed negotiations. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations)) <image:187>

Al Jazeera published an image of destruction in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)) <image:188> The BBC News website contains an image of a destroyed building in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo)) <image:189>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted by Israeli attacks in March 2025. The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.


## Actions

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of an explosion in Deir al-Balah (<image:8868>). CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, including an image of smoke rising over the city (<image:8869>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming strikes in Gaza, including an image of destruction (<image:8870>).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional images related to the bombing in Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the image to the March 2025 attacks and the number of casualties.

The Wikipedia article can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip).

### Evidence from `image_search`
PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming bombing in Gaza after failed negotiations. ([https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/classroom/daily-news-lessons/2025/03/israel-resumes-bombing-in-gaza-after-failed-negotiations)) <image:187>

Al Jazeera published an image of destruction in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/3/18/live-trump-threatens-iran-as-deadly-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-continue)) <image:188> The BBC News website contains an image of a destroyed building in Deir al-Balah. ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmyrezyvyo)) <image:189>


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Deir al-Balah was targeted by Israeli attacks in March 2025. The web search results mention attacks in March and July 2025, with the March attacks resulting in numerous casualties. The image search results also show destruction in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the image in the claim depicts the March 2025 attacks or the number of casualties.

The geolocation data suggests that the image was most likely taken in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, or Palestine.

Therefore, while the claim is partially supported by the evidence, it lacks specific information to confirm the exact date and the number of casualties depicted in the image. More information is needed to verify the claim fully.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The Guardian published an image of an explosion in Deir al-Balah (<image:8868>). CNN published an article on July 21, 2025, about Israeli military activity in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, including an image of smoke rising over the city (<image:8869>). PBS NewsHour published an article about Israel resuming strikes in Gaza, including an image of destruction (<image:8870>).


## Elaboration
The new evidence provides additional images related to the bombing in Deir al-Balah. However, none of the images match the one in the claim. The evidence confirms that there were Israeli attacks in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, but it does not provide any information about the specific image in the claim.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of evidence directly linking the image to the March 2025 attacks and the number of casualties.

An Israeli tank moves a long the border with the Gaza Strip on January 1, 2025 in Southern Israel, Israel. One user wrote, “The Merkava tank is the most famous Israeli military industry. In Gaza, they made it into a Gazan fruit and vegetable stall. It also identifies the location as Homs, not Damascus.

“The army left a tank… for almost three days, I brought the goods, but no one saw the shop,” Youssef says in the video.

Furthermore, the tank is a [T-54/55](https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/WEG/Asset/T-54_Russian_Main_Battle_Tank_(MBT)
), not a Merkava tank. A Merkava tank has a [flatter turret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkava)
 than the Soviet-era tank, which was [widely used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Syrian_Army)
 by the Syrian Arab Army.

### Second Intifada

In February 2002, a Merkava III was destroyed by a roadside bomb near [Netzarim](/wiki/Netzarim "Netzarim")
 in the Gaza Strip. The IDF wanted to increase orders of new Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and planned to add the [Trophy active defense system](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 to Merkava Mark 4 tanks, and to increase joint training between crews and Israeli [anti-tank](/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare "Anti-tank warfare")
 soldiers.[\[58\]](#cite_note-58)
[\[59\]](#cite_note-59)

### Operation Cast Lead

Main article: [Operation Cast Lead](/wiki/Operation_Cast_Lead "Operation Cast Lead")

The Merkava Mark IV was used more extensively during the [Gaza War](/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008%E2%80%932009) "Gaza War (2008–2009)")
, as it had been received by the IDF in increasing numbers since 2006, replacing more of the Merkava II and III versions of the tank that were in service. The Trophy protective system has been used by the IDF since 2011.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg/250px-Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)](/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Israel_Defense_Forces_-_Storming_Ahead.jpg)

Merkava IV equipped with the [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 active defense system.

By October 2010, the IDF had begun to equip the first Merkava Mark IVs with the Trophy active protection system, to improve the tanks' protection against advanced anti-tank missiles which use [tandem-charge](/wiki/Tandem-charge "Tandem-charge")
 HEAT warheads.[\[62\]](#cite_note-62)
[\[63\]](#cite_note-weiss-63)
 Added protection systems included an Elbit laser-warning system and IMI in-built smoke-screen grenades.[\[29\]](#cite_note-Merkava_Mk_IV_breaks_cover-29)

In December 2010, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 fired an [AT-14 Kornet](/wiki/AT-14_Kornet "AT-14 Kornet")
 anti-tank missile at a Merkava Mark 3 tank stationed on the Israel-Gaza border near Al-[Bureij](/wiki/Bureij "Bureij")
. As a result of the attack, Israel decided to deploy its first Merkava Mark 4 battalion equipped with the Trophy system along the Gaza border.[\[64\]](#cite_note-64)

On March 1, 2011, a Merkava Mark IV stationed near the Gaza border, equipped with the Trophy active protection system, successfully foiled a missile attack against it, marking the system's first operational success.[\[65\]](#cite_note-65)

### Operation Protective Edge 2014

Main article: [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/Operation_Protective_Edge "Operation Protective Edge")

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg/250px-Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)](/wiki/File:Merkava4m-Windbreaker-0036a.jpg)

Merkava Mk 4M Windbreaker, fitted with [Trophy](/wiki/Trophy_(countermeasure) "Trophy (countermeasure)")
 [active protection system](/wiki/Active_protection_system "Active protection system")
, during [Operation Protective Edge](/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict "2014 Israel–Gaza conflict")

No tanks were damaged during Operation Protective Edge. _(May 2024)_ _([Learn how and when to remove this message](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal "Help:Maintenance template removal")<br>)_ |

Some Merkava tanks are fitted with full medical and ambulance abilities while retaining their armament (but carrying less ammunition than the standard tank, having both ammunition racks in the rear removed). The Loader Keyboard Panel (LKP) includes breech block closing switch, fire and local activation of the trays.

The main operational roles are: firing from internal storage; firing for elevator – ground-piled ammunition; loading from elevator – external pile; synthesising fire programs; unloading; manual firing; identification; and fusing and checks.

Standard equipment includes an NBC system of the overpressure type and an inertial navigation and aiming system designed for autonomous operations.

According to Soltam Systems, the 155 mm/52 caliber ordnance and automatic loader, or parts of the system, could be installed in other self-propelled artillery systems and used to upgrade other self-propelled systems such as the US-designed and built 155 mm [M109](/wiki/M109_howitzer "M109 howitzer")
 and [M44](/wiki/M44_self_propelled_howitzer "M44 self propelled howitzer")
.

Successor (Carmel)
------------------

On July 14, 2011, _[The Jerusalem Post](/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post "The Jerusalem Post")
_ reported that the IDF had begun developing a successor for the Merkava series of tanks. With the system's ability to intercept threats at a stand-off distance, there was a review of the need for vehicles like the Merkava to have thick, heavy layers of armor.[\[82\]](#cite_note-82)

The Merkava Tank Planning Directorate set up a team to study principles for a future tank and present ideas for an armored fighting vehicle to provide mobile firepower on a future battlefield. [Jump to content](#bodyContent)

Hamas's anti-tank flyer.

Via social media

Hamas terrorists think they know how to knock out the Israeli army’s main tank, the 70-ton Merkava Mark IV.

Aim for the rear hatch and ammunition-stowage, the space between the turret and hull, the tank’s belly or a supposed weak spot in the armor on the side of the hull near the front. The ammo storage, turret ring and belly are weak spots on virtually _all_ tanks.

What’s more surprising is Hamas’ tips for defeating the Trophy active protective systems that are new features on some of the Israeli army’s roughly 400 front-line Merkava Mark IVs. Alternatively, an SPG-9 recoilless gun should defeat a Trophy-equipped tank, simply by virtue of its projectile’s high speed.

There is some evidence of Hamas militants damaging a Merkava with an PG-7T rocket on Oct. It’s possible the terrorists dutifully followed the flyer’s advice; it’s _also_ possible they defeated the tank’s Trophy by firing several rounds in quick succession—and overwhelming the device.

In any event, it wasn’t RPG teams who claimed the most Merkavas on Oct. Hamas’ small drones [struck at least two](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israels-merkava-mark-iv-tanks-are-more-drone-proof-than-other-tanks-are/?sh=172138352114")
 of the heavily-armed, thickly-armored tanks. Another hit a Merkava on the turret bustle, which holds spare 120-millimeter cannon rounds for the four-person crew.

And the militants also _captured_ a Merkava—[along with more than a dozen superheavy armored personnel carriers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2023/10/12/israel-converted-captured-arab-t-55-tanks-into-heavy-personnel-carriers-hamas-just-captured-a-tenth-of-them/?sh=60c212994a84")
—at an Israeli army base in Nakhal Oz. The terrorists abducted hundreds more people in settlements near the Israeli wall surrounding Gaza.

The Israelis retrieved at least one of the flyers, apparently from a dead Hamas fighter, and posted photos on social media.

The flyer’s contents should come as no surprise to experienced soldiers. One aimed its payload at the thin armor protecting the tank’s engine in its forward hull. You don’t need help from a flyer when a tank is crewless and idle.

A view of damaged Syrian General Staff Headquarters following multiple Israeli air strikes in central Damascus, Syria, on July 16, 2025 \[Abdulkarem Al-Mohammad/Anadolu\]

Published On 16 Jul 202516 Jul 2025

Israel has carried out powerful [air strikes](/news/2025/7/16/why-did-israel-bomb-syria-a-look-at-the-druze-and-the-violence-in-suwayda)
 near Syria’s presidential palace and on the military headquarters in the heart of Damascus, a major escalation in its bombardment of the neighbouring country.

At least three people were killed and 34 others were wounded in the [attacks on Damascus](/video/newsfeed/2025/7/16/israel-targets-syrian-government-with-attack-on-damascus-military-hq)
 on Wednesday, Syrian state media reported, citing the Ministry of Health.

While targeting Damascus, the Israeli military continued to pound areas in southern Syria, including [Suwayda](/news/2025/7/16/sectarian-tension-israeli-intervention-what-led-violence-syria)
, where a new ceasefire deal has been struck after four days of clashes between Druze armed groups, Bedouin tribes and government forces, which left hundreds dead.

Syria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Israeli attacks on Damascus and Suwayda were “part of a systematic Israeli policy to ignite tension and chaos and undermine security in Syria”, calling on the international community to take “urgent action” against Israeli aggression.

Israel said its bombing campaign is aimed at protecting the Druze minority, and it has called on the Syrian government to withdraw its troops from the city of Suwayda, where much of the violence has taken place.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said on X that the Israeli military would “continue to operate vigorously in Suwayda to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely”.

Later on Wednesday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the parties to the fighting in southern Syria had agreed on “specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight”.

“This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X of the ceasefire deal, reached one day after an earlier iteration had collapsed.

More than 300 people had been killed in fighting as of Wednesday morning, including four children, eight women and 165 soldiers and security forces, according to the UK-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Army withdrawal from Suwayda
----------------------------

The Syrian Ministry of Interior and Druze leader Sheikh Yousef Jarbou confirmed on Wednesday that they had reached a ceasefire. But the new deal was rejected by Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajari, another Druze leader, who promised to continue fighting until Suwayda was “entirely liberated”.

According to the ministry, the deal declares a “total and immediate halt to all military operations”, as well as the formation of a committee comprising government officials and Druze spiritual leaders to supervise its implementation.

That evening, the Syrian Ministry of Defence said it had begun withdrawing the army from Suwayda “in implementation of the terms of the adopted agreement after the end of the sweep of the city for outlaw groups”.

Speaking shortly before Rubio’s announcement of a deal, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce had said that the US wanted Syrian government forces to “withdraw their military in order to enable all sides to de-escalate and find a path forward”.

But while Syrian troops are withdrawing, the government will be maintaining a presence in the city,

Reporting from Syria’s capital Damascus, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said the deal included the “deployment of government forces”.

“They will set up checkpoints, and this area will be fully integrated into the Syrian state,” she said.

A complete withdrawal by the government would, she said, “mean a failure in efforts by the new authorities to unite a fractured nation and extend its authority across Syria”.

“But staying could open a much bigger conflict with Israel that has promised more strikes if, in the words of Katz, the message wasn’t received.”

Pretext to bomb
---------------

The escalation in Syria began with tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks between Druze armed factions and local Sunni Bedouin tribes in the southern province of Suwayda.

Government forces that intervened to restore order clashed with the Druze, with reports of the former carrying out human rights abuses, according to local monitors and analysts.

The actions committed by members of the security forces – acknowledged as “unlawful criminal acts” by the Syrian presidency – have given Israel a pretext to bombard Syria as it builds [military bases](/news/2025/2/3/satellite-images-show-israel-building-military-bases-in-syria-buffer-zone)
 in the demilitarised buffer zone with Syria seized by its forces.

Haid Haid, consulting fellow at London-based think tank Chatham House, told Al Jazeera that Israel had been clear since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad last year that they did not want Syrian forces “to be deployed to the deconfliction line in southern Syria”.

“One way Israel is trying to advance that plan is to present itself as the ‘protectors’ of the Druze community,” Haid said.

Ammar Kahf, the Damascus-based executive director of the Omran Center for Strategic Studies, said: “It’s a clear message to the Syrian government that the Israelis are not going to be silent.

“The Israelis are not going to allow the Syrian government to spread its authority all over the territory.”

CNN  — 

Syria says it is withdrawing troops from a flashpoint southern city after days of deadly clashes with an [Arab minority group](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/middleeast/israel-strikes-syria-sectarian-clashes-druze-intl)
 that triggered military action from Israel.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the country was “not afraid of war” but had chosen to put its people “above chaos and destruction,” after his government announced a new ceasefire with the Druze, an offshoot of Islam whose followers are spread across Syria, Israel and Lebanon.

The truce followed intervention from the US as well as Israeli strikes on the Syrian capital Damascus, with Israel saying it was acting to protect the Druze.

So far, the ceasefire appears to be holding, but it is unclear whether it will last. They are made up of a network of groups with multiple figureheads.

In Syria, the Druze community is concentrated around three main provinces close to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in the south of the country, and form a majority in the Suwayda province.

More than 20,000 Druze also live in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, before formally annexing it in 1981.

Hundreds of Druze crossed from Israel into Syria this week, apparently responding to pleas from Druze leaders to support their community in the ongoing clashes.

While Israel says its efforts aim to protect Syria’s Druze the country has also been alarmed by the Syrian government and has been trying to shore up its borders by expanding its military footprint in the country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously referred to the new leaders of the country as an “extremist Islamic regime” and a threat to Israel.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed alarm over the continued escalation of violence in Suwayda, also condemning “Israel’s escalatory airstrikes on Suwayda, Daraa and in the center of Damascus,” and calling for “an immediate cessation of all violations of Syria’s sovereignty.”

At least 169 people have been killed, and 200 others injured during several days of clashes in the south, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said on Wednesday. A previous deal collapsed within hours, and a prominent Druze leader has rejected the new truce.

In a televised address to the nation early Thursday, Sharaa said the Syria was faced with two options: either “an open war” with Israel “at the cost of our Druze citizens,” or allowing Druze clerics “to return to reason and prioritize the national interest.”

He vowed to protect the rights of the Druze, many of whom are leery of Syria’s new rulers, who toppled the previous administration in an Islamist-led insurgency.

Syria said on Wednesday night local time its army started withdrawing from Suwayda, where clashes erupted over the weekend between Druze militia and Bedouin tribes, prompting government forces to intervene. Video on Syrian TV purportedly showed a convoy of military vehicles driving out of Suwayda city.

Israel’s airstrikes on Damascus targeted several government buildings Wednesday, with authorities saying at least three people were killed. One video from a Syrian television channel showed the Ministry of Defense building being hit live on air, forcing the anchor to take cover.

In his address, al-Sharaa accused Israel of trying to divide the Syrian people.

“The Israeli entity, known for its repeated attempts to destabilize us and sow division, once again seeks to turn our land into a battlefield of chaos and to dismantle the fabric of our people,” he said.

Israel has stepped up strikes against Syria despite pressure from the US, which has made moves to end the country’s international isolation following the rebel takeover.

US steps in
-----------

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Wednesday said the Trump administration had engaged with all parties of the conflict to end the clashes in Syria.

“We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight. This will require all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made and this is what we fully expect them to do,” Rubio said on X.

Rubio also described the latest tension between Israel and Syria as a “misunderstanding.”

A statement published by the Syrian government said that, under the new ceasefire, there will be a complete halt to military operations, a monitoring committee will be formed with the Druze leaders and members of the community will be leading security in the province.

A Druze spiritual leader representing one of the factions in Suwayda, Youssef Jarbou, confirmed an agreement was reached for a “complete and immediate halt to all military operations and de-escalation from all sides, with the army returning to its barracks.”

However, Hikmat al-Hijri – another leading Druze figure who had asked for international protection on Wednesday – rejected the ceasefire, calling on his supporters to continue fighting, raising doubts over the truce’s longevity.

The Druze, an Arab sect of roughly one million people, practice an offshoot of Islam which permits no converts – either to or from the religion – and no intermarriage."

US says 'specific steps' agreed to end Syria violence after Israeli strikes hit Damascus

Watch: How a day of bombing unfolded in Damascus

Israel's military struck the Syrian defence ministry in Damascus and government forces in southern Syria for a third day on Wednesday, as deadly sectarian fighting in the mostly Druze province of Suweida continued.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was "working to save our Druze brothers". Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa accused Israel of causing a "large-scale escalation".

More than 350 people are reported to have been killed since Sunday, when clashes between Druze militias and Bedouin tribes erupted in Suweida.

The Syrian military reportedly began to withdraw its forces from Suweida late on Wednesday, as the US said it had agreed "steps" to end the violence.

"We have agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end tonight," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.

Syria's state news agency, Sana, reported that troops were leaving Suweida as part of an agreement between the government and the Suweida's religious leaders, following the "completion of the army's pursuit of outlaw groups".

The Syrian foreign ministry said the country "welcomes the efforts made by the US and Arabian sides" to "resolve the current crisis" peacefully.

Israel has not yet commented on the ceasefire efforts.

The Israeli military began striking Syrian security forces and their weapons on Monday, after they were deployed to the city of Suweida for the first time since Sunni Islamist-led rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in December.

! Netanyahu urged those with Israeli citizenship to "return to your homes and let the \[Israeli military\] take action".

Israel said the significant escalation of its bombing campaign was aimed at making the Syrian government immediately withdraw its forces from Suweida province.

Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Wednesday afternoon that "the warnings in Damascus" had ended and that the Israeli military would "continue to operate vigorously in Suweida to destroy the forces that attacked the Druze until they withdraw completely".

He later posted that "the painful blows have begun", above a video clip showing a TV presenter diving under a desk live on camera as an Israeli air strike hit the nearby entrance to the Syrian defence ministry in Umayyad Square, in central Damascus – where huge crowds celebrated Assad's downfall last year.

A separate strike on what the Israeli military called a "military target in the area" of the presidential palace underscored the severity of Israel's warning to Sharaa.

Fadi Al Halabi, a London-based Syrian filmmaker who is visiting Damascus, said he was nearby when he heard the Israeli fighter jets approach.

"People's faces were so afraid. Suddenly the air strike\[s\] began, targeting some of the most crowded areas, including the ministry of defence," he told the BBC.

The Israeli military said it also struck armoured vehicles loaded with heavy machine guns and weapons on their way to Suweida, and firing posts and weapons storage facilities in southern Syria.

Syria's foreign ministry said the strikes targeted government institutions and civilian facilities in Damascus and Suweida and killed "several innocent civilians".

"This flagrant assault, which forms part of a deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli entity to inflame tensions, spread chaos, and undermine security and stability in Syria, constitutes a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law," it added.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that the humanitarian situation in Suweida city had rapidly deteriorated.

It cited sources as saying there were clashes in several area of the city and that tanks had attacked the national hospital, causing panic among the scores of casualties from the fighting being treated there. <image:314>!A BBC map showing Syria, Israel, the occupied Golan Heights and Suweida city <image:315>

Minority groups including the Druze - whose religion is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs - are suspicious of Sharaa and his government, despite his pledges to protect them.

Their fears have been heightened by several outbreaks of sectarian violence over the past eight months, including one in May in which dozens of people were reportedly killed in clashes between Druze, security forces, and allied Islamist fighters in Damascus and Suweida.

In the wake of that fighting, the government reached an agreement with Druze militias to hire local security forces in Suweida province from their ranks. The continued control of Suweida by the militias sparked tensions with Bedouin tribes backed by the government.

Netanyahu has said he is committed to preventing harm to the Druze in Syria because of their deep ties to those living in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The Syrian interior ministry said a ceasefire had been agreed on Wednesday night to end the fighting in Suweida city

The fighting between Bedouin tribes and Druze militias in Suweida is said to have been sparked by the abduction of a Druze merchant on the highway to Damascus last Friday.

On Sunday, armed Druze fighters reportedly encircled and later seized a neighbourhood of Suweida city that is inhabited by Bedouin. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN and UK, but no longer by the US.

The Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets since the fall of the Assad regime.

And it has sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon.

* * * They also said there were acute shortages of water and medical supplies.

Later, the Syrian health ministry said government forces had entered the hospital and found "dozens of bodies" after "outlaw groups withdrew", according to the official Sana news agency.

A man named Hosam told the BBC he was in the centre of Suweida city and had witnessed civilians coming under fire from artillery and snipers.

"I lost my neighbour today on the street. We tried to \[get an\] ambulance \[to take\] him to hospital, but we couldn't," he said.

Other witnesses and local activists have described scenes of looting and extrajudicial killings.

The SOHR says more than 350 people have been killed since Sunday in Suweida province.

They include 79 Druze fighters and 55 civilians, 27 of whom were summarily killed by interior ministry and defence ministry forces, according to the group.

At least 189 members of the government forces and 18 Bedouin tribal fighters have also been killed in the clashes, it says.

It was not immediately possible to verify the SOHR's casualty figures, but Syrian security sources also told the BBC on Wednesday that the death toll was close to 300.

An Al Jazeera article from July 16, 2025, reports on strikes near the presidential palace and military headquarters, resulting in casualties and mentioning a ceasefire in Suwayda ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/israel-bombards-syrias-damascus-as-us-says-steps-agreed-to-end-violence](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/israel-bombards-syrias-damascus-as-us-says-steps-agreed-to-end-violence)). CNN also reported on Israeli airstrikes in Damascus and the US involvement in ending clashes ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/middleeast/damascus-syria-airstrikes-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/middleeast/damascus-syria-airstrikes-intl)).

The BBC article discusses Israeli strikes on Damascus and government forces in southern Syria, in response to fighting in Suweida, with the Prime Minister of Israel stating they were working to save the Druze. The US agreed on steps to end the violence ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp90l77187zo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp90l77187zo)). The articles include images of soldiers and maps (<image:1>, <image:2>, <image:315>, <image:317>).


### Evidence from `image_search`
The Times of Israel published an image of an Israeli tank near Damascus ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/)) <image:8901>. NDTV published a fact-check on December 10, 2024, determining the claim of Israeli tanks near Damascus to be false <image:8902>.

Al Jazeera published an article about Israel seizing a buffer zone in Syria's Golan Heights, including an image of an Israeli tank <image:8903>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the claim is false. The image search results include a fact-check from December 10, 2024, that labels a similar image of Israeli tanks as "FALSE." The web search results also mention Israeli airstrikes in Damascus in July 2025, but not the presence of tanks.


## Final Judgement
The claim that the image shows the Israeli army reaching Damascus in December 2024 is demonstrably false. A fact-check from December 10, 2024, specifically addresses a similar image of Israeli tanks and labels the claim as false. The web search results also do not support the claim of Israeli tanks reaching Damascus in December 2024.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is false. While there were reports of Israeli airstrikes in Damascus in July 2025, and an image of an Israeli tank near Damascus was published by The Times of Israel, a fact-check from December 10, 2024, specifically debunked a similar claim about Israeli tanks near Damascus, labeling it as "FALSE" ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/report-israeli-tanks-reach-point-25km-from-damascus/)).

CLAIM: An image shows a social media post by actor Mel Gibson about “the end” of Israel and the country’s desire to “destroy everything” in its way.

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The post was not made by Gibson, who does not have any public social media accounts, the actor’s publicist told The Associated Press.

THE FACTS: As [fighting continues](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-11-10-2023-23bdb85ebccb68374464fd816aacd7a1)
 in the latest Israel-Hamas war, some online are sharing the image to falsely suggest that the “Braveheart” star has weighed in.

The image is made to look like a social media post, with a profile photo of Gibson alongside his name and a time stamp, although it isn’t quite the same layout as a post on major platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or X, formerly known as Twitter.

The “post” features a picture of the Israeli flag with an hourglass in the center instead of the Star of David, and is captioned: “Soon the end and they know it, that’s why they want to destroy everything in the way.”

But Alan Nierob, Gibson’s publicist, told the AP in an email that the actor “did not make the post.” Moreover, he confirmed that Gibson “doesn’t have any public social media accounts.”

Posts claimed that Mel Gibson said Israel's time was coming to an end and that's why they're destroying everything in the way.

However, the truth was that Gibson had no public-facing social media accounts. The words next to Gibson's name read, "Soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way."

Mel Gibson (s.bukley/Shutterstock.com)

Organizers of the New Orleans Mardi Gras backpedaled Sunday on their decision to host Hollywood actor and director Mel Gibson as a celebrity guest at the parade after opposition, including from local Jewish groups, arose over the appointment.

The Krewe of Endymion, the largest group participating in the parade scheduled for February 18, announced on Saturday that Gibson would be a “Co-Grand Marshal,” a position reserved for celebrity guests.

However, the decision drew strong backlash from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans and the Greater New Orleans Rabbinic Council, which, in a joint statement, cited Gibson’s “long history” of “antisemitic, racist and misogynistic slurs,” and his “half-hearted attempts to apologize.”

Subsequently, the Krewe of Endymion said on Sunday, less than 24 hours after announcing Gibson’s role, that it had “received significant feedback about our grand marshal announcement, \[and\] some of this commentary included threats that cause us great concern.”

The group did not specify the nature of the threats, nor their source.

“In the best interest of the safety of our riders, special guests and everyone that welcomes us on the streets, Mel Gibson will not ride as a co-Grand Marshal for our 2023 parade,” the statement added.

[! Another wrote: “I’m hearing Mel Gibson was Endymion’s fallback plan after Andrew Tate couldn’t make it.” Tate is a controversial online influencer accused of espousing misogynistic views.

According to The Daily Beast, the Krewe of Endymion boasts a budget of $8 million, and deploys 3,200 riders on 80 floats at each annual Mardi Gras parade.

The Jewish groups that voiced their opposition to Gibson’s inclusion welcomed the decision but said they were “appalled” at his appointment in the first place.

“Given his history of fueling antisemitism and other forms of hate, we find his choice as Grand Marshal of Endymion was completely insulting and shortsighted,” a joint statement said.

“Although we are relieved he is no longer riding, we hope the Endymion leadership will take the opportunity to learn why the selection of Mel Gibson caused such pain and disappointment to the Jewish community as well as the marginalized communities he has harmed in the past.”

It added: “Endymion choosing a Grand Marshal with a strong record of hatred sent the wrong message about the event.”

Gibson infamously claimed in 2006 in a drunken rant that Jews were responsible for “all the wars in the world,” and promoted antisemitic stereotypes in his 2004 blockbuster film “The Passion of the Christ.” Since then he has sought to get back into the Jewish community’s good graces, even donating to a Holocaust survivor aid project.

In 2020, Winona Ryder claimed that Gibson had called her an “oven dodger.” The claims were backed up by screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who said Gibson had repeatedly called Jews “oven dodgers,” “Hebes” and “Jew boys” in his presence.

In 2010, Gibson’s ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva claimed he had physically abused her and released a tape on which the actor could be heard making sexist and racist remarks, including telling her “if you get raped by a pack of n\*\*\*\*s it’ll be your fault.”

**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:47> The image shows a screenshot of an authentic social media post from Mel Gibson saying that Israel will end soon and therefore destroy everything in its way together with a flag in the color of Israel that shows an hourglass."

## Actions
```
web_search("Mel Gibson Israel end destroy everything")
image_search("Israel flag hourglass")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-200700554.html)) both report that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson, which includes the text "soon the end and they know it, that's why they want to destroy everything in the way" and an altered Israeli flag with an hourglass, is fake. Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.

The Times of Israel ([Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/mel-gibson-dropped-from-new-orleans-mardi-gras-amid-outcry-from-jewish-groups/)) mentions Gibson's history of antisemitic remarks. <image:47>, <image:8931>, <image:8935>, <image:8944>


### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results show images of an hourglass with the colors of the Israeli flag. One image shows a flag in the colors of Israel with an hourglass in the middle (<image:8947>), another shows an hourglass with the colors of the Israeli flag (<image:8948>), and a third shows an hourglass in front of an Israeli flag (<image:8950>).

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The evidence indicates that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. Multiple sources, including the Associated Press ([Source](https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-mel-gibson-israel-post-342335121493)) and Yahoo ([Source](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fact-check-mel-gibson-posted-200700554.html)), confirm the post's inauthenticity. Furthermore, Gibson does not have any public social media accounts.


# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The claim is demonstrably false. The evidence from multiple reliable sources confirms that the social media post attributed to Mel Gibson is fake. The post's content and the image of the altered Israeli flag are misrepresented.

Background
----------

See also: [Gaza war protests in Israel § "Bring Them Home Now" protests](/wiki/Gaza_war_protests_in_Israel#"Bring_Them_Home_Now"_protests "Gaza war protests in Israel")

On 7 October 2023, [Hamas](/wiki/Hamas "Hamas")
 mounted [an attack](/wiki/2023_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel "2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel")
 on Israel, abducting an estimated 251 people from the country, as well as killing 1,180 more. Since then, protests have been held in the country demanding the return of the hostages from Gaza.[\[2\]](#cite_note-:4-2)
 The first protest was held on 14 October 2023, in Tel Aviv criticizing the handling of the war by the Israeli government.[\[5\]](#cite_note-bizin-5)
[\[6\]](#cite_note-6)
 Continued perceived inaction by the Israeli government on the issue caused additional rallies, and international rallies were held to mark the six-month anniversary and call for the return of hostages.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

On 1 September 2024, the [Israel Defense Forces](/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces "Israel Defense Forces")
 stated that six hostages taken by Hamas, including [Hersh Goldberg-Polin](/wiki/Hersh_Goldberg-Polin "Hersh Goldberg-Polin")
, had been found dead in a tunnel underneath [Rafah](/wiki/Rafah "Rafah")
. Several protesters were arrested following clashes that broke out after the coffins were taken by police.[\[3\]](#cite_note-:2-3)

# Your Analysis

The image depicts a protest in Israel. The Wikipedia article confirms that the image is related to protests that occurred on September 1, 2024, following the recovery of six dead hostages. The protests involved prop coffins, which aligns with the image. The protests took place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows coffins used in a protest in September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the coffins contained dead Israeli soldiers. The Wikipedia article mentions the recovery of six dead hostages, but it does not specify their status.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. The image shows coffins used in a protest in September 2024, but it is not possible to confirm that the coffins contained dead Israeli soldiers based on the provided evidence.

Thousands of protesters marched through Tel Aviv on Thursday, carrying 27 mock coffins representing 27 hostages killed in Hamas captivity in Gaza, demanding a deal to secure the remaining hostages’ release. Significant crowds also gathered in Rehovot, Eilat and Jerusalem.

It was the fifth straight night of demonstrations, following the [recovery last Saturday](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-recovers-bodies-of-6-hostages-from-gaza-including-one-previously-presumed-alive/)
 of the bodies of six Israeli hostages. They had been murdered days before Israeli troops reached them, almost 11 months after they’d been kidnapped from Israel during Hamas’s October 7 attack.

News of the hostages’ execution sparked outrage in Israel, and drew charges that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been refusing to pursue negotiations with Hamas in earnest, avoiding [concessions](https://www.timesofisrael.com/asked-to-decide-between-hostages-or-philadelphi-netanyahu-said-to-prefer-latter/)
 that might have allowed the Israelis to come home alive but would have endangered his ruling coalition.

As protesters in Tel Aviv gathered at Habima Square ahead of the march, Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was one of the [six slain hostages](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hersh-carmel-alex-eden-or-almog-the-6-hostages-murdered-by-hamas-just-days-ago/)
, accused Netanyahu of “sentencing my cousin to death.”

Some members of the crowd shouted: “Murderer!”

“She was abandoned to her death by a government that could have saved her,” Dickmann said, noting the number of days Gat was held captive. (Adar Ayal)

The hostage families and supporters, carrying the caskets, held a mock funeral procession along Begin Street, in the direction of the Begin-Kaplan intersection, in front of the IDF headquarters.

The Tel Aviv thoroughfare has been a locus of demonstrations for a hostage deal and has been blocked by protesters every night since the slain hostages’ bodies were recovered last weekend.

When the 27 coffins arrived at the intersection, the protest began in earnest, swelling to some 2,000 people, who chanted slogans against the government and in favor of a deal.

“We are all hostages of the government of blood!” protesters yelled."

Protesters say the Israeli government hasn't done enough to secure the release of their loved ones and accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of potentially derailing talks with new demands.

Protesters have staged a sombre march through Tel Aviv carrying makeshift coffins draped with Israeli flags to symbolise the hostages still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. 

They're angry with the Israeli government who they say hasn't done enough to strike a ceasefire and secure the release of their loved ones.

"Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, sentenced Carmel, my cousin, to death," said Gil Dickmann, the cousin of Carmel Gat whose body was recovered by the Israeli military from Gaza on Saturday.

"327 days she was there in Gaza, in captivity. More than 100 were released during a temporary pause in fighting in November and Israeli authorities believe around 70 are still alive in Gaza.

[](#) There were 327 opportunities to bring her back."

Ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have limped along for weeks with both sides accusing the other for the lack of progress.

The United States says it is developing a new proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in hopes of ending the nearly 11-month-old war.

A further complication to the already fragile negotiations is Netanyahu's comments on Wednesday.

He demanded that Israel keep open-ended control of Gaza’s border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi Corridor.

"Gaza must be demilitarized and this can only happen if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, claiming Israeli troops had discovered dozens of tunnels under the border.

The question of Israeli control of the narrow strip of land which it seized in May, has become a central obstacle in the talks.

Hamas has demanded an eventual full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the multi-phase truce deal.

Egypt, a mediator in the talks along with the US and Qatar, has also demanded a concrete timeline for Israeli troops to leave the Philadelphi Corridor.

And in angry public statements on Thursday, the families of hostages accused Netanyahu of derailing ceasefire talks and potentially sacrificing their relatives.

The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since fighting started on October 7 but it doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

Over the border, the death toll in Israel stands at more than 1,100."

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC News website contains an image of coffins draped with the Israeli flag (<image:4548>). Al Jazeera published an article in September 2024 that includes an image of a protest (<image:4549>).

The URLs are: [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l22jnj6go](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l22jnj6go) and [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/hamas-says-gaza-captives-will-return-in-coffins-if-israel-continues-raids](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/2/hamas-says-gaza-captives-will-return-in-coffins-if-israel-continues-raids).


### Evidence from `web_search`
From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2024_Israel_hostage_deal_protests): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses protests in Israel on September 1, 2024, following the recovery of six dead hostages. <image:49> Protests occurred in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and internationally. In Tel Aviv, protesters marched with prop coffins, and the Ayalon Highway was blocked. In Jerusalem, protests took place outside the Prime Minister's Office and Netanyahu's residence. The Histadrut trade union announced a one-day strike. The Israeli government, according to CNN, was concerned about the protests, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an apology. The article also mentions the recovery of six dead hostages, including Hersh Goldberg-Polin.


## Elaboration
The image depicts a protest in Israel. The Wikipedia article confirms that the image is related to protests that occurred on September 1, 2024, following the recovery of six dead hostages. The protests involved prop coffins, which aligns with the image. The protests took place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

The evidence supports the claim that the image shows coffins used in a protest in September 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that the coffins contained dead Israeli soldiers. The Wikipedia article mentions the recovery of six dead hostages, but it does not specify their status.

Therefore, the claim is partially verifiable. The image shows coffins used in a protest in September 2024, but it is not possible to confirm that the coffins contained dead Israeli soldiers based on the provided evidence.

The claim is partially accurate. The image does show coffins used in a protest in September 2024. However, the coffins represented hostages killed in Gaza, not necessarily dead Israeli soldiers.

The protests involved mock coffins draped with Israeli flags (<image:49>) representing hostages killed in Gaza. The protests occurred in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Rehovot, and Eilat. The Euronews article mentions the recovery of the body of Carmel Gat.


## Elaboration
The image shows mock coffins used in protests in September 2024. The Times of Israel and Euronews articles confirm that the coffins represented hostages killed in Gaza. The protests occurred in multiple cities, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

The claim is partially accurate. The image does show coffins used in a protest in September 2024. However, the coffins represented hostages killed in Gaza, not necessarily dead Israeli soldiers.


## Final Judgement
The image depicts mock coffins used in protests in Israel in September 2024. These coffins represented hostages killed in Gaza, not necessarily dead Israeli soldiers. The claim is therefore partially accurate, as it correctly identifies the image as related to a protest in September 2024, but it misrepresents the specific context of the coffins.

`false`

In late May, Collboni’s Socialist-led council voted to cut “all institutional ties with the current Israeli government until human rights in Gaza are respected,” reversing his own September 2024 decision to restore Tel Aviv ties, which had been severed by his predecessor Ada Colau.

The council’s move included economic steps to block cooperation with companies linked to Israel, as identified by the UN for alleged illegal operations in territories harming Palestinian rights, economy, society and culture. It also directed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged Barcelona’s port to deny docking to ships carrying arms to Israel.

Barcelona mayor cancels trip to Israel amid entry ban
=====================================================

22 August 2025 16:42

**Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni on August 22, two months after his city council cut all institutional ties with the Israeli government and ended its twin-city partnership with Tel Aviv.**

Collboni, who had planned to visit Yad Vashem and the Palestinian Authority, cancelled his trip following the refusal, **[Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en)
** reports, **[citing](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3q42skex)
** Israeli media.

His entry request through the ETA system, which pre-screens travellers from visa-exempt countries, was rejected due to his anti-Israel statements. It also instructed the Fira de Barcelona trade fair to exclude Israeli pavilions and urged the city’s port to deny docking to ships transporting arms to Israel.

The move mirrors Spain’s position among 21 nations condemning Israel’s E1 plan in Ma’ale Adumim, which disrupts Palestinian territorial continuity between Ramallah and Bethlehem and has been described as a potential “death knell” for a Palestinian state.

Like yesterday in Bethlehem, Barça’s tip to Jerusalem on Sunday has all been about the hope for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The touring party visited the residence of the president of Israel, **Shimon Peres**, where **Sandro Rosell**, accompanied by members of his board, was once again granted the kind of treatment usually afforded to heads of state. The Israeli prime minister, **Benjamin Netanyahu**, was also in attendance

Both Peres and Netanyahu were hugely grateful to Barça for this visit, and praised the club for its commitment to social and charity issues. The meeting, broadcast live on television, was all about building bridges towards dialogue, and ended with the first team players posing for a picture with the three main protagonists.

**Shimon Peres: “You are messengers of peace”**

**Shimon Peres**, the president of Israel, started his speech by saying that Barça’s visit “is a dream come true for the children of Israel and Palestine … It is a contribution to peace. Thank you very much.”**

He also remembered **Tito Vilanova**: **“In Jerusalem, we are praying for him, and wish him a speedy recovery”** he said, while also revealing that he is very up to date with events at Barça: “I always watch you” he said, while jokingly adding that the best way to win peace would be to have “Messi, Iniesta and Xavi on the pitch.”

**Common points between Israel and Palestine**

**Sandro Rosell** commented that Barça’s trip “is just a drop in the ocean."

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain's second-largest city -- a top tourist destination and home to one of the world's best-known football clubs -- adds to a growing list of critics of Israel's devastating war in Gaza.

Barcelona's move comes a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel's military operations in Gaza.

Barcelona's move comes a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision \[Getty\]

Barcelona's city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, calls for an end to all official relations with Israel "until respect for international law" and the "basic rights of the Palestinian people" are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organiser Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

"The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable," Barcelona's Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

It is not the first time Barcelona has moved to suspend ties with Israel. (Photo by Kamchatka of Geophysical Survey/Anadolu via Getty Images)](/sites/default/files/styles/image_684x385/public/2226999380.jpeg?h=52bad4fe&itok=yVk62pRV)

Among others, Rosell and Faus will be meeting in Tel Aviv with Israeli president Shimon Peres. In July 2011, Mahmud Abbas visited FC Barcelona, where he was welcomed by institutional vice president Carles Vilarrubí.

FC Barcelona believes it is important for children to be involved in this peace process. In this regard, in October 2011, the club’s Foundation organised a meeting between Israeli and Palestinian children at its La Masia Oriol Tort training facility and residence, where the youngsters attended peace workshops and played matches together. The FC Barcelona Foundation also collaborates with YaLa, the youth social movement created by initiative of the Peres Center for Peace to foster coexistence between the two communities, organising events and activities on the club facilities whenever they visit Barcelona.

**Shimon Peres: “You are messengers of peace”**

**Shimon Peres**, the president of Israel, started his speech by saying that Barça’s visit “is a dream come true for the children of Israel and Palestine … It is a contribution to peace. Thank you very much.”**

He also remembered **Tito Vilanova**: **“In Jerusalem, we are praying for him, and wish him a speedy recovery”** he said, while also revealing that he is very up to date with events at Barça: “I always watch you” he said, while jokingly adding that the best way to win peace would be to have “Messi, Iniesta and Xavi on the pitch.”

**Common points between Israel and Palestine**

**Sandro Rosell** commented that Barça’s trip “is just a drop in the ocean. But it’s a very important drop.” Like in Bethlehem, the Barça president mentioned how pleased everyone at the club is to see that peace negotiations are back under way, adding that **“on this visit we have been able to see that both in Israel and Palestine, most children support Barça …** We fight to win titles, but we also want to be your friends forever.”

Like yesterday in Bethlehem, Barça’s tip to Jerusalem on Sunday has all been about the hope for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The touring party visited the residence of the president of Israel, **Shimon Peres**, where **Sandro Rosell**, accompanied by members of his board, was once again granted the kind of treatment usually afforded to heads of state. The Israeli prime minister, **Benjamin Netanyahu**, was also in attendance

Both Peres and Netanyahu were hugely grateful to Barça for this visit, and praised the club for its commitment to social and charity issues."

Caliber.Az ([https://caliber.az/en/post/barcelona-mayor-cancels-trip-to-israel-amid-entry-ban](https://caliber.az/en/post/barcelona-mayor-cancels-trip-to-israel-amid-entry-ban)) also reports on the entry ban of the Barcelona Mayor.

FC Barcelona's website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/noticias/1136715/message-of-peace-in-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/noticias/1136715/message-of-peace-in-israel)) discusses a "Message of peace in Israel" event that included Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the FC Barcelona president Sandro Rosell. The article mentions a "Peace Tour" and includes images of the event. <image:8991>, <image:8992>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The President of FC Barcelona met with Israel Embassy Representatives, and the image shows them holding the Israeli flag (<image:8993>). FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel (<image:8994>). A Shutterstock image shows a fan holding an Israeli flag at a FC Barcelona event (<image:8995>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has engaged with Israeli representatives and displayed the Israeli flag. The image search results show the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding the Israeli flag. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the meeting occurred in September 2024 or during the Gaza war.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed without additional information. Specifically, the date of the meeting and the context of the Gaza war need to be verified.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war."

## Actions
```
web_search("FC Barcelona Israel Embassy September 2024")
image_search("FC Barcelona Israel flag")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Ynet News ([https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3q42skex](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj3q42skex)) reports that Israel denied entry to Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni due to his anti-Israel stance and his city council's decision to sever ties with the Israeli government. Caliber.Az ([https://caliber.az/en/post/barcelona-mayor-cancels-trip-to-israel-amid-entry-ban](https://caliber.az/en/post/barcelona-mayor-cancels-trip-to-israel-amid-entry-ban)) also reports on the entry ban of the Barcelona Mayor.

FC Barcelona's website ([https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/noticias/1136715/message-of-peace-in-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.es/es/noticias/1136715/message-of-peace-in-israel)) discusses a "Message of peace in Israel" event that included Shimon Peres and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the FC Barcelona president Sandro Rosell. The article mentions a "Peace Tour" and includes images of the event. <image:8991>, <image:8992>.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The President of FC Barcelona met with Israel Embassy Representatives, and the image shows them holding the Israeli flag (<image:8993>). FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel (<image:8994>). A Shutterstock image shows a fan holding an Israeli flag at a FC Barcelona event (<image:8995>).

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has engaged with Israeli representatives and displayed the Israeli flag. The image search results show the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding the Israeli flag. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state that the meeting occurred in September 2024 or during the Gaza war.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully confirmed without additional information. Specifically, the date of the meeting and the context of the Gaza war need to be verified.

From Jan. 29 - More than 100 Gazans are killed queuing for aid in the presence of Israeli troops who opened fire in one of the deadliest incidents of the war.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back more than a century, with flashpoints building from the United Nations’ 1947 initial UN Partition Plan to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, to the recent Israel-Hamas war sparked in October 2023.

Despite continued efforts at brokering peace—including the 1979 Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, and the 2020 Abraham Accords—conflict has persisted.

This timeline explores some of the pivotal moments in the conflict from 1947 to today.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. <image:9020>

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).  

The Hamas leader had arrived in Tehran earlier this week and had attended events at the parliament and an exhibition near Milad Tower before retiring to his residence.

Neither Hamas nor Iranian officials have yet commented publicly on the incident. <image:9020>

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS
=============================================================

![Hamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh attends a meeting with members of international media in Gazaa](https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_Article2016_ControlFaceDetect/442230)

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holcoursepopup1.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

The Palestinian digital rights group Sada Social on Saturday [called for](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 an investigation into Israel’s alleged use of WhatsApp user data to target Palestinians with its AI system, Lavender.

The group, which is affiliated with the Al Jazeera Media Institute and Access Now, accused Meta, which owns WhatsApp, of fueling “the ‘Lavender’ artificial intelligence system used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian individuals within the [Gaza](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/gaza)
 enclave.”

As _Common Dreams_ [reported](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-ai-targets)
 in April, the [Israel](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/israel)
 Defense Forces has relied on AI systems including Lavender to target people Israel believes to be Hamas members.

At _+972 Magazine_, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham [wrote](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)
 that a current commander of an elite Israeli intelligence unit pushed for the use of AI to choose targets in Gaza. “The Israeli Lavender system, supported by artificial intelligence, identifies Palestinians by tracking their communications via WhatsApp or the groups they join.”

The mention of Israel’s use of WhatsApp data in Abraham’s reporting also caught the attention last month of Paul Biggar, founder of Tech for [Palestine](https://www.commondreams.org/tag/palestine)
.

“There’s a lot wrong with this—I’m in plenty of WhatsApp groups with strangers, neighbors, and in the carnage in Gaza you bet people are making groups to connect,” [wrote](https://blog.paulbiggar.com/meta-and-lavender/)

_Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The commander wrote in a guide book to create the system that “hundreds and thousands” of features can be used to select targets, “such as being in a WhatsApp group with a known militant, changing cell phone every few months, and changing addresses frequently.”

Sada Social asserted that it had found the Lavender system uses WhatsApp data to select targets.

“The reports monitored by the Sada Social Center indicate that one of the inputs to the ‘Lavender’ system relies on data collected from WhatsApp groups containing names of Palestinians or activists who are wanted by ‘Israel,'” [said](https://sada.social/post/sd-soshal-ydaao-l-thkyk-aaagl-ofory-ltsryb-myta-byanat-mstkhdmy-oatsab-l-algysh-alsrayly)
 the group in a press release. Meta has been promoting WhatsApp as a ‘private’ social network, including ‘end-to-end’ encryption of messages.”

“Providing this data as input for Lavender undermines their claim that WhatsApp is a private messaging app,” he wrote. No social network should be providing this sort of information about its users to countries engaging in ‘pre-crime.'”

Others have pointed out that Israel may have acquired WhatsApp data through means other than a leak by Meta.

Journalist Marc Owen Jones said the question of “Meta’s potential role in this is important,” but noted that informants, captured devices, and spyware could be used by Israel to gain Palestinian users’ WhatsApp data.

Bahraini activist Esra’a Al Shafei, founder of Majal.org, [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 the _Middle East Monitor_ that the reports that WhatsApp user data has been used by the IDF’s AI machine demonstrate why privacy advocates warn against the collection and storage of metadata, “particularly for apps like WhatsApp, which falsely advertise their product as fully private.”

“Even though WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, and claims to not have any backdoors to any government, the metadata alone is sufficient to expose detailed information about users, especially if the user’s phone number is attached to other Meta products and related activities,” Al Shafei said. “This is why the IDF could plausibly utilize metadata to track and locate WhatsApp users.”

While Meta and WhatsApp may not necessarily be collaborating with Israel, she said, “by the very act of collecting this information, they’re making themselves vulnerable to abuse and intrusive external surveillance.”

In turn, “by using WhatsApp, people are risking their lives,” she added.

A WhatsApp spokesperson [told](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240430-is-whatsapp-putting-palestinians-at-risk-of-being-killed-in-gaza/)
 _Anadolu_ last month that “WhatsApp has no backdoors and we do not provide bulk information to any government,” adding that “Meta has provided consistent transparency reports and those include the limited circumstances when WhatsApp information has been requested.”

Al Shafei said Meta must “fully investigate” how WhatsApp’s metadata may be used “to track, harm, or kill its users throughout Palestine.”

“WhatsApp is used by billions of people and these users have a right to know what the dangers are in using the app,” she said, “or what WhatsApp and Meta will do to proactively protect them from such misuse.”

Open Extended Reactions

PARIS -- The International Judo Federation will launch an investigation into why Algeria's Messaoud Redouane Dris failed his weigh-in before a bout with Israel's Tohar Butbul -- which could be part of a pattern of sportsmanship issues.

An IJF spokesperson told ESPN those questions would be answered in due time. "Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport."

The Algerian federation did not immediately respond to comment when contacted by ESPN.

"I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes," Butbul told reporters. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, four judoka athletes failed weigh-ins. Of Israel's 88 athletes at the Olympics, 12 compete in judo. Dris' disqualification marked the third time an opponent has not faced Butbul over the past two Olympics.

"We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts," the IJF said in a statement. However, this isn't the first incident involving controversy and Israeli athletes in the sport. On Sunday, both Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hand of Israel's Baruch Shmailov in the under-66kg event.

In Tokyo, another Algerian, Fethi Nourine withdrew from the Olympics to avoid a potential fight against Butbul in the second round. However French President Emmanuel Macron said ahead of the Games that Israeli athletes were welcome in France, and the interior minister ordered increased 24-hour security for the Israeli Olympians days before the opening ceremony. The investigation is expected to take place at the conclusion of the Olympics, and the federation said further action will be taken if needed. They won't let them compete, even though they are athletes."

Algerian judoka investigated after failing to make weight for bout with Israeli
===============================================================================

This article is more than 11 months old

*   Messaoud Redouane Dris’s actions labelled ‘a disgrace’
*   Fears athletes can become ‘victims of political disputes’

Judo’s governing body is to investigate why Algeria’s Messaoud Redouane Dris failed the weigh-in for his -73kg bout with Israel’s Tohar Butbul at the Paris Olympics, saying athletes can become “victims of broader political disputes”.

The International Judo Federation (IJF) said Dris arrived for the weight control session on Sunday 10 minutes before the deadline and was found to be 400g over the allowed weight limit to compete on Monday. However, an Algerian newspaper hailed the judoka for “smartly avoiding meeting \[the\] Israeli opponent by failing to make the weight”.

One of the Algerian athletes’ sponsors, the telecom giant Mobilis, posted on Facebook: “Dris won everyone’s respect. My heart goes out to this athlete.”

Arad, a former judoka and the first Israeli to win an Olympics medal, told Reuters: “I think this is a disgrace. Algerian media and a sponsor of Algeria’s Olympic athletes hailed Dris.

“Following the [Olympic Games](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games)
, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday. Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

The Paris Games are taking place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October attacks led by the Palestinian group Hamas.

The Algerian Olympic delegation declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Dris was subsequently disqualified, with the bout awarded to Butbul, who then lost in the round of 16.

PARIS (AP) — The International Judo Federation will conduct an investigation after Messaoud Dris of Algeria missed weight at the [Paris Games](https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games)
 on the day before he was scheduled to face Tohar Butbul of Israel.

The bout was scheduled to be the first in the men’s 73-kilogram division Monday, but given its political implications, many suspected it would not happen from the moment Dris and Butbul were matched in the random draw last week.

“Following the Olympic Games, a full review and investigation of the situation will be conducted and further action will be taken if needed,” the IJF said in a statement on Monday.

It added that athletes failing to pass weight control is not unusual at judo competitions, noting that four judokas missed weight at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.

“We believe that sport should remain a realm of integrity and fairness, free from the influences of international conflicts,” the judo federation said. Supreme Court](https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court)

Judo governing body to investigate Algerian who missed weight before Olympic bout against Israeli
=================================================================================================

“I think the Algerian athletes and all the Muslim athletes cannot go to the fight with Israeli athletes,” Butbul said. The IJF said Dris only showed up to the weigh-in 10 minutes before the deadline, which could indicate he had actually been trying and failing to cut weight.

The bout was Butbul’s third walkover victory in the past two Olympics, including two against Algerian opponents. Israel’s presence at the Paris Games has been protested at various points since the beginning of Israel’s offensive in Gaza last year, but the IOC and France’s government have firmly backed Israel’s right to participate.

Israel has one of the biggest judo teams at the Paris Games with 12 participants, and four Israeli judokas competed in the first two days of the tournament at Arena Champ-de-Mars.

Although none of their opponents avoided Israel’s first four judokas, Abderrahmane Boushita of Morocco and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan both refused to shake the hand of Israel’s Baruch Shmailov following their bouts Sunday. “Unfortunately, athletes often become victims of broader political disputes which are against the values of sport.”

Butbul and Israel coach Guy Fogel said they believe Dris was pressured to miss the bout because of Algeria’s fraught relationship with Israel, which has led to several similar incidents in recent judo competitions.

TEL AVIV, July 19 (Reuters) - A long-range Iranian-made drone hit the centre of Tel Aviv in the early hours of Friday in an attack claimed by the Yemen-based [Houthi](/world/middle-east/who-are-yemens-houthis-why-are-they-under-attack-2024-01-12/)
 militia that killed one man and wounded four others, the Israeli military and emergency services said.

The explosion, which footage shared on social media suggested came from the sea and did not trigger air raid alarms, occurred hours after the Israeli military [confirmed](/world/middle-east/commander-hezbollahs-radwan-forces-killed-israeli-strike-south-lebanon-two-2024-07-18/)
 it had killed a senior commander of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in southern Lebanon.

Chief spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military assessed that the drone, which hit a building near the beachfront close to U.S. Embassy premises in Tel Aviv, was an upgraded Iranian-made Samad-3 model.

"Our estimation is that it arrived from Yemen to Tel Aviv," he told a press briefing.

A spokesman for the Houthis, which like Hezbollah are aligned with Iran, said the group had attacked Tel Aviv with a drone and would continue to target Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war.

The attack, which took place ahead of a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week, is likely to fan fears about further fallout from the Gaza war as the Houthis and other Iranian proxies side with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant met military commanders to review air defences and said the country had to be ready for all scenarios. "We must be prepared for defensive and offensive actions," he said, according to a statement from his office.

An Israeli official said the military was still investigating why the drone did not trigger the alarm, but initial reports suggested the aircraft was identified but the sirens were not sounded due to human error.

"We're talking about a large UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that can fly large distances," the military official told journalists after the strike.

**\[1/12\]**A man looks at a building damaged at the site of an explosion, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict in Tel Aviv, Israel July 19, 2024. The mayor of Tel Aviv said the city, Israel's economic centre, had been moved to a state of heightened alert.

In the hours following Friday's attack, sirens sounded repeatedly in areas close to the border with Lebanon and Israeli air defences intercepted at least one aerial target that crossed into Israel.

"OPERATION ACHIEVED ITS GOALS"
------------------------------

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree called Tel Aviv a primary target "within the range of our weapons".

He said the strike was carried out using a new drone called "Yafa", which he said was capable of bypassing interception systems and undetectable by radars.

"The operation has achieved its goals successfully," Saree said in a televised speech.

Israel's emergency services said the body of a 50 year-old man was found in an apartment close to the explosion and four people were taken to hospital with slight shrapnel injuries.

The military said air patrols had been increased to protect Israeli airspace but said it had not ordered new civil defence measures. All of them were later released, health services said.

Israel has been exchanging daily missile and artillery fire with Hezbollah along its northern border and in southern Lebanon since the start of the war in Gaza, prompting fears of a wider regional conflict if the situation escalates.

The Houthis have also stepped up attacks against Israel and Western targets, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip following last year's attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel.

Hamas-led fighters stormed Israeli towns on Oct. Since then, nearly 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, according to health authorities in the enclave.

[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](#after-bottom) It was at least the sixth such attack over the past month.

The attack set off air-raid sirens across central Israel ordering hundreds of thousands of residents to enter reinforced bomb shelters. The missile landed in a playground in Tel Aviv in the middle of the night.

Yahya Saree, a military spokesman for the Houthis, said the group’s fighters had launched the missile “to aid the victory of the oppressed Palestinian people and its fighters.” He also claimed it had struck a “military target.”

On Thursday, Israeli fighter jets flew over 1,000 miles to bombard sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including the capital, Sana. The Israeli military said it had struck power plants as well as fuel and oil tanks.

Israel and the Houthis, who control much of northwestern Yemen, have traded fire since October 2023, when the Yemeni militia began firing rockets and drones at Israel in what it has described as a campaign in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

 top leaders.[\[4\]](#cite_note-:7-4)
 Survivors reported that they were targeted without warning in an area they were told was safe.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5)

 or [Ismail Haniyeh](/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh "Ismail Haniyeh")

CNN  — 

At least 30 people have been killed and over 100 injured in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Deir-al Balah, central Gaza, where thousands were sheltering, Palestinian officials said.

The Israeli military said it had launched the strike in order to destroy a Hamas command and control center inside the compound.

Most of the victims from the school arriving to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the aftermath of the attack were women and children, according to Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for the hospital.

Footage filmed by CNN inside the hospital morgue showed dead bodies on the floor and people coming in to identify their loved ones, with children among the deceased.

The emergency room is seen to be overwhelmed by casualties and has no more space for patients. One young man was seen receiving medical treatment on the floor.

Most of those brought to the hospital with injuries are children, including one young boy who was receiving treatment and soon after died with the word “unidentified” written on his stomach.

The strike came soon after Israeli’s military issued fresh evacuation orders further south, in the city of Khan Younis, where Israel launched a fresh offensive earlier in the week which has killed dozens of Palestinians.

Residents in southern neighborhoods were told to leave after being warned that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would “forcefully operate” in the area.

Fighting has been ongoing on Gaza for months, and the renewed offensive shows Israel’s challenges in achieving its goal of eliminating Hamas. It added that the location previously defined as a humanitarian area “will be adjusted.”

Al-Mawasi has come under repeated Israeli attacks, including a strike on July 14 which [reportedly](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl/index.html)
 killed 90 people and injured 300 more.

An eyewitness in Khan Younis told CNN that she was “woken up by the screams” of people as they fled the area following the evacuation order, saying she heard explosions and saw flares in the sky.

Scenes filmed by CNN in Khan Younis show people fleeing by car, motorbike, and donkey cart with all of their belongings. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities.

Israeli military action in Gaza has since killed 39,258 Palestinians and injured another 90,589, according to the Ministry of Health there. As of early July, [nearly 2 million people](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html)
 had been displaced in Gaza – almost the entire population, according to figures from the UN.

Aid agencies working in Gaza have warned previously that new rounds of evacuation orders are making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult.

“People in Gaza are exhausted, living in inhumane conditions, with no safety at all,” the UN Relief and Works Agency posted on X on Monday.

On Thursday, the IDF said it had recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages the previous day from a tunnel in an area of Khan Younis which it had previously designated as a “humanitarian area.”

Despite the fighting, US and Israeli officials expressed optimism [this week](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/politics/gaza-ceasefire-prospects-netanyahu-congress/index.html)
 over the possibility of a ceasefire and hostage deal being reached.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that the different parties are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line.”

Negotiations are set to resume in Rome on Sunday, two sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.

The US team will be led by CIA Director Bill Burns, who will be joined by his counterparts from Qatar, Egypt, and Israel.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington this week and met with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who urged him to seal an agreement.

“As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done,” said Harris. Israel said that about 100 militants had been killed during recent fighting.

The United Nations estimated that about 150,000 people fled Khan Younis on Monday alone, intensifying pressure on meager supplies of food and water, and places to seek shelter.

Signaling another campaign was imminent, the IDF wrote on Telegram it was “about to forcefully operate against the terrorist organizations and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the southern neighborhoods of Khan Yunis to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi.”

The statement said the move was in retaliation to “significant terrorist activity and rocket fire” emanating from southern Khan Younis. I don’t know where to go,” said one man.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit a school being used by displaced Palestinians in central Gaza on Saturday, killing at least 30 people including several children, as the country’s negotiators prepared to meet international mediators to discuss a proposed cease-fire.

At least seven children and seven women were among the dead taken from the girls' school in Deir al-Balah to Al Aqsa Hospital. Israel's military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against Israeli troops and develop and store "large quantities of weapons.” Hamas in a statement called the military’s claim false.

Civil defense workers in Gaza said thousands had been sheltering in the school, which also contained a medical site.

According to Israeli estimates, about 1.8 million Palestinians shelter in the zone after being uprooted multiple times during Israel’s punishing air and ground campaign. "What happens is when people have these orders, they have very little time to move.”

Associated Press journalists saw a dead toddler in an ambulance and bodies covered with blankets. Israel expanded the zone in May to take in people fleeing the southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s population at the time had crowded.

Gaza Health Ministry officials said the evacuation orders had forced at least three health centers to stop providing care and compounded issues such as piled-up waste and shortages of supplies.

In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:59> This image shows a palestinian child stuck under the rubble in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike in July 2024."

## Actions
```
geolocate(<image:59>)
web_search("Israeli airstrike Gaza July 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `geolocate`
The most likely countries where the image was taken are: {'Palestine': 0.51, 'Israel': 0.24, 'Jordan': 0.11, 'Russia': 0.02, 'Canada': 0.01, 'Colombia': 0.01, 'France': 0.01, 'Sweden': 0.01, 'Turkey': 0.01, 'Ukraine': 0.01}

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. One source details the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, and mentions reactions from various international bodies. Another source reports on an airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah on July 27, 2024, resulting in at least 30 deaths. The NPR article also reports on the same airstrike on a school in Gaza, which was being used as a shelter, resulting in at least 30 deaths, including children. <image:59>

## Elaboration
The evidence supports the claim that the image was taken in Palestine, with a 51% probability according to the geolocation data. The web search confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024, which could have caused the situation depicted in the image.

The web search results mention specific airstrikes in July 2024, including one on a school in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to any specific event.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image depicts a Palestinian child, that the child is under rubble, and that the rubble is a result of an Israeli airstrike.

===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search results provide an image of a woman in rubble in Gaza, which supports the context of the claim. However, the search results do not include the original image.

The evidence still does not explicitly link the original image to an Israeli airstrike or confirm the child's identity.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to find the original image in the search results and confirm the details.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.

# Your Judgement



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The geolocation data suggests the image was likely taken in Palestine. Web searches confirm Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to a specific event or confirm the child's identity or the cause of the rubble. Further image searches did not yield the original image.

The claim cannot be fully verified due to the lack of direct evidence linking the image to an Israeli airstrike or confirming the child's identity and the cause of the rubble. `not enough information`

### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources discuss Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024. One source details the 13 July 2024 al-Mawasi attack, which resulted in numerous deaths and injuries, and mentions reactions from various international bodies. Another source reports on an airstrike on a school in Deir al-Balah on July 27, 2024, resulting in at least 30 deaths. The NPR article also reports on the same airstrike on a school in Gaza, which was being used as a shelter, resulting in at least 30 deaths, including children. <image:59>

## Elaboration
The evidence supports the claim that the image was taken in Palestine, with a 51% probability according to the geolocation data. The web search confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in July 2024, which could have caused the situation depicted in the image.

The web search results mention specific airstrikes in July 2024, including one on a school in Deir al-Balah. However, the evidence does not explicitly link the image to any specific event.

To fully verify the claim, additional information is needed to confirm that the image depicts a Palestinian child, that the child is under rubble, and that the rubble is a result of an Israeli airstrike.


## Actions
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The web sources include an NPR article with an image of a woman in rubble in Gaza (<image:9086>

The image search results provide an image of a woman in rubble in Gaza, which supports the context of the claim. However, the search results do not include the original image.

The evidence still does not explicitly link the original image to an Israeli airstrike or confirm the child's identity.

To verify the claim, it is necessary to find the original image in the search results and confirm the details.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."

[We use cookies in a limited and restricted manner for specific purposes. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

"Northern Gaza is experiencing a severe shortage of food and vegetables."

[Israel's genocide in Gaza](/topics/israel-genocide-gaza)

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers.

Since the start of the Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in late October 2023, the release of combat dog attacks on civilians has become common, with the Israeli military systematically deploying them to search buildings using cameras. It dragged me down the corridor, and I could feel pieces of my flesh falling as it bit into me."

The dog attack, which lasted about 10 minutes, left Arian in unbearable pain and caused complications that would last for months, ultimately leading to the loss of her newborn. "It's the army," he said.

### ‘It wasn’t a regular dog’

But when the house suddenly lit up, they realised it wasn’t soldiers, but a dog, with a light and a camera on its head, entering each room in the house.  

The dog broke through the door and attacked her 17-year-old sister, who was seven-months pregnant."
