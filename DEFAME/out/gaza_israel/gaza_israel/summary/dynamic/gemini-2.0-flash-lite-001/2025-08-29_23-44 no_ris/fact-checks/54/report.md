### Evidence from `web_search`
The U.S. State Department arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe starting October 13, 2023, due to terrorism and civil unrest, as reported by ABC News ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725)) ![image 8701](media/2025-08-30_00-02-1756512175-792682.jpg). Reuters also reported on October 12, 2023, that the U.S. State Department will offer charter flights to help Americans leave Israel, with passengers asked to repay the U.S. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/)) ![image 8719](media/2025-08-30_00-03-1756512198-641689.jpg).

CBS News reported that the U.S. government is not offering loans to Americans ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-huckabee-us-evacuation-americans-in-israel/)).


## Elaboration
The U.S. government is offering emergency loans to U.S. citizens in Lebanon to relocate to safer areas amid the escalating conflict between Hezbollah and Israel ([https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/](https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/how-americans-can-leave-lebanon-beirut-us-citizens-assistance-embassy/)). The U.S. State Department arranged chartered flights for American citizens in Israel to Europe starting October 13, 2023 ([https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-announces-plan-fly-americans-israel/story?id=103934725)). Passengers were asked to repay the U.S. for the flights ([https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-working-charter-flights-help-americans-leave-israel-sources-2023-10-12/)).

The claim that the U.S. government is offering loans to Americans in Lebanon is supported by the evidence. However, the evidence does not support the claim that the U.S. has been flying Israeli citizens out of Israel on chartered flights for a year "on US taxpayers' dime." The flights were for American citizens, and passengers were expected to repay the U.S.


## Final Judgement
The U.S. government is offering loans to Americans in Lebanon, and chartered flights were arranged for American citizens in Israel. The flights were not for Israeli citizens, and passengers were expected to repay the U.S. for the flights. Therefore, the claim is partially false. `false`
