Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/netanyahus-house-hit-by-drone-as-israel-and-hezbollah-trade-blows-in-lebanon): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on October 19, 2024, reporting that Benjamin Netanyahu's house in Caesarea was hit by a drone. <image:4623> The article mentions that the attack caused superficial damage and no casualties. The article also mentions that Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for the attack.

The claim '<image:53> This image shows Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's house taken by a Hezbollah drone in August 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While the image is likely of Benjamin Netanyahu's house, as confirmed by multiple news sources and geolocation data, the attack occurred in October 2024, not August 2024, as stated in the claim.

So, the overall veracity is: false
