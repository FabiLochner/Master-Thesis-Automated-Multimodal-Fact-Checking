Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-was-facing-destruction-at-the-hands-of-iran-this-is-how-close-it-came-and-how-it-saved-itself/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports on damage caused by Iranian ballistic missiles in Israel, including the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot and the Soroka hospital complex in Beersheba, in June 2025. <image:13320>, <image:13321>. The article also mentions damage in Ramat Gan, where over 2,000 homes were destroyed or damaged.

The claim '<image:48> This is an authentic image of Israeli Air Force's Ramat David airbase that was attacked by Hezbollah on September, 22, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. While there are reports of Hezbollah attacks on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, and the airbase is on Iran's target list, the image's authenticity could not be confirmed through reverse image searches or other searches.

So, the overall veracity is: false
