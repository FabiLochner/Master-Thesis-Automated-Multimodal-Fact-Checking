reverse_search(![image 25](media/37.jpg))
web_search("Hezbollah rocket Israel July 27 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The Anadolu Agency fact-checked the claim that the image shows a child who died in a Hezbollah rocket attack in Israel. The article states that the image is a stock photo and the child in the image is not Malak, but Julia Ghirarda, who lives in the USA. The article also mentions a rocket attack on July 27 in the Golan Heights, where 12 people, including children, died.

The website mako.co.il also contains the image, but the articles are not related to the claim. [Source](https://www.mako.co.il/4fb2cc2308a9c110/Editor-8345f0d2f186c81026.htm?page=6) ![image 484](media/2025-07-18_13-46-1752846405-777120.jpg)


### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results include a Wikipedia article about the timeline of the Israelâ€“Hezbollah conflict from July 27, 2024, to September 16, 2024, which mentions a Hezbollah rocket striking a soccer field in Majdal Shams on July 27, 2024, killing 12 children. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hezbollah_conflict_(27_July_2024_%E2%80%93_16_September_2024)))

Reuters reports that a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27, 2024, killed 12 people, including children. ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nine-people-killed-rocket-hits-football-pitch-israeli-occupied-golan-israel-2024-07-27/)) Al Jazeera reports that at least 12 people were killed and 30 wounded in a rocket attack on a football pitch in Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/27/israel-says-10-killed-in-rocket-attack-on-occupied-golan-heights)) The image ![image 5126](media/2025-08-23_01-31-1755912715-728512.jpg)

## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image is a stock photo of a child named Julia Ghirarda, not a victim of the rocket attack. The rocket attack did occur on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights, killing 12 children.


## Final Judgement
The image is not related to the rocket attack. The image is a stock photo of a child named Julia Ghirarda. The rocket attack did occur on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights, killing 12 children. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in the claim is a stock photo of a child named Julia Ghirarda, not a victim of the Hezbollah rocket attack. While the attack did occur on July 27, 2024, in the Golan Heights, killing 12 children, the image is unrelated, as confirmed by the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/teyithatti/aktuel/fotograftaki-kiz-mecdel-sems-saldirisinda-olenlerden-biri-mi/1818078](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/teyithatti/aktuel/fotograftaki-kiz-mecdel-sems-saldirisinda-olenlerden-biri-mi/1818078)).
