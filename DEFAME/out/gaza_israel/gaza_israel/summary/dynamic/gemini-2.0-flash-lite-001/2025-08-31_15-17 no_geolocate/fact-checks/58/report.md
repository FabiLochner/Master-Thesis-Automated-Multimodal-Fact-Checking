## Claim
Claim: "![image 33](media/58.jpg) This image shows Gaza, completely destroyed, in December 2024."

## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 33](media/58.jpg))
web_search("Gaza destroyed buildings")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Wikipedia article discusses the destruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, stating that nearly 80% of the buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by July 2025. The article also mentions that Israel destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries as of January 2025. The article does not contain the image.

A UN News article from April 2025 reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict. The article includes an image of a bulldozer removing rubble in Gaza City. The Bloomberg article contains no information.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that a significant portion of buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed. The Wikipedia article states that nearly 80% of buildings were damaged or destroyed by July 2025, and the UN News article reports that approximately 92% of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the conflict.

The claim states that the image shows Gaza completely destroyed in December 2024. The evidence supports the claim that there was significant destruction in Gaza. However, the evidence does not confirm that the image is from December 2024.

I need more information to verify the date of the image.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
The search results include articles from Al Jazeera and CNN published in December 2024, both featuring images of destroyed buildings in Gaza.

The claim is likely true.
