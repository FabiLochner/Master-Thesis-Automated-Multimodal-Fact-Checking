The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be fully verified. While the evidence confirms that there were Israeli airstrikes in the Shejaeya neighborhood in Gaza in April 2025, as reported by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike), [PBS News](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-strikes-on-gaza-kill-at-least-100-including-many-sheltering-at-school), and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/at-least-27-killed-in-israeli-bombing-of-shelter-in-gaza-city-rescuers-say), it does not provide any information about Sham Imad Muhareb or whether she lost her arm.

So, the overall veracity is: false
