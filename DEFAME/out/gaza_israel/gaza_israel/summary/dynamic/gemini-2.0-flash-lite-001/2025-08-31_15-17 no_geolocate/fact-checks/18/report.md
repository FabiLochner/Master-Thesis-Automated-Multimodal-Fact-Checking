## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from Stacker.com ([Source](https://stacker.com/stories/celebrities/25-celebrities-whose-stars-were-defaced-hollywoods-walk-fame)) discusses celebrities whose stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame have been defaced, including Michael Bublé, Bob Marley, and Harry Houdini. The Times Now News article ([Source](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/was-donald-trumps-hollywood-star-vandalized-recently-fact-checking-viral-claims-article-119361540)) fact-checks claims of recent vandalism of Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star, stating that circulating photos are from 2016 and 2018.

Entertainment Weekly ([Source](https://ew.com/fact-check-was-gal-gadot-s-hollywood-star-destroyed-11700747?srsltid=AfmBOooVqXc58NyNpsz4t76lBvAt78ovaezdoKZCubefXpQfgBCLBIW-)) discusses a viral post showing a vandalized Hollywood Walk of Fame star, potentially belonging to Gal Gadot (![image 15](media/18.jpg)). The article mentions that Gadot's Walk of Fame ceremony was disrupted by protestors and that the images resemble the damage done to Donald Trump's Hollywood star in 2018.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the claim is likely false. The image shows a vandalized star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, potentially belonging to Gal Gadot. However, the Entertainment Weekly article ([https://ew.com/fact-check-was-gal-gadot-s-hollywood-star-destroyed-11700747?srsltid=AfmBOooVqXc58NyNpsz4t76lBvAt78ovaezdoKZCubefXpQfgBCLBIW-]) indicates that the damage in the image resembles the damage done to Donald Trump's star in 2018.

The evidence does not explicitly state when Gal Gadot received her star or when the alleged vandalism occurred. However, the fact that the damage resembles that of Trump's star, which was vandalized in 2018, casts doubt on the claim that the vandalism happened in March 2025.

More information is needed to confirm the exact date of the vandalism and whether the star in the image belongs to Gal Gadot.


## Final Judgement
The evidence suggests that the image may not be related to Gal Gadot's star being destroyed in March 2025. The damage in the image resembles that of Donald Trump's star, which was vandalized in 2018. The exact date of the vandalism and the identity of the star in the image are not confirmed.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification

The exact date of the vandalism and the identity of the star in the image are not confirmed.
