## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The article from [MAP](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza) published on October 30, 2024, discusses Keir Starmer's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. The article includes a photo of Keir Starmer and David Lammy. ![image 1](media/0.jpg) The article states that Starmer and Lammy claim Israel is an "important ally," but the UK should not be an ally to atrocities.

The Guardian published an article on October 6, 2024, discussing Keir Starmer's call for a ceasefire in Gaza and his urging for unity in Britain. ![image 1011](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006106-695473.jpg), ![image 1012](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006107-233228.jpg), ![image 1010](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006104-876764.jpg) The BBC published an article on June 4, 2024, discussing the pressure on Keir Starmer to take stronger action against Israel regarding the situation in Gaza. ![image 1023](media/2025-07-20_10-08-1753006112-822136.jpg) Starmer described the situation in Gaza as "appalling and intolerable" and repeated calls for a ceasefire. He added that further actions against Israel will be considered, including sanctions.


## Elaboration
The evidence does not support the claim that Keir Starmer stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel in October 2024. While the evidence indicates Starmer has called for a ceasefire and considered further actions, including sanctions, there is no mention of a complete diplomatic boycott. The article from [MAP](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza) suggests that Starmer views Israel as an important ally.


## Final Judgement
The search results show that Keir Starmer has expressed concerns about the situation in Gaza, called for a ceasefire, and considered sanctions against Israel. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the evidence. While Keir Starmer has expressed concerns about the Israel-Gaza conflict, called for a ceasefire, and considered sanctions, there is no evidence from sources like [MAP](https://www.map.org.uk/news/archive/post/1655-keir-starmer-you-canat-say-you-donat-know-that-israel-is-exterminating-palestinians-in-gaza) or the BBC to suggest he stated the UK would boycott all diplomatic relations with Israel.
