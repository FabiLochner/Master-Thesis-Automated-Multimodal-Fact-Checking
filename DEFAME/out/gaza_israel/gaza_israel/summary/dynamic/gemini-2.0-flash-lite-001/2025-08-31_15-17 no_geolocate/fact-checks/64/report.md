## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Esmail Qaani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, appeared in Tehran in June 2025, contradicting earlier reports of his assassination (<image:k>). According to the IDF, Qaani is still alive (![image 13246](media/2025-08-31_15-47-1756655233-688764.jpg)). Reports of Qaani being killed in Israeli airstrikes in June 2025 were not confirmed by Iranian authorities.

## Elaboration
The evidence contradicts the claim. The evidence indicates that Esmail Qaani appeared in Tehran in June 2025, which contradicts the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025. The evidence also does not confirm that Qaani is in Israel.


## Final Judgement
The evidence shows that Esmail Qaani appeared in Tehran in June 2025, which contradicts the claim that he fled Iran in April 2025 and is confirmed safe in Israel.
