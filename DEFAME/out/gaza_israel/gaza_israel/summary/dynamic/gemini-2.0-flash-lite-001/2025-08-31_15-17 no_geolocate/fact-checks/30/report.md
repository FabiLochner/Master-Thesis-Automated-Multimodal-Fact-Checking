### Evidence from `image_search`
The BBC published an article about the Bibas family ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgznx04kgko](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgznx04kgko)). ABC News published an article on February 19, 2025, about Hamas releasing the remains of the Bibas family ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-19/hamas-to-release-remains-of-bibas-family-israel/104953098](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-19/hamas-to-release-remains-of-bibas-family-israel/104953098)).

Al Jazeera published an image of people holding posters with pictures of the Bibas family ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/2/21/live-israel-ramps-up-west-bank-assault-after-bus-blasts-near-tel-aviv](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2025/2/21/live-israel-ramps-up-west-bank-assault-after-bus-blasts-near-tel-aviv)). ![image 3323](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170386-029126.jpg), ![image 3324](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170389-180844.jpg), ![image 3325](media/2025-08-02_21-33-1754170389-310765.jpg)


### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim was found in articles from BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o)), CNN ([https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/07/middleeast/israel-killed-leader-palestinian-mujahideen-brigades-gaza-latam-intl)), and NDTV ([https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/gazas-youngest-hostage-hamas-says-hes-dead-family-hoping-against-hope-7557381)). The BBC article, published on February 19, 2025, discusses Hamas's claim that they would return the bodies of four hostages, including the Bibas family, and that the family was killed in an Israeli bombardment.

The CNN article, published on June 7, 2025, mentions the Bibas family in the context of the Israeli military killing the leader of the Palestinian Mujahideen Movement. The NDTV article, published on December 4, 2023, discusses Hamas's claim that Shiri Bibas and her two sons are no longer alive. ![image 21](media/30.jpg)

The article was published on February 19, 2025, and discussed Hamas's claim that the Bibas family was killed in an Israeli bombardment. However, the claim does not specify the date of the article, and the image in the claim is a screenshot of the BBC article.
