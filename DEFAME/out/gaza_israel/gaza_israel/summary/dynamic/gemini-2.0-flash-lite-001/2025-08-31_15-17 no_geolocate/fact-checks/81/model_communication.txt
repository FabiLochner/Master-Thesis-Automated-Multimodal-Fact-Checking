Many organizations held memorial services and events for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

*   The official New York City observance of the 10th anniversary of September 11 took place at the World Trade Center site at 8:40 am – 12:30 pm Sunday, September 11, 2011. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

 following the [2021 Taliban offensive](/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive "2021 Taliban offensive")
 in which the [Taliban](/wiki/Taliban "Taliban")
 reconquered most of Afghanistan. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the _Reflected Absence_ memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.[\[118\]](#cite_note-sl-crnyc-ann-118)

## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, is described in the search results. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks and was completed in 2009. The memorial includes a 9-meter tall bronze sculpture. Memorial plaques commemorate the nearly 3000 people who perished in the disaster, including five Israelis. <image:50>

The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)) and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks.

The claim states that this memorial is the only one outside the US. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined based on the available information. Additional information would be needed to confirm if this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

# Instructions
You are provided with the record of a fact-check. It contains the Claim to be verified and a documentation of all the fact-checking work along the gathered evidence. Your task is to **summarize the fact-check**. That is, you provide a concise, one-paragraph justification for the final VERDICT based on the knowledge from the Record. Note:
* Be truthful, brief, do not add any additional information besides the information given in the Record. 
* Link key sources in your summary. Use Markdown notation for that. You may link them in-line.
* Don't state the Claim again. Rather focus on the key insights of the fact-check.
* Simply print just the summary.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:50> This image shows Israel's 9/11 memorial which is the only one outside the US."

## Actions
```
web_search("Israel 9/11 memorial")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel, is described in the search results. The memorial, designed by Eliezer Weishoff, is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks and was completed in 2009. The memorial includes a 9-meter tall bronze sculpture. Memorial plaques commemorate the nearly 3000 people who perished in the disaster, including five Israelis. <image:50>

The sources are from Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Living_Memorial_Plaza)) and KKL-JNF ([https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx](https://www.kkl-jnf.org/tourism-and-recreation/scenic-lookouts/center/twin-towers-living-memorial-jerusalem-park.aspx)).


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the image depicts the 9/11 Living Memorial Plaza in Jerusalem, Israel. The memorial is dedicated to the victims of the September 11 attacks.

The claim states that this memorial is the only one outside the US. However, the provided evidence does not explicitly state whether this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.

Therefore, the claim's veracity cannot be fully determined based on the available information. Additional information would be needed to confirm if this is the only 9/11 memorial outside the US.


## Actions
```
web_search("9/11 memorials outside US")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The search results indicate that there are multiple 9/11 memorials outside the US. Memorial Mapping lists countries with 9/11 memorials, including Afghanistan, Australia, Barbados, and others. Wikipedia also lists several 9/11 memorials, including the one in Jerusalem, Israel, which is depicted in the image <image:50>. Architectural Digest also mentions the Jerusalem memorial and other memorials in the US and abroad <image:2256>.

Football - La Liga Santander - FC Barcelona v Valencia - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - September 14, 2019 Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong celebrates scoring their second goal with Sergio Busquets and team mates. Reuters

**An Israeli soccer team said on Thursday it has called off a friendly match with Barcelona after the Spanish team declined to play in Jerusalem, a city that Palestinians want part of as their capital.**

Beitar Jerusalem FC, an Israeli Premier League club, had previously reached a tentative deal to host Barcelona on August 4, a person familiar with the planning told Reuters, although neither club had formally announced the match.

Beitar owner Moshe Hogeg said in a statement he had decided not to sign the contract on the match because "I understood that the price I would have to pay is to boycott Jerusalem ... to lend a hand to those who come out against Jerusalem".

####  [![The Business Standard Google News](/sites/all/themes/sloth/images/google_news.svg) Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel](https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMIivlQsw2ZKrAw?ceid=US:en&oc=3)

A Beitar spokesman said FC Barcelona had asked that the game be played in a city other than Jerusalem, whose eastern sector Israel captured in a 1967 Middle East war and annexed as its capital in a move not recognized internationally.

An FC Barcelona source told Reuters that the game had never been officially confirmed and that there was now no plan to hold it.

The Barca source declined to respond to Hogeg's remarks.

Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they hope will include the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Hogeg said he briefly considered holding the game in Tel Aviv before deciding against it.

"I'm not angry at Barcelona," he said. I don't want to inflame matters, but they weren't willing to sleep in Jerusalem or to visit Jerusalem either."

On Sunday, the Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted FC Barcelona President Joan Laporta as saying the club had not confirmed it would hold any friendly match in Jerusalem.

Barcelona had a history of actions in "clear defence of the rights and freedoms of all peoples of the earth," WAFA quoted Laporta as saying.

### Comments

While most comments will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive, moderation decisions are subjective. "They are not part of this conflict that we have in the Middle East."

Moshe Lion, the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, told Israel's Army Radio: "They (Barcelona) were not willing to come to Jerusalem. Published comments are readers’ own views and The Business Standard does not endorse any of the readers’ comments.

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The image search confirms that the President of FC Barcelona has met with Israeli representatives and held an Israeli flag. The provided evidence does not explicitly state that the meeting occurred in September 2024 or during the Gaza war. However, the CBS News article mentions events in September 2024, and the Yahoo News article mentions the ongoing conflict.

The evidence suggests that FC Barcelona has maintained ties with Israel, despite some political actions. The claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context requires further verification.

To fully verify the claim, I need to confirm the exact date of the meeting depicted in the image and whether the Gaza war was ongoing at that time.

Among others, Rosell and Faus will be meeting in Tel Aviv with Israeli president Shimon Peres. In July 2011, Mahmud Abbas visited FC Barcelona, where he was welcomed by institutional vice president Carles Vilarrubí.

FC Barcelona believes it is important for children to be involved in this peace process. In this regard, in October 2011, the club’s Foundation organised a meeting between Israeli and Palestinian children at its La Masia Oriol Tort training facility and residence, where the youngsters attended peace workshops and played matches together. The FC Barcelona Foundation also collaborates with YaLa, the youth social movement created by initiative of the Peres Center for Peace to foster coexistence between the two communities, organising events and activities on the club facilities whenever they visit Barcelona.

While the move has little practical impact, the decision by Spain's second-largest city -- a top tourist destination and home to one of the world's best-known football clubs -- adds to a growing list of critics of Israel's devastating war in Gaza.

Barcelona's move comes a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision slammed by Israel.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is one of the most outspoken critics in the European Union of Israel's military operations in Gaza.

Barcelona's move comes a year after Spain, Ireland and Norway officially recognised a Palestinian state in a coordinated decision \[Getty\]

Barcelona's city council voted Friday to cut institutional ties with the Israeli government and suspend its friendship agreement with the city of Tel Aviv, citing violations of international law and the rights of Palestinians.

The motion, supported by the governing Socialist party along with far-left and leftist pro-independence groups, calls for an end to all official relations with Israel "until respect for international law" and the "basic rights of the Palestinian people" are restored.

Barcelona will also suspend a 1998 friendship agreement with Tel Aviv-Jaffa, and it urged the trade fair organiser Fira de Barcelona not to host Israeli government pavilions or companies involved in the arms trade or profiting from the conflict in Gaza.

A similar recommendation was made to the Port of Barcelona.

"The suffering and death in Gaza over the past year and a half, and recent attacks by the Israeli government, make any relationship unviable," Barcelona's Mayor Jaume Collboni said during the council session.

It is not the first time Barcelona has moved to suspend ties with Israel. (Photo by Kamchatka of Geophysical Survey/Anadolu via Getty Images)](/sites/default/files/styles/image_684x385/public/2226999380.jpeg?h=52bad4fe&itok=yVk62pRV)

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona has not cut ties with Israel, according to a Yahoo News article, which also mentions the Barcelona City Council suspending ties with the Israeli government in November 2023. The article also mentions a TikTok video claiming the opposite. [<image:13334>] Another article from The Business Standard discusses the cancellation of a friendly match between FC Barcelona and Beitar Jerusalem FC in 2021. [<image:13351>]

A CBS News article mentions the revocation of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's visa by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in September 2024, weeks before a U.N. meeting.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding an Israeli flag (<image:13357>). FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel (<image:13358>).

The evidence suggests that FC Barcelona has maintained ties with Israel, despite some political actions. The claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context requires further verification.

## Claim
Claim: "<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war."

## Actions
```

image_search("FC Barcelona President Israel flag")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona has not cut ties with Israel, according to a Yahoo News article, which also mentions the Barcelona City Council suspending ties with the Israeli government in November 2023. The article also mentions a TikTok video claiming the opposite. [<image:13334>] Another article from The Business Standard discusses the cancellation of a friendly match between FC Barcelona and Beitar Jerusalem FC in 2021. [<image:13351>]

A CBS News article mentions the revocation of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's visa by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in September 2024, weeks before a U.N. meeting.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding an Israeli flag (<image:13357>). FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel (<image:13358>).

## Elaboration
The image search confirms that the President of FC Barcelona has met with Israeli representatives and held an Israeli flag. The provided evidence does not explicitly state that the meeting occurred in September 2024 or during the Gaza war. However, the CBS News article mentions events in September 2024, and the Yahoo News article mentions the ongoing conflict.

The evidence suggests that FC Barcelona has maintained ties with Israel, despite some political actions. The claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context requires further verification.

To fully verify the claim, I need to confirm the exact date of the meeting depicted in the image and whether the Gaza war was ongoing at that time.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website fcbarcelona.fr discusses a trip to Israel and Palestine by President Sandro Rosell and vice president Javier Faus on February 18, 2011, where they met with Israeli and Palestinian Presidents. [<image:13361>] [<image:13360>] The FC Barcelona website mentions a "Peace Tour" visit to Palestine on August 3, 2013.

## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide the exact date of the meeting depicted in the image. However, the evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has engaged with Israeli representatives. The New Arab article from May 30, 2024, mentions the ongoing Gaza war. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context remains unverified.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war."

## Actions
```
web_search("FC Barcelona Israel Embassy meeting September 2024")
image_search("FC Barcelona President Israel flag")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
FC Barcelona has not cut ties with Israel, according to a Yahoo News article, which also mentions the Barcelona City Council suspending ties with the Israeli government in November 2023. The article also mentions a TikTok video claiming the opposite. [<image:13334>] Another article from The Business Standard discusses the cancellation of a friendly match between FC Barcelona and Beitar Jerusalem FC in 2021. [<image:13351>]

A CBS News article mentions the revocation of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's visa by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in September 2024, weeks before a U.N. meeting.


### Evidence from `image_search`
The image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives holding an Israeli flag (<image:13357>). FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel (<image:13358>).

Sources: [https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel) and [https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/2192444/joan-laporta-meets-with-isaac-herzog-president-of-israel).


## Elaboration
The image search confirms that the President of FC Barcelona has met with Israeli representatives and held an Israeli flag. The provided evidence does not explicitly state that the meeting occurred in September 2024 or during the Gaza war. However, the CBS News article mentions events in September 2024, and the Yahoo News article mentions the ongoing conflict.

The evidence suggests that FC Barcelona has maintained ties with Israel, despite some political actions. The claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context requires further verification.

To fully verify the claim, I need to confirm the exact date of the meeting depicted in the image and whether the Gaza war was ongoing at that time.


## Actions
```
web_search("FC Barcelona Israel meeting date")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The website fcbarcelona.fr discusses a trip to Israel and Palestine by President Sandro Rosell and vice president Javier Faus on February 18, 2011, where they met with Israeli and Palestinian Presidents. [<image:13361>] [<image:13360>] The FC Barcelona website mentions a "Peace Tour" visit to Palestine on August 3, 2013. [<image:13363>] An article from The New Arab, published on May 30, 2024, reports that Barcelona's city council voted to cut ties with the Israeli government, citing the ongoing Gaza war. [<image:13351>]


## Elaboration
The evidence does not provide the exact date of the meeting depicted in the image. However, the evidence confirms that FC Barcelona has engaged with Israeli representatives. The New Arab article from May 30, 2024, mentions the ongoing Gaza war. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the meeting's timing and context remains unverified.


## Actions
```
web_search("FC Barcelona Joan Laporta Isaac Herzog meeting date")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The President of FC Barcelona, Joan Laporta, met with Isaac Herzog, the President of Israel, in Jerusalem on July 18, 2021, as reported by Marca.com. [<image:13369>] Jewishwebsite.com mentions Laporta's participation in a tree-planting ceremony in Israel on July 20, 2021, and also mentions the meeting with Herzog. [<image:13357>]


## Elaboration
The meeting depicted in the image occurred on July 18, 2021, as confirmed by Marca.com. The evidence does not support the claim that the meeting happened in September 2024. The Gaza war was ongoing in May 2024, but not in July 2021.

**Verdict: The claim is false.**


## Final Judgement
The image shows a meeting between FC Barcelona's president and Israeli representatives. The meeting took place on July 18, 2021, not in September 2024 as the claim states. The Gaza war was not ongoing at the time of the meeting.

`false`

## Summary

The claim is false. The image depicts a meeting between FC Barcelona's president and Israeli representatives that occurred on July 18, 2021, as reported by Marca.com, not in September 2024. The Gaza war was not ongoing at the time of the meeting.

US to send jets and warships as Iran threatens Israel

The US will deploy additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies, the Pentagon said.

Tensions remain high in the region over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and a key commander of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

Missile defence forces were placed on a state of increased readiness to deploy, the Pentagon said, adding that its commitment to defend Israel was "ironclad".

Iran's leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed "harsh punishment" against Israel for the assassination of Haniyeh.

The Hamas leader was killed in Tehran on Wednesday. increase support for the defence of Israel, and ... Israel responded with an ongoing military operation in Gaza that has killed almost 40,000 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The circumstances surrounding Haniyeh's death are, as yet, still unclear.

On Saturday, [the Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/08/02/mossad-hired-iranian-agents-to-plant-bombs-haniyeh-rooms/)
 reported that Iranian agents hired by Israel's Mossad spy agency had planted bombs in a building where Haniyeh was staying.

The newspaper says that two agents placed bombs in three rooms of an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp guesthouse in Tehran, which were detonated from abroad.

An earlier report by [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 said that the bombs had been snuck into the building two months earlier.

The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.

* * * Iran and its proxy in Gaza blamed the attack on Israel, which has not commented.

Haniyeh, 62, was widely considered Hamas's overall leader and played a key role in negotiations aimed at reaching a ceasefire in the Gaza war.

His death came just hours after Israel claimed it killed Fuad Shukr, the top military commander of Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah.

A Pentagon statement said the new deployments would "improve US force protection... ensure the US is prepared to respond to various contingencies".

The deployments would include additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers, it said.

High alert
----------

On Tel Aviv’s seafront, the mood appears relaxed with bronzed bodies lazing under beach umbrellas.

But few are in any doubt that the Middle East stands perilously close to full- scale war.

Israel is on high alert.

Several international airlines have suspended flights to the country.

Meanwhile, Israeli ministers were sent home this weekend with satellite phones in case of an attack on communication infrastructure.

Earlier on Saturday, Israeli forces killed a Hamas operative in the West Bank.

Dozens of Palestinians were reported to have been killed in strikes on Gaza in the last 24 hours - a reminder that Israel’s war in the region continues even as diplomats scramble to prevent its escalation.

The US military has stepped-up deployments before, on 13 April when Iran launched an attack on Israel with drones and missiles. Israel and its allies shot down almost all of roughly 300 drones and missiles that were fired.

Israel has not commented directly on the strike which killed Haniyeh. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country had delivered "crushing blows" to its enemies in recent days, including the killing of Shukr in Beirut.

He warned Israelis that "challenging days lie ahead... We are prepared for any scenario".

Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable.

"I think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don't want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an off-ramp here and that is that ceasefire deal," Singh said.

An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Mr Netanyahu said on Friday.

Hamas sparked the war with its 7 October attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people. we have heard threats from all sides."

There had been speculation that the Pentagon might not replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group in the Middle East once it completed its ongoing deployment. Still, the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the United States to intercept drones and missiles given the group's vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel.

Iran and Hamas have both accused Israel of carrying out the killing and have pledged to retaliate against their foe. From Karachi, Pakistan.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Business Insider shows a U.S. Navy warship (<image:13370>). The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including an image of a U.S. aircraft carrier (<image:13371>). The World Socialist Web Site published an article on August 13, 2024, discussing the deployment of U.S. warships (<image:13372>).

The sources are: [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-us-navy-warships-near-middle-east-going-to-region-2024-8), [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html), and [Source](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/08/13/zfzr-a13.html).


### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to support the defense of Israel. The deployments included ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers. (<image:12897>, <image:12898>, <image:12899>)

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/)) reported on the deployments.


# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The evidence confirms that the U.S. deployed warships to the Middle East in August 2024 to support Israel. However, the evidence does not specify that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast. Therefore, the claim is partially supported.

The image search results show U.S. Navy warships and aircraft carriers in the Middle East during August 2024. The web search results confirm the deployment of U.S. warships to support Israel in August 2024.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence does not confirm the warships were specifically en route to the Lebanon coast.

JudgePrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
**Determine the Claim's veracity** by following these steps:
1. Briefly summarize the key insights from the fact-check (see Record) in at most one paragraph.
2. Write one paragraph about which one of the Decision Options applies best. Include the most appropriate decision option at the end and enclose it in backticks like `this`.




## Decision Options
* `not enough information`: The fact-check does not contain sufficient information to come to an conclusion. For example,there is substantial lack of evidence or the evidence is inconclusive, conflicting or self-contradictory. In the case of a lack of evidence, state which information exactly is missing. In particular, if no RESULTS or sources are available, pick this decision.
* `true`: The claim is factually accurate when it is confirmed by evidence from multiple and reliable sources.
* `false`: The claim is not factually accurate. This is the case if one of the following three conditions is met:(1) The claim is demonstrably false when it is disproven by evidence from multiple and reliable sources,(2) The claim or image is taken out of context, i.e. the origin, content and/or meaning of a statement or an image is misrepresented. For example, an old claim or an old image is mispresented in a new context in a misleading way,(3) There is not enough evidence to verify the claim or the evidence is conflicting or self-contradictory.

KIEL, Germany (June 19, 2024) – The Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20) arrived in Kiel, Germany, for a scheduled port visit, June 19, 2024.  
  
The ship’s visit to Kiel completes its participation in Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) 24, and builds on the strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Germany. BALTOPS 24 is an annual joint, multinational maritime-focused exercise designed to enhance interoperability, capability, and cohesion among NATO Allies while maintaining freedom of navigation and defending the Baltic Sea region. USS Mount Whitney’s visit to Kiel marks the culmination of its participation in BALTOPS 24 as it travels across the Baltic Sea.  
  
During the USS Mount Whitney’s port visit, Sailors, Marines, and key leaders from the Baltic Region participated in a Post-Sail conference at the Kiel Naval Base, where the discussions centered around capturing the lessons learned from BALTOPS 24, as well as beginning to shape the subsequent iterations of BALTOPS. BALTOPS is an annual training exercise in the Baltic region, with each year building off of the progress from the previous years.  
  
For the duration of BALTOPS 24, Task Force 61/2 (TF 61/2) and Expeditionary Strike Group 2 (ESG-2) combined together as Commander Task Force 162 (CTF 162). CTF 162 was aboard the USS Mount Whitney, which served as the command and control center for the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp (LHD 1), the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS New York (LPD 21) and embarked 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), Special Operations Capable (SOC), all together referred to as the Wasp ARG-24th MEU (SOC). Embarked commands with the Wasp ARG consist of Amphibious Squadron Four, 24th MEU (SOC), Fleet Surgical Team 2, Tactical Air Control Squadron 22, Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 28 and Beach Assault Unit 21.  
  
TF 61/2 was also working closely with NATO Allies throughout BALTOPS 24, to include members of the Spanish Navy aboard the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship-aircraft carrier Juan Carlos I (L 61), the Royal Netherlands Navy aboard the HNLMS Johan de Witt (L 801), and the French Navy aboard the Mistral class amphibious assault and command ship (L 9013).  
  
“The purpose of this \[BALTOPS\] is to enhance our relationships, it’s to continue to build on our interoperability, it’s to showcase the fact that we are committed to this Alliance, and that we are committed to maintaining maritime peace and stability in the Baltic region,” said Brig. Gen. Samuel Meyer, the Commanding General of TF 61/2, who served as the Commander, Landing Forces (CLF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “We are indeed stronger together.”  
  
For the last two weeks, TF 61/2 and ESG-2 were underway on the USS Mount Whitney participating in BALTOPS 24. As one of NATO’s premier maritime-focused exercises, BALTOPS 24 aimed to enhance interoperability and cooperation among allied nations in a complex and dynamic maritime environment. BALTOPS 24 was divided into two at-sea training phases. Combat Enhancement Training (CET) and Force Integration Training (FIT) comprised the first phase, followed by the Final Tactical Phase of the Exercise (TACEX). During the CET/FIT phase, ships and aircraft rehearsed common tactics, techniques, and procedures under a scripted program of events, enabling them to safely operate together as a force. The exercise culminated with the TACEX phase, where forces shifted into a “free-play” portion, and commanders were given more freedom to run their own tactical programs. The TACEX phase was designed to better represent operating in real-world situations.  
  
Participating nations included Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exercise, in its 53rd iteration, provided a unique training opportunity that strengthened combined response capabilities critical to preserving the freedom of navigation and security in the Baltic Sea region. Participating nations exercised a myriad of capabilities that demonstrated the inherent flexibility of maritime forces, including amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, and diving and salvage operations.  
  
“What we practice together is the ability to be interoperable with NATO, and this is a fantastic thing that I believe NATO does better than anyone else, and it really showcases the ability to work together,” says Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson, the commander of ESG-2, serving as the Commander, Amphibious Task Force (CATF) for CTF 162 during BALTOPS 24. “This really highlights the interoperability of NATO, where we can take forces from one nation, and put them on a ship or in a country of another nation, and operate from there seamlessly. That’s our strength when we partner and work together because we are stronger together.”  
  
Unique to BALTOPS 24 was Sweden participating for the first time as a member of NATO. Sweden had participated in previous iterations of BALTOPS as a NATO partner, but BALTOPS 24 was the first time that Sweden participated as an official member of NATO. This year also included a robust medical training package, together with a mass casualty medical drill on several of the ships underway, complete with role players simulating injuries wearing realistic makeup that were treated by the ship’s corpsman and medical officers, showcasing the medical readiness of the ships’ medical teams. Additionally, BALTOPS 24 included a larger chaplaincy contribution in the exercise that was expanded to six participating nations, integrating the chaplains in the military exercises to practice spiritually supporting our key warfare advantage: our service members. Chaplains from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, and the United States participated in the exercise, and conducted several cross-deckings to other NATO surface ships, where they met with the service members on board and led religious services.  
  
These various training evolutions contributed to this year’s successful iteration of BALTOPS 24. Participants in this multinational maritime exercise created and sustained partnerships and practiced a broad range of mission areas to enhance the capabilities of the participating units. More importantly, this exercise strengthened their ability to operate as a cohesive joint and combined force and respond to emerging crises.  
  
Headquartered in Naples, Italy, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa (NAVEUR-NAVAF) operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF, and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations.  
  
For more than 80 years, NAVEUR-NAVAF has forged strategic relationships with Allies and partners, leveraging a foundation of shared values to preserve security and stability.

SummarizeResultPrompt - QUERY:

# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Search Result. **Your task right now is to summarize the Search Result.** What to include:
* information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* relevant images (refer to images by inserting their reference <image:k>)
* if available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the search result.

Do NOT include:
* advertisements
* any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Search Result.
* If the Search Result doesn't contain any relevant information for the fact-checking work, simply print one word in capital letters: "NONE".
* Keep your writing style like in the Examples 1, 2 and 3 provided to you.
* Try to filter out relevant information even if the search result is in a different language.

# Example 1
The search result from America Today provides several photographs of the Notre-Dame Cathedral fire on April 15, 2019. <image:i>, <image:j>, <image:k>. None of the images show the Eiffel Tower in the background. 

# Example 2
NONE

# Example 3
The Guardian discusses a report blaming the Syrian government for a toxic gas attack and condemning their use of chemical weapons. The Guardian mentions the Chemical Weapons Convention and the responsibilities of Syria under the convention. According to The Guardian, The White House condemned the Assad regime for defying the norm against chemical weapons use.

# Record
## Claim
Claim: "<image:55> This image shows U.S. warships being en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024 to support the Israel Defence Forces (IDF)."

## Actions
```
image_search("U.S. warships Lebanon coast August 2024")
web_search("U.S. warships support IDF August 2024")
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `image_search`
Business Insider shows a U.S. Navy warship (<image:13370>). The New York Times published an article on August 2, 2024, about the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, including an image of a U.S. aircraft carrier (<image:13371>). The World Socialist Web Site published an article on August 13, 2024, discussing the deployment of U.S. warships (<image:13372>).

The sources are: [Source](https://www.businessinsider.com/these-us-navy-warships-near-middle-east-going-to-region-2024-8), [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-israel-aircraft.html), and [Source](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/08/13/zfzr-a13.html).


### Evidence from `web_search`
In August 2024, the U.S. deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to support the defense of Israel. The deployments included ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers. (<image:12897>, <image:12898>, <image:12899>)

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/)) reported on the deployments.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. deployed warships to the Middle East in August 2024 to support Israel. However, the evidence does not specify that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast. Therefore, the claim is partially supported.

The image search results show U.S. Navy warships and aircraft carriers in the Middle East during August 2024. The web search results confirm the deployment of U.S. warships to support Israel in August 2024.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence does not confirm the warships were specifically en route to the Lebanon coast.

WASHINGTON  –  

For 75 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a force for peace that stared down the Soviet Union, prevented a larger war in the Balkans, joined in the fight against international terrorism and even now stands ready to defend all NATO territory from Russian aggression.

NATO remains a vital and crucial alliance, and leaders of political parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree that NATO must be deemed one of the most successful collective defense alliances in history.

The alliance grew out of the experiences of the 20th century when great power wars killed more than 100 million people. Western leaders put in place an international order to prevent that sort of cataclysm from happening again. Part of that order was NATO — a collective defense alliance.

President Joe Biden called NATO "the greatest military alliance in the history of the world." Since NATO's founding, U.S. officials of both political parties have credited the alliance with contributing to the security, prosperity and liberty of Americans — and the world. 

And polling this year by the Pew Research Center shows that, though roughly two-thirds of Americans hold a favorable view of NATO — still, that means a third of Americans hold unfavorable opinions about the alliance — a 4% increase since 2023.

This growing increase in isolationist sentiment in the United States is disturbing to leaders of the NATO nations.

Isolationism has a long history in the United States. In 1796, President George Washington wrote in his farewell address that "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." He said this even though Washington probably knew better than most Americans that without an alliance with France in the American Revolution, Britain would have won.

When the United States entered [World War I](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWI/)
 in April 1917, it fought as an "associated" power alongside France and the United Kingdom. The associated power label still left some distance between the U.S. and any entangling alliance.

After the war, American isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s, in part, laid the groundwork for a far more destructive war.

During [World War II](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/WWII/)
, the U.S. was a full ally, alongside the U.K., the Soviet Union, China, France and many others.

That war was so horrific, and the weapons created so destructive, that there was vast support for collective defense. A total of 420,000 Americans were killed in World War II, with many, many more wounded. And the U.S. was fortunate compared to other Allies. The Soviet Union lost up to 25 million and the U.K. — with less than a third of the U.S. population — lost 450,900. Overall, officials estimate that 3% of the Earth's population died in World War II.

Moving forward, the development of atomic weapons meant those casualties would look small if the great powers were to go to war again.

The alliance may seem inevitable. But, as Biden said in remarks commemorating NATO's 75th anniversary, this success didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable.

**Candy vs. Communism**

NATO came into being with the signing of the Washington Treaty on April 9, 1949. The original members of the alliance were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the U.K. and the U.S.

Even as Western leaders signed the treaty, U.S. and allied aircrews were winning the first battle of the Cold War: The Berlin Airlift.

At the end of World War II, the victorious Allied powers administered Germany — with the Americans in the South, the British to the North, the French in the Southwest and the Soviets in the East.

Berlin was a special case. Each of the four powers had a sector in the former Nazi capital, which was deep inside the Soviet quarter. On June 24, 1948, the Soviets cut off Allied ground, rail and river routes into the city.

The allies — primarily the U.S. — answered with a massive airlift called Operation Vittles that supplied the city of more than 2 million people with food, milk, medical supplies and coal. Aircraft landed with metronome-like regularity. Logisticians loaded and unloaded the aircraft with metronomic precision. The operation delivered more than 2.3 million tons of supplies on more than 277,000 flights into the besieged city through September 1949.

The flights brought in more than just necessities. Aircrews noticed children would gather to watch the planes land. One pilot, Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen, attached parachutes to Hershey bars and launched them to the children. He became known as "the Candy Bomber." The gesture gave heart to Berliners of all ages. And it highlighted the difference between the two systems. While the Soviets wouldn't let milk for babies through a blockade, the Americans were dropping candy bars to children.

**Article 5**

The key to the Washington Treaty is Article 5, which pledges a collective response to an attack on any single member.

It goes like this, "The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force."

The treaty never mentions the Soviet Union, but there was little doubt about who was the threat. NATO's first secretary general — Britain's Lord Ismay — said the alliance's purpose was "to keep the Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down."

The alliance became a true deterrent to the Soviet Union. Proof of that came in 1955 when the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact. This was a forced pact of captive nations in the Soviet orbit formed in response to NATO.

NATO stood united when the Soviets crushed a rebellion in Hungary in 1956 when they erected the Berlin Wall in 1961, and when they crushed the democratic movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

While the Soviet Union denigrated NATO, claiming nations would do better for themselves in the Soviet orbit, the alliance continued to grow. In 1952, Greece and Turkey joined, and in 1955, West Germany. Spain joined in 1982.

This solidarity worked. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 shredded the Iron Curtain. Three years later the Soviet Union itself imploded, and the nations of Eastern and Central Europe were free to choose their own courses. A total of 14 former communist nations — from Albania to Slovenia — hurried to join NATO.

**Shared Democratic Values**

NATO is more than a simple alliance of 32 nations. NATO countries share similar world views. "Today, we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values — and our willingness to stand up for them — is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world," Biden said in March as he welcomed NATO's newest member, Sweden, into the alliance. "It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity."

NATO is not just the largest peacetime military alliance in the world, it is integral to American interests and well-being.

"Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression — knowing we are stronger, and the world is safer when we do," Biden said in a statement celebrating the 75th anniversary of NATO's founding.

**Relevant Today**

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 highlighted NATO's importance. "Almost two years after Putin's [unprovoked invasion of Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/)
 — the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades — NATO has grown stronger and more united than ever," Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring nation — forcefully deposing a freely elected government — then other neighboring nations may be endangered.  "Putin is not going to stop at Ukraine," President Biden said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks in Paris on June 8. "All of Europe will be threatened, we are not going to let that happen."  

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin's expansionist tendencies. In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the alliance's goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense. This year, 24 nations are expected to at least make the 2% level and many nations are taking that percentage of expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations. Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a total of $470 billion in defense.

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3 million active duty service members, almost 770,000 Reservists and a $800 billion budget, the U.S. has the largest, best-funded military in NATO.

On the other hand, Russia has roughly 1.15 million active-duty personnel and another 800,000 reservists.

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can bring to the fight.

NATO's members have a collective defense budget that's north of $1.2 trillion. NATO nations share advanced training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are also NATO's overflight agreements, basing arrangements, intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain its forces.

And about those troop numbers: The 32 NATO nations together have about 3,368,000 active-duty personnel, and each NATO nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary formations. This is deterrence in the flesh.

**NATO Around the World**

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia. NATO has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as in Africa and, increasingly, the Arctic. NATO has a program to work with Mediterranean nations. The alliance is addressing cyber threats and the moral use of artificial intelligence.

The Cold War wasn't won by political parties, but by all Americans and all citizens of NATO countries. The unity of the alliance was important to ending the Cold War, but so was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said.

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949. But there are calls for isolationism — of America going it alone. In an interconnected world, this isn't possible.

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America's greatest asymmetric advantage over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. NATO is the jewel in the crown.

"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our security," Austin said in Brussels. "America's network of allies and partners worldwide — built and sustained by wise administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of World War II — remains a core strategic strength that no rival can match — and that none should doubt."

In August 2024, the U.S. deployed additional warships and fighter jets to the Middle East to support the defense of Israel. The deployments included ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers. (<image:12897>, <image:12898>, <image:12899>)

The BBC ([https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw5y5637eqdo)) and Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pentagon-tells-israel-it-will-adjust-us-troops-middle-east-2024-08-02/)) reported on the deployments.


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. deployed warships to the Middle East in August 2024 to support Israel. However, the evidence does not specify that the warships were en route to the Lebanon coast. Therefore, the claim is partially supported.

The image search results show U.S. Navy warships and aircraft carriers in the Middle East during August 2024. The web search results confirm the deployment of U.S. warships to support Israel in August 2024.

The claim's veracity is uncertain because the evidence does not confirm the warships were specifically en route to the Lebanon coast.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image (<image:55>) shows ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024. The USS Mount Whitney was also present in the image. The image was taken on June 8, 2024, in the Baltic Sea.


## Elaboration
The claim is false. The image depicts ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024.


## Final Judgement
The image shows ships participating in the Baltic Operations 2024 exercise in the Baltic Sea on June 8, 2024, not U.S. warships en route to the Lebanon coast in August 2024. The claim is therefore demonstrably false.

`false`

## Summary



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political wing, was killed by an [explosion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 in his guesthouse in the Iranian capital of Tehran on July 31, 2024. Immediately following the assassination, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a [statement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/31/irans-khamenei-vows-harsh-punishment-for-israel-after-haniyeh-killing)
, “We consider it our duty to avenge his blood in this bitter and difficult incident that happened in the territory of the Islamic Republic.” In April and May 2024, Israel and Iran exchanged long-range strikes in a rare instance of direct confrontation between the two states. As journalist Oz Katerji [put it](https://twitter.com/OzKaterji/status/1818610790108135631)
, “Israel is now just one Sinwar assassination away from being able to declare a ‘victory’ over Hamas in Gaza.”

In this way, Israel’s latest assassination appears to be a calculated risk on behalf of Netanyahu, who very likely personally approved the [operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/01/world/middleeast/how-hamas-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-bomb.html)
 to kill Haniyeh. All rights reserved.

Haniyeh had led Hamas’s political wing since 2017, serving as the group’s public face and overseeing its [finances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/02/hamas-funding-ismail-haniyeh-us-sanctions/)
. Haniyeh was based in Qatar but was visiting Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president when he was killed.

The assassination of Haniyeh is just the latest in a string of Israeli efforts to [hunt down](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-shin-bet-chief-vows-to-kill-hamas-chiefs-in-lebanon-turkey-qatar/)
 members of Hamas’s leadership for their involvement in the group’s attack on October 7, 2023. Still, there is always the risk that serious retaliation from Iran over Haniyeh’s assassination could tip the region into a broader war.

Haniyeh’s death also complicates peace talks over Gaza. In the near term, his assassination will undermine the [recent progress](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/world/middleeast/negotiators-meet-in-rome-to-revive-push-for-hostage-release-and-cease-fire-in-gaza.html)
 made between the two sides. Peace needs serious partners.”

However, in the long term, Haniyeh’s assassination and the killing of other senior Hamas leaders could serve as a path for Israel to reduce its military operations in Gaza. The assassinations of Haniyeh and Deif make this path appear increasingly credible."

Israel will not be invited to a ceremony in Japan commemorating the 1945 atomic bombing of Nagasaki city, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, which cited the city’s mayor Shiro Suzuki.

In June, Suzuki sent a letter to Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, leaving an invitation to the annual peace ceremony on hold due to a risk of “unexpected situations” such as protests, according to Kyodo News.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Suzuki said he had not seen any changes that would lessen those risks ahead of the August 9 ceremony promoting world peace.

Israel’s Ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, described the decision as “regrettable” in a post on X, adding it “sends a wrong message to the world.” 

In contrast, Hiroshima has invited Israel to its annual ceremony on August 6, a decision that’s been controversial with activists and atomic bomb survivors’ groups that say Israel should be excluded this year as Russia and Belarus have been for the past two years over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks after casting his vote for the presidential runoff election on July 5 in Tehran, Iran.

Majid Saeedi/Getty Images/File

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to “strike Israel directly” following the killing of Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran overnight, [according to the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html)
. 

The Times, citing information it said was provided by three Iranian officials familiar with the order, said the directive was given during an emergency meeting for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Wednesday. 

The New York Times said the officials asked not to be named because they did not have the authority to speak publicly. The report did not say how or when any strike would be carried out.

Earlier, Khamenei said it was Iran’s “duty” to avenge Haniyeh’s death since he was killed inside Iran. 

“You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment,” he said in a statement, referring to Israel.

CNN reviewed statements by Hamas and others, in addition to state media outlets and other social media posts, to analyze and track the Islamist militant group leader Ismail Haniyeh’s movements since October 7, 2023.

After he celebrated seeing his fighters return to the Gaza Strip with Israeli equipment in Hamas’ office in Istanbul, Turkey on October 7, Ismail Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Doha as head of Hamas’ Political Bureau but took a number of trips to Tehran, Istanbul and Cairo, according to a CNN analysis.

**Tehran:** Haniyeh took at least four trips to Tehran – in November, March, May and July. During all four visits, he met with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

In May, he attended the funerals of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who were killed in a helicopter crash. 

On his final trip to Tehran, which ended with his assassination, he was attending the inauguration of the new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Cairo:** He also took three known trips to Cairo in November, December and February, to lead Hamas’ ceasefire negotiating delegation. That negotiation process, which is still ongoing, has been shepherded by Qatar and Egypt.  

**Doha:** As war ravaged Gaza, Haniyeh spent the majority of his time in Hamas’ Doha offices. While there, press statements from Hamas indicate he repeatedly met with a number of foreign dignitaries, gave speeches and held meetings.

Doha is also where Haniyeh issued his first statement after his three sons, and four grandchildren were killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike. In that statement from mid-April, he said that such killings will only make Hamas more steadfast in its principles, adding that Hamas will not surrender, will not compromise, no matter how great the sacrifice.

Temporary flight restrictions have been issued in Tehran ahead of a memorial procession on Thursday for assassinated Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.

The notice issued by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation restricts flight movements within a 2-kilometer (0.6-mile) circle radius centered at the University of Tehran.

Flight restrictions will be in place from 6 a.m. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind Haniyeh’s assassination.

“Israel was also pursuing \[a\] political goal with this act, aiming to disrupt the first day of the new government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has prioritized strengthening peace and stability in the region, and enhancing cooperation and constructive engagement with international community,” Iravani added.

Earlier today, US Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”

Wood said that although the US was not involved with Israel’s response on July 30 in Lebanon, “there is no doubt absolutely none that Hezbollah was responsible for this attack, which used an Iranian weapon and was launched from a portion of Lebanon controlled by Hezbollah.”

Wood said Iran has to comply with existing Security Council resolutions or face additional measures. 

Wood also said that “the United States was not aware of or involved in the apparent death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh,” adding that the US has “no independent confirmation as to Hamas’s claims regarding his death.”

A relative of a hostage still being held in Gaza has said it is “hard to see” how the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh will help advance the deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. 

Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded has been held in Gaza since October 7, said that she trusted statements from Qatari meditators on Wednesday warning that Haniyeh’s killing “doesn’t help” the talks between Israel and Hamas. 

She told CNN that her confidence is waning in the ability of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to broker a deal to return the hostages. Lifschitz’s 85-year-old mother was previously released from captivity in Gaza.

Netanyahu’s priority now, according to Lifschitz, is not securing the release of the hostages but rather shoring up his own “political survival.” She said she has “no sympathy” for Netanyahu himself, only for the hostages, their families, and the “innocent civilians caught up in this nightmare.” 

“Our loved ones are not here. In remarks Wednesday, a defiant Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep fighting, saying his country has delivered “crushing blows” to its enemies.

Haniyeh was the second figure of an Iran-backed group assassinated in the past day, following the killing by Israel of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon.

The Al Qassam Brigades said it was “the beginning of a swift response to the cowardly assassination of our great national leader, the martyr Ismail Haniyeh.”

“Hebron will lead the way in carrying out qualitative operations in the coming days, by the will of Allah,” it added.

The Israel Defense Forces said a civilian was in the hospital after being shot at and stabbed northeast of Hebron.

Israel’s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said a 50-year-old man was hospitalized in serious condition after being stabbed on Route 60 near Kiryat Arba, a settlement on the outskirts of Hebron."

By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. <image:13377>

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).  

The Hamas leader had arrived in Tehran earlier this week and had attended events at the parliament and an exhibition near Milad Tower before retiring to his residence.

Neither Hamas nor Iranian officials have yet commented publicly on the incident. <image:13377>

HAMAS USING WHATSAPP TO COLLECT INTELLIGENCE ON IDF MOVEMENTS

Hamas has once again been trying to obtain intelligence from Israeli troops stationed along the Gaza border using online messaging applications.

Posing as fellow soldiers, Hamas operatives contacted troops on the WhatsApp text messaging service and would ask for intelligence such as troop movements.

One combat soldier serving in the Paratrooper’s brigade received a text message on WhatsApp from an unknown person asking him to send the dates of the next exercises the brigade was expecting to hold in the coming months and when the troops were scheduled to leave the area.

Despite the Hamas operative sending the soldier information on the brigade, likely taken from another soldier the operative contacted, the paratrooper did not divulge any intelligence and alerted his commanders.

According to Ynet news, an investigation was launched into how the Hamas operative got his hands on the classified information.

The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit acknowledged the efforts by Hamas to collect intelligence from soldiers, saying in a statement that “The IDF is aware of the enemy’s activity and is following its efforts over social media. According to the army, there have been hundreds of reports of suspicious individuals approaching soldiers online since January 2017.

The military first uncovered Hamas’s attempt to honeypot male soldiers online that January in an operation dubbed “Hunter’s Network,” where dozens of accounts on social networks like Facebook were identified as being operated with false or stolen identities, with the intent to extract classified information from both regular and reservist soldiers.

The IDF’s Military Intelligence Directorate later launched “Operation Heartbreaker” and uncovered another cell behind suspicious online actions targeting soldiers on social networks as well as on messaging applications such as WhatsApp, using Israeli numbers to get soldiers to download applications from Google’s official store.

The military urged troops to only confirm friendship requests from people they know personally, to not upload any classified information to any social network, and to only download applications from the original App Store (rather than downloading applications from links).

Troops were also warned that if they were approached by a stranger online, to be aware that it might be an attempt to honeypot them, especially if the suspicious individual is unable to meet in person.

The IDF has urged all soldiers, including reserve soldiers, to report to their commander and to security officials if the suspicious individual asks them to download applications and if they feel that their phone may have been compromised.

[![](/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/holcoursepopup1.png)](/help-end-antisemitism-2507dmpcp/) We call on all military and civilian personnel to act carefully and responsibly.

“We would like to point out that this year marks the anniversary of Operation Heartbreaker, in which the IDF exposed Hamas activity against IDF soldiers on social networks. The operation contributed greatly to raising the awareness and alertness of the soldiers, which is also reflected in the current event,” the military added.

The IDF recently launched two operations uncovering networks of Hamas operatives trying to lure in soldiers through smartphone applications."

Since the onset of the Gaza conflict, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have focused on high-profile leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as activists and journalists in the region, using artificial intelligence to locate, track, and eliminate targets swiftly.

"With American support, Israel is employing artificial intelligence against its adversaries, from attempts to eliminate Hamas leader \[Ismail\] Haniyeh to targeted operations in Palestine," Khan said.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The provided sources discuss the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, 2024, in Tehran, Iran, attributed to Israel. The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Ismail_Haniyeh)) does not mention any tracking via WhatsApp. The CSIS article ([https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ismail-haniyehs-assassination-escalation-or-ramp)) and the CNN article ([https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/hamas-political-leader-haniyeh-killed-iran-07-31-24)) also report on the assassination, with the CNN article mentioning that Israel has neither confirmed nor denied being behind the assassination. <image:4045>, <image:1>


### Evidence from `web_search`

Sputnik India ([https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html](https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html)) reports that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh. <image:13395> Sputnik Globe published articles about Ismail Haniyeh, including one discussing his assassination in Tehran, but they do not mention tracking via WhatsApp.


## Elaboration
The Sputnik India article ([https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html](https://sputniknews.in/20240807/us-big-tech-guards-israels-operations-in-the-middle-east-7974093.html)) reports that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh. This supports the claim.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals unconfirmed reports and claims from Iranian state media and Sputnik that Israeli intelligence tracked Ismail Haniyeh through WhatsApp. The Sputnik India article specifically mentions that Israel's AI-driven Lavender system monitors WhatsApp and contacts to identify suspects, and some reports suggest that user data was exploited to track Haniyeh.

Based on the available evidence, the claim is supported by reports, although they are unconfirmed. Therefore, the most appropriate decision is `true`.

## Summary

Hunched amidst the rubble in Kahramanmaras, Mesut Hancer is pictured holding the hand of his daughter 15-year-old Irmak – her pale fingers visible through the slabs of concrete and broken bricks that once formed the apartment block where the family lived.

Irmak is still lying on her bed, with what appears to be a pink bedsheet pulled from it to expose the mattress. Around her lies debris – from a sofa cushion to the heavy brick walls, smashed into tiny pieces.

Her father gazes into the distance with a vacant expression, as he sits sat on the rubble of what was once their home.

The earthquake occurred around 4km southeast of Ekinözü in the Kahramanmaraş province, where Mr Hancer and his daughter are pictured. Some of the heaviest devastation occurred between Kahramanmaras and Gaziantep, a city of two million people where entire streets now lie in ruins as snow falls.

Turkish authorities report that 13.5 million people were affected across an area spanning roughly 450km from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.

Another heartbreaking story of loss, the newborn was the only member of her family to survive. She is believed to have been born three hours earlier, according to how far her temperature had plummeted.

Footage of the rescue shows a search team member lifting the dust-covered infant to safety in the small town of Jinderis. Located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria close to the Turkish border, it was hard hit by the quake with multiple buildings destroyed.

The story behind this Turkey earthquake photo that 'many will never forget'
===========================================================================

Turkish father Mesut Hancer wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![A man sitting holding the hand of someone who is beneath rubble.](https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/f96276f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3039x1710+463+624/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2Ff1%2Ff608b67744b0b21f069d8e6188b7%2Fgettyimages-1246861398.jpg&imwidth=1280)

###### KEY POINTS

*   Mesut Hancer was photographed as he held the hand of his daughter who was buried beneath debris.
*   It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing a photographer away, the father called him in.
*   The photo appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world

It was a moment encapsulating the unspeakable pain of the Turkish earthquake: a father holding his 15-year-old's hand, the only thing visible after her body was crushed by concrete.  
  

Mesut Hancer sat alone in the freezing cold on a pile of broken bricks that were once his home, oblivious to the world and overwhelmed by grief.  
  

His daughter, Irmak, was dead. But he refused to let her go, caressing the fingers peeking out from a mattress the girl was asleep on when [the first pre-dawn tremor struck on Monday](/news/article/australia-pledges-10-million-in-aid-to-syria-and-turkey-as-devastating-earthquake-kills-thousands/s7c0xn5y5)
.  
  

There were no rescue teams. Survivors were frantically clawing their way through the rubble to find loved ones, bits of their homes thrown out onto the debris-strewn street.

Bedframes lay on top of shattered balconies. Torn clothes and toys told the tale of lives lost.  
  

It was too late for Irmak, one of nearly 20,000 people confirmed to have died in [the most powerful earthquake to strike Turkey and Syria in nearly a century](/news/article/the-three-reasons-why-the-turkey-syria-earthquake-was-so-devastating/qgetwuxvv)
.  
  

But Adem Altan, a veteran photographer with news agency AFP who rushed to the scene from Ankara, could not take his eyes off the still, silently mourning father.  
  

He trained his camera on Mr Hancer from 60 metres away. It was a delicate moment. But instead of shooing Mr Altan away, the father called him in.  
  

"Take pictures of my child," Mr Hancer called in a low, trembling voice.

### 'I was speechless'

The father wanted the world to see his — and his nation's — grief. And it did.  
  

The AFP photograph appeared on the front pages of major newspapers across the world, including the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal.  
  

"As I took photos, I was so sad. I kept repeating to myself, 'what immense pain'. I couldn't stop myself from crying," Mr Altan recalled.  
  

"I was speechless."  
  

Mr Altan asked Hancer his name and then his daughter's name.

"He was speaking with difficulty, so I could not talk to him too much," Mr Altan said.  
  

Mr Altan could not ask too many questions because everyone needed to observe silence to hear whether there were survivors underneath the rubble.  
  

A photographer for 40 years, including 15 with AFP, Mr Altan knew that the photograph represented Turkey's pain.  
  

But its global impact surprised him. It has been shared hundreds of thousands of times online.  
  

Mr Altan has received thousands of messages from people worldwide, wanting to offer support.  
  

"Many told me they will never forget this image," he said.  

### Hope for more survivors fades

Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday.  
  

The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities.  
  

The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful quake hit northwest Turkey.

A Turkish official said the disaster posed "very serious difficulties" for the holding of an election scheduled for 14 May in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power.  
  

With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead.  
  

The first United Nations convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey.

In Syria's Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: "It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies, last night we couldn't sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad."  
  

Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat.  
  

Some 40 per cent of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkey's Bogazici University.

CNN  — 

It’s been a week since a massive [7.8 magnitude earthquake](https://cnn.com/2023/02/07/middleeast/earthquake-turkey-syria-why-deadly-intl/index.html)
 rocked [Turkey](https://cnn.com/2023/02/11/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-recovery-intl/index.html)
 and [Syria](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/syria-left-behind-earthquake-mime-intl/index.html)
, claiming the lives of more than [36,000](https://cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/turkey-syria-earthquake-updates-2-13-23-intl/index.html)
 people. Many tens of thousands more have been injured. Millions may be left homeless.

Few images have captured the devastation of the past week as starkly as a photograph of Mesut Hancer.

He was photographed holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, under the rubble in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicenter of the quake. He said she died at the moment it hit, with no chance of escape.

In an interview with CNN Turk Saturday, Hancer spoke about the lives behind the image that has come to define last week’s tragic disaster.

Irmak had been visiting her grandmother, Hancer said, and he spent three days trying to free her body from the rubble.

“It was awful. As soon as I heard the news, I rushed there. And with my own bare hands, with my own means, with great effort I tried to pull out my daughter. However, unfortunately, I couldn’t save my daughter,” Hancer said.

“Losing a mother, a father or siblings aside, losing a child is on another level of despair,” he said.

When Hancer arrived at the wreckage, the terrible reality of the situation became apparent.

![Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230207121217-06-earthquake-020723-kahramanmaras-turkey.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)

Seven members of his family ended up under the rubble, Hancer told CNN Turk.

“I didn’t have hope because there was a large girder on my daughter. Her waist up was free but below her waist under the rubble,” she was crushed, he said. “Unfortunately, during the earthquake, she died right there and then. She didn’t have a chance of survival.”

Hancer said he spent three days trying to free his daughter’s body from the rubble.

“With my own effort, with my own means, I reached her. I couldn’t ask anyone \[for help\], because there are a lot of people under the rubble,” he said.

The death toll in Turkey has reached 31,643, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Monday. The confirmed death toll in Syria is 4,574.

[Rescue efforts](https://cnn.com/2023/02/10/middleeast/turkey-syria-earthquake-intl/index.html)
 continue in both countries, but authorities have been overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. More than [5,700 buildings](https://cnn.com/2023/02/08/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-public-anger-intl/index.html)
 in Turkey have collapsed, according to the country’s disaster agency.

“I also talked with AFAD \[the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency in Turkey\], and they helped as much as they could. But they said they could not provide an excavator to that area,” Hancer said.

Hancer is grieving not only for his daughter. The earthquake struck when members of his family had traveled across Turkey to his mother’s house, where his daughter was staying.

“My mother, my two older brothers, my sister-in-law and her little daughter. There were seven people including my daughter. They were all under the rubble,” Hancer said.

Hancer’s home has also been badly damaged, he said, adding that he doesn’t have anywhere to stay. “We cannot enter our house because we don’t have the means. We are left outside.”

Thousands of families are facing similar grief and devastation.

Meanwhile, amid growing public anger over the government’s response to the disaster, Turkish authorities have carried out a wave of arrests of property developers accused of “negligence” over building collapses due to last week’s earthquake.

Published On 16 Jul 202416 Jul 2024

Israel’s military has bombed another United Nations-run school as well as an Israeli-designed “safe-zone” in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 42 Palestinians and wounding dozens of others, according to Palestinian officials.

The Israeli attacks on Tuesday hit the UN’s al-Razi school in the central Nuseirat refugee camp and a main street lined with market stalls in the southern al-Mawasi area, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had sought shelter.

At least 25 people were killed in al-Razi while 17 were killed in al-Mawasi, Gaza’s Government Media Office said. More than 70 people were wounded in the attacks.

A third Israeli attack on Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza also killed five more Palestinians, officials said.

The bombing of al-Razi is the sixth Israeli attack on schools affiliated with the UN and its agencies in the past 10 days.

Video footage verified by Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency Sanad showed a young man carrying what appear to be remnants of the rockets that targeted the school.

“I cannot describe the scene from the horror of the bombing,” he said.

Among those killed was local journalist Mohammad Meshmesh. They followed one of the deadliest weeks in the Gaza Strip since the war began, with at least 470 people killed between July 9 and July 15.

The deaths include at least 90 people who were killed in an Israeli attack on al-Mawasi on Saturday. His death takes the number of journalists killed in the conflict to 160, the Gaza Government Media Office said.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, describes chaotic scenes inside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital on Tuesday following the arrival of people wounded in the school attack.

“The Israeli attack on al-Razi middle school in the heart of the camp – such a busy area – happened during a rush hour when the streets around the overcrowded school were full of people,” Mahmoud said.

‘Nowhere is safe’
-----------------

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Israeli forces have hit nearly 70 percent of its schools in Gaza since the war began last October.

“Over 95% of these schools were used as shelters when hit. The blatant disregard for UN premises and humanitarian law must stop.”

Hamas issued a statement denouncing Israel’s “deliberate bombing of displaced people in UNRWA’s al-Razi School in the Nuseirat camp, and the al-Mawasi area west of the city of Khan Younis, which was declared a safe area”.

“This is a brutal and shameful act that is a scar on humanity,” the group said, reiterating that staunch Israel ally, the United States, was complicit in the “genocide” in Gaza.

The air attacks on Tuesday came even as Israel’s military has pulled back or scaled down ground offensives in the north and south. Israel said it was targeting two senior commanders in the military wing of Hamas, including Mohammed Deif, but said it could not confirm if he had indeed been killed in the attack.

Israeli forces have repeatedly struck al-Mawasi despite designating the coastal area a “safe-zone” and ordering Palestinians fleeing ground assaults to take refuge there.

The relentless bombardments come also as Israel and Hamas continue to weigh the latest ceasefire proposal. Hamas has said talks aimed at halting the nine-month-long war would continue, even after Israel targeted Deif.

Israel has said it will continue pursuing Hamas fighters who are hiding among civilians after offensives uprooted underground tunnel networks.

At least 38,713 people have been killed and 89,166 wounded in Israel’s war on Gaza since October 7. The death toll in Israel from the Hamas-led attacks on October 7 is estimated at 1,139, and dozens of people are still held captive in Gaza.

*   Peace talks end in Qatar and Egypt with no agreement
*   Some Gaza City residents ignore order to head south
*   Other Gazans reported trapped in their homes

CAIRO/GAZA, July 11 (Reuters) - Israel rained bombs on Gaza City during a week that residents described as comparable to the fiercest battle of the war, while a Palestinian Islamic Jihad official on Thursday said a [new round of peace talks](/world/middle-east/gaza-talks-making-some-progress-differences-remain-egyptian-sources-say-2024-07-11/)
 ended with no agreements yet.

Israel has been [bombarding the Gaza Strip for 10 months](https://www.reuters.com/world/israel-hamas/)
 in a war that has laid waste to the territory and killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to medical authorities in Gaza.

On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least six people in Gaza City and 19 in the rest of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian authorities. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here," said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.

**\[1/5\]**Displaced Palestinian children, who fled north Gaza after they were ordered by Israeli army to move southward, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, travel in a car as they arrive in Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip, July 11, 2024. The head of Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency was headed to Cairo to pursue the negotiations, Netanyahu's office said.

In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said many details still need to be hammered out to secure a deal.

In its statement on Thursday, Hamas accused Israel of "stalling to buy time to foil this round of negotiations, as it has done in previous rounds", all of which have ended in failure since a week-long truce in November.

As [peace talks dragged](/pictures/ruins-gaza-diplomacy-falters-2024-06-13/)
 on, Gaza City residents endured a fierce night of bombing.

Home to more than a quarter of Gaza's residents before the war, Gaza City was largely razed to the ground in late 2023, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. Some posted a hashtag on social media: "We are not leaving".

Asked by Reuters to comment on its operations in Gaza City, the Israeli military said in a statement its forces were working to dismantle Hamas capabilities, and that it "follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm." It said the same was not true of Hamas.

Critics have accused Israel of [committing genocide against Palestinians](/world/middle-east/un-expert-says-israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-calls-arms-embargo-2024-03-26/)
, which Israel denies. It characterizes its actions as self-defense, though the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in January to take action to [prevent acts of genocide](/world/middle-east/key-takeaways-world-court-decision-israei-genocide-case-2024-01-26/)
.

Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.

An Israeli military report on Thursday acknowledged that it had [failed to protect the citizens](/world/middle-east/israeli-military-presents-first-probe-into-its-oct-7-security-failings-2024-07-11/)
 of one of the worst hit communities, Kibbutz Be'eri, where more than 100 people were killed.

PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS CALL FOR WAR TO END
-----------------------------------------

The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which accepted that a truce could begin and some hostages be released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.

Just east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive.

The territory's main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. The civil emergency service said the bodies of at least 30 Palestinians killed in the previous three days also laid scattered on unreachable roads in Gaza City.

The latest round of peace talks ended with no agreements, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Palestinian militant group Hamas of making demands that contradicted a framework deal brokered by Washington. Netanyahu did not say what those demands were.

In a statement, the Palestinian Islamist militant group said mediators had yet to provide it with updates on the state of the talks since it made concessions last week in response to a U.S.-backed Israeli peace offer.

Washington is pushing for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar to end the Gaza war, now in its 10th month.

Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.

"The occupation (Israel) bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God's will."

The Israeli army told Gaza City residents on Wednesday to use two "safe routes" to head south."

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

The attack, which occurred early Saturday morning on Shabbat and coincided with the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, is being called “Israel’s 9/11” and is the deadliest day in Israel in 50 years. Gal Gadot, Madonna, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Natalie Portman, Andy Cohen, Jamie Lee Curtis, Debra Messing, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, Kris Jenner, Mindy Kaling and Meghan McCain are among the celebrities who have taken to social media to stand alongside Israel.

Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have donated $1 million to help children in Israel and Gaza, sources tell _Variety_.

“I stand with Israel you should too,” [Gadot posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyHF5n1t322/)
. “The growing loss of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives is heart wrenching as this war escalates to immense proportions.”

 on her Instagram showing footage of rockets and slain bodies on the streets of Israel. Nine American citizens are among the climbing death toll.

### Popular on Variety

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”

Rabat – A disturbing leaked video came to light on Tuesday showing an Israeli police dog brutally attacking an elderly Palestinian woman inside her home during their raid of the Jabalia refugee camp several weeks ago.

The **[footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8rTeL6pF3M/?igsh=MWRhbzlyYm00Zjl4Ng==)
**, which was obtained by Al Jazeera, has sparked social media fury and widespread condemnation. Captured from a camera mounted on the dog, the video showed the 66-year-old woman screaming in terror as she was viciously attacked.

The elderly woman, identified as Dawlat Al Tanani, suffered severe injuries and fractures as a result of the brutal attack.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, she said that Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) unleashed the dog on her because she was resisting eviction from her home.

“I refuse to be forced out of my house, nor will I abandon my home. So the Israelis set a dog on me, which bit me while I was sleeping in my bed. It dragged me and pulled me all the way to the entrance door,” the elderly woman said.

“Now I have a serious injury. There are no hospitals or anything to treat my injury. My hand is still untreated,” she added.

The incident has reinforced accusations against the IOF of perpetrating severe forms of torture and violence against civilians, contrasting sharply with its self-proclaimed status as “the most moral army in the world.”

Social media users have widely shared the video, expressing shock for the extent the IOF goes to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinians.

Many activists have pointed out that such actions, including the use of police dogs against civilians, have been a longstanding practice by the Israeli forces.

“Israel/Zionist Occupiers brutality clearly has no limits…training dogs to rape and attack Palestinians. The daily massacres (are) getting (more) gruesome by the day,” **[said](https://x.com/huda54112445811/status/1805989054044938370)

The IDF on Thursday refuted accusations that one of its canines attacked an old woman in Gaza. Qatar-based Al Jazeera published menacing photos showing the dog in an aggressive attack of the seemingly terrified resident of Jabaliya.

The military said one of its dogs was abducted by terrorists during the fighting in Gaza and was in their custody when the alleged attack occurred. It was later found killed and his body boobytrapped to explode on soldiers if they attempted to retrieve it.

A Paratrooper Division in search of terrorists sent the attack dog with its handler into a building where they were thought to be hiding. The dog did not return, nor were there sounds of struggle or explosions, the military told ynet. The troops set out to inspect the building remotely using drones. At first, the dog was nowhere to be found but it was later seen sprawled on the street.

The team managed to identify residual explosives coming from the dog's body. The explosives were removed from the dog, which was taken for burial in the canine cemetery in the Canine unit - Oketz base.

The footage published by Al-Jazeera includes segments from the camera installed on the dog, showing it attacking the elderly woman in her home. She appears to be struggling with the dog on her bed.

However, the IDF said that even though the dog shown in the video was indeed a member of the canine unit, it had been abducted by Hamas with its equipment.

"The incident occurred after the handler lost touch with his dog," the IDF said. "It never received orders to harm civilians." The military added that killing the dog and rigging its body was part of Hamas' cynical tactics.

The footage was passed on to Al-Jazeera by correspondent Anas Al Sharif, who covers the northern Gaza area and is affiliated with Hamas. He is a resident of Jabaliya whose home was bombed in an IDF attack, and his father was killed. He is known to accompany Hamas terrorists and document their battles in Jabaliya.

More than 100 dogs were deployed alongside Israeli forces during the aggression in Gaza that began in October 2023.

These dogs, part of the Oketz unit, have been lauded for their roles in military operations, with their stories often celebrated in Israeli media, just as stories of fallen or injured soldiers are shared.

But the celebration of these "warriors on four legs" glosses over the brutal reality of their involvement in the conflict.

Dogs from the Oketz unit played a key role in military raids, such as the attack on 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani in Jabalia camp, where one of the unit’s dogs savagely mauled her.

Another horrific incident occurred when a dog fatally attacked 24-year-old Mohammed Salah Bahar, a young man with Down syndrome, in his home in Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood.

History of Training
-------------------

The Oketz unit, known for its specialized training of attack dogs, has been increasingly deployed in operations against Palestinian civilians and prisoners.

Their role, however, has extended beyond Gaza. The dogs have reportedly been used in Israeli prisons, and there have been disturbing allegations of their involvement in torture.

A prisoner named Muhammad Arab, held in the Sde Teiman prison, reported that dogs were trained to assault detainees sexually, adding another layer of brutality to the treatment of prisoners under Israeli occupation.

The use of military dogs in this context is not new, but its intensification reflects a broader pattern of violence.

Since before the Nakba in 1948, dogs have played a role in the Zionist project’s colonial control over Palestinians.

The glorification of these "warriors on all fours" in Israeli media serves to mask their role in the ongoing suppression of Palestinians, a history that traces back decades and continues to evolve in the current conflict.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, military dogs were notably absent from the Israeli army's ranks, even as Jewish settlers brought new European breeds to Palestine in the wake of “Israel’s” establishment.

In 1974, the Israeli Occupation discreetly revived its military dog unit, although it remained largely secret for more than a decade.

This renewed focus on dogs was closely tied to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which began in 1967.

As Israeli forces faced growing resistance from Palestinian guerrilla fighters, the army saw a need for trained dogs to assist with intelligence and counterinsurgency missions.

Unit 7142, the newly reconstituted dog unit, played a key role in supporting Military Intelligence Unit 269, later known as Sayeret Matkal, one of the Israeli occupation's most elite special forces units.

Trained dogs were deployed to assist in countering what the Israeli occupation referred to as "terrorist activity," which in practice often meant confronting Palestinian guerrillas.

Despite its early successes, Israeli military leadership remained divided on the effectiveness of military dogs. Unit 7142 continued to operate under the radar, with doubts about the "colonial dog" and its utility in official army units lingering within the higher ranks.

Weaponizing Dogs
----------------

Since the Israeli aggression on Gaza began on October 7, more than 100 dogs have played an integral role in Israeli operations in Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, dogs from this unit have worked alongside Israeli paratroopers and other forces.

According to a report by Yoav Zitun on the Ynet website, over 30 dogs from the unit have been killed, many due to explosives or gunfire.

Despite these losses, the unit’s size is expected to double in the coming years, as the army recognizes the tactical value of the dogs in Gaza.

The Oketz unit employs dogs equipped with advanced technology for both military operations and acts of retaliation.

On the battlefield, these dogs are trained to alert soldiers to potential dangers, such as explosives, and to scout sites like destroyed buildings or displaced homes.

One of their key roles is the detection of tunnels used by Palestinian resistance fighters. Equipped with cameras and eavesdropping devices, these dogs are often sent into tunnels ahead of human troops.

Sometimes, they even carry gas bombs that are triggered if the dog detects someone inside, turning the animal into a sacrificial tool.

Yet beyond these security functions, the dogs have also been deployed in brutal retaliatory actions.

The unit uses attack dogs—specifically trained German Shepherds and Dobermanns—whose role is to maul and kill humans.

There have been numerous reports of dogs attacking civilians, including graphic accounts of an elderly woman, Dawlat al-Tanani, in Jabalia camp, whose chest was torn apart by a military dog.

Testimonies from Gaza also describe how these dogs have been used as tools of psychological terror.

According to Fadi, a detainee released from the Sde Teiman camp, Israeli soldiers forced prisoners to endure sexual assaults by trained dogs.

Fadi’s testimony is one of many that highlight the level of dehumanization experienced by Palestinians during the war, with trained dogs playing a central role in this violence.

The story of a booby-trapped dog further underscores the grim interplay between human and canine sacrifice in this conflict.

This militarization of dogs in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict represents a deeper level of brutality, as these animals are used not only for tactical purposes but also as instruments of terror and revenge.![Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg (1600×1000)](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/01/Israeli-reservists-pose-with-a-dog-they-brought-out-of-Gaza-in-December-2023.-Courtesy-of-Glass-Walls.jpg)

Striking Violations
-------------------

Last week, the Israeli newspaper _Haaretz_ released disturbing footage from Megiddo Prison, revealing scenes of abuse against Palestinian prisoners.

In the leaked video, inmates in the prison’s security wing were shown lying on the ground, hands bound, as a guard walked over them with a dog, an apparent act of humiliation.

The use of dogs as a tool for abuse has been a longstanding concern for human rights groups.

In June, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report highlighting the Israeli military’s deployment of police dogs in the Gaza Strip.

According to the report, these dogs are used not only in military operations but also to terrorize prisoners, subjecting them to mauling and, in some instances, sexual violence.

The organization documented numerous cases of dog attacks on civilians during Israeli raids, particularly on homes, hospitals, and shelters.

In some operations, the dogs are equipped with surveillance cameras to scout locations ahead of Israeli soldiers.

Civilians are often left defenseless as the dogs are set upon them, with soldiers standing by or even encouraging the attacks. This behavior has drawn international condemnation.

Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, has called such actions "serious violations" of “Israel's legal obligations toward protected persons under the law of occupation.”

One particularly harrowing case involved Mohammed Bahar, a 24-year-old Palestinian man with Down syndrome.

During a military raid on Gaza’s Shuja’iyya neighborhood last July, a police dog attacked Bahar as he sat on a couch.

His mother recounted the brutal incident to Anadolu Agency, describing how the dog bit her son multiple times, causing fatal injuries.

In another incident from May, widely shared on social media, a police dog attacked 70-year-old Dawlat al-Tanani during an Israeli military operation in Jabalia camp, severely injuring her arm.

Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has also documented the use of dogs in assaults on hospitals, including one attack in 2023 where dogs were unleashed on displaced civilians and even the bodies of the deceased. Another documented case occurred during an invasion of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex in March 2024.

The practice of using police dogs has not been limited to Gaza. In the West Bank, reports indicate a growing number of incidents in which dogs have been deployed during arrests and house raids, particularly against children.

WAFA, the Palestinian News Agency, has shared dozens of photos and videos showing soldiers setting dogs on civilians.

Human rights groups have labeled these attacks as a form of torture and degrading treatment, prohibited under international law.

Protests against this practice have spread beyond the region. On September 16, activists in the Netherlands demonstrated outside a K-9 training center in Oosterhout, demanding a halt to the export of police dogs to the Israeli military, which they claim are being used to target civilians.

The ongoing use of dogs in military operations has become a symbol of the broader human rights concerns surrounding Israel’s occupation, adding to the mounting calls for international accountability.

![Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog](/cached_uploads/resize/400/200/alhaq_files/images/stories/Images/Israeli-Army-Attack-with-Dog.jpg "An archived photo for illustration purposes of an Israeli army dog attacking  a Palestinian woman during an army raid in the West Bank village of Obadiyah, near Bethlehem. During last week, a woman and her 17-year-old son were attacked during an arrest operation.

### Amira Rahman ‘Awad

On 21 December, Israeli occupying forces unleashed an army dog on 47-year-old Amira Rahman ‘Awad during a raid on her sons’ house in Ithna, Hebron. In some cases, computers, documents and money are “confiscated” and furniture is destroyed.

House raids are also used by Israel as tactics of harassment, as was the case during the week of 14 – 20 November when the Israeli army raided the houses of Palestinian ex-prisoners to let them know they were being watched. The soldiers then called on Amira’s 17-year-old son Jarallah who went inside the house to put more clothes on.

Moments after the door to the house was wide open, the Israeli soldiers let loose an army dog described by Amira as being big and similar looking to a wolf. His demands were dismissed and no names were given to him.

Amira’s son Samer was released the next day at around 3:30 pm.

This week alone, tens of houses were raided during arrest operations in Jenin refugee camp and the village of Yatma, south of Nablus.

The arbitrary arrest and detention of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory continues to infringe upon their human rights. The events took place at around 1:20 am when Israeli soldiers stormed into Amira’s house and threatened to bombard her sons’ house located across from hers. According to Amira, the soldiers came to arrest her eldest son Samer Issa ‘Awad (24 years old) who had served an eight-year sentence in an Israeli prison for being an active member of Hamas.

Issa Muhammad ‘Awad, Amira’s husband told the soldiers that his son Samer was sick but will be right down nonetheless."

[Israel's war on Gaza](/topics/israel-war-gaza)

An Israeli army dog mauled a pregnant Palestinian woman.  

In December, Tel Aviv University shared a video on social media revealing the establishment of an “engineering war room” on its campus to support Israeli military operations.

The facility has been developing technologies for the army, including a live-streaming system for [dog-mounted cameras](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tel-aviv-university-developed-dog-cameras-army-unit-linked-gaza-attacks)
 used by canine units linked to deadly attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

The video highlighted the university’s collaboration with hundreds of academics and students serving as reservists in the Israeli military.

In July, MEE reported the death of a [Palestinian with Down syndrome](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/gaza-palestinian-down-syndrome-left-die-israeli-soldiers-after-combat-dog-attack)
 who was attacked by an Israeli combat dog in Gaza City and left to die by Israeli soldiers. More about MEE can be found [here](https://middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye)

While lying in bed after her night prayers, she was suddenly attacked by an Israeli army dog, which stormed into her room and bit deeply into her arm.

This incident occurred during a 20-day attack by the Israeli military on the camp from May 12 to May 31.

Recounting her ordeal to Anadolu, the elderly woman said: "As I was drifting off to sleep, the dog wearing a camera on its back entered the room and attacked me. **Please contact us for subscription options.**](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/p/subscription/1001)

[###### Morning Briefing: Aug. The footage, which quickly went viral, sparked outrage among social media activists.

The Geneva-based civil society organization Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on Thursday condemned the systematic use of trained dogs by the Israeli military to attack Palestinian civilians and detainees.

In a statement, Euro-Med said this is one of the Israeli army’s many crimes of systematic violence against Palestinian detainees, including sexual harassment, and threats of rape.

They documented numerous incidents where Israeli forces used large police and military dogs during raids on homes, hospitals, and shelters, often mocking civilians as the dogs attacked them.

The statement also emphasized that al-Tanani’s case is not isolated, with many similar incidents occurring in Gaza. We need aid to be allowed in," she said.

This attack drew widespread condemnation after Al Jazeera broadcast a video of the incident on Tuesday, showing Israeli forces unleashing a trained dog on a sleeping woman. She was eventually noticed by a young man near al-Yemen al-Saeed Hospital in Jabalia, who helped her get to the hospital for treatment.

The elderly woman expressed her hope for the end of Israeli attacks on Gaza, entry of aid into the region, and return to normalcy.

**“Israeli Military Dog Attacked Me While Asleep and Viciously Bit My Shoulder”**

Dawlat ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani (58) from northern Gaza’s refugee camps

I live on the ground floor in a 90-sqm 3-story house belonging to my brother, Maher ‘Abdullah Mohammed al-Tanani. Only few minutes later at around 22:00, I heard the Israeli soldiers exploding the house fence overlooking Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani’s house and suddenly an Israeli military dog raided the house and attacked me while I was asleep in my bed.  The leaked video was captured by a camera mounted onto the dog.

Your email address will not be published.  I was crying and screaming so loud while I could hear the Israeli soldiers outside the room laughing and mocking me in Hebrew because the dog mauled me.  Last May, the Israeli Occupying Forces (IOF) moved into Jabalia Refugee Camp, so my brother fled with his family to another area due to the brutal and indiscriminate bombardment on Jabalia.  However, I refused to leave and stayed home alone, and there is our neighbor and relative, Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani (60), who lives next-door with his 22-year-old son, Mohammed Jaber ‘Atiyah al-Tanani.

During the incursion, Jaber and his son came to stay with me in the house because I was all alone; they arrived at 10:00 on Tuesday, 14 May 2024.   We all stayed in the same room while hearing the Israeli brutal bombardment in our area amid the harrowing roaring of nearby Israeli military vehicles and tanks.  The dog viciously bit my shoulder and hands and broke my right shoulder’s skin until his teeth reached my shoulder’s bone and fractured it.  I could not defend myself and push the dog off, so it dragged me all the way outside the room."
