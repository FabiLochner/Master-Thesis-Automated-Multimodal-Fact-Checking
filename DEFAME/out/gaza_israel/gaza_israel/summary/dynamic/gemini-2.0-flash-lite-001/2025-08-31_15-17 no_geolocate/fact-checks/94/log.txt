Useful result: From [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/9/british-surgeon-israeli-bombing-far-more-direct-hits-on-people-in-gaza): 
Content: Al Jazeera published an article on June 9, 2025, featuring an image of a child injured in Gaza <image:7416>.

The claim '<image:61> This image shows a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024. She was holding her sister's oxygen mask inside the ambulance. She had already passed away, yet her hand remained on the mask firmly.' is false.
Justification: The claim cannot be verified. Multiple search attempts, including reverse image search, web searches, and image searches, did not yield any information to support the claim that the image depicts a Palestinian girl in the Gaza war in July 2024 holding her sister's oxygen mask.

So, the overall veracity is: false
