## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, on the Polish government's decision to guarantee safe passage to Netanyahu, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant and that Netanyahu was not planning to attend. <image:k> <image:k>


## Elaboration
The provided evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was considering protecting Netanyahu from potential arrest by the ICC. This is related to an arrest warrant and the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. However, the evidence does not mention any missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified with the available information. The evidence focuses on events in January 2025 and does not provide any details about Netanyahu's whereabouts or actions in October 2024.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
On October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel, codenamed "Operation True Promise II" according to a Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)). ![image 1](media/0.jpg) The attack was in retaliation for Israeli actions, including the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) and Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) also reported on the attack. ![image 281](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-334464.jpg) ![image 282](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-506528.jpg) Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake" according to the Wikipedia article and Al Jazeera. ![image 1](media/0.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the attack, calling it a "big mistake." However, the evidence does not mention Netanyahu leaving Israel or fleeing to Poland.

Therefore, the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland amid the missile attack on October 1, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu responded to the attack. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on that date.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Iran did launch a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, as reported by sources like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel), there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.
