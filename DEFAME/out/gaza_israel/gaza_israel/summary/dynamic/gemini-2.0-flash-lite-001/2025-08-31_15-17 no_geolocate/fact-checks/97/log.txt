Content: Fox LA published an article discussing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes a measure automatically registering men aged 18 to 26 for selective service. The article mentions that the Pentagon has sent military advisors to Israel. <image:13438>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/will-the-military-draft-come-back): 
Content: The Military.com article states that there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024. It mentions discussions about a national service mandate but notes that Donald Trump called it a "ridiculous idea." The article also outlines the legal framework for reinstating the draft, which would require a declaration of national emergency or a large-scale war. It also mentions that despite online rumors, there is currently no plan or indication that a draft will be reinstated.

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.ngaus.org/newsroom/report-us-not-prepared-conduct-military-draft): 
Content: The National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) published a report on June 25, 2024, stating that the U.S. is not prepared to conduct a military draft. The report mentions that the U.S. ended conscription in 1973 but that all U.S. males ages 18 to 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System. <image:1>

The claim 'The US reinstituted draft in 2024 for the Israel-Hamas war.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. While the US requires registration for selective service, and the Pentagon has sent military advisors to Israel, there are no current plans to reactivate the draft in 2024, according to sources like [Military.com](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/will-the-military-draft-come-back).

So, the overall veracity is: false
