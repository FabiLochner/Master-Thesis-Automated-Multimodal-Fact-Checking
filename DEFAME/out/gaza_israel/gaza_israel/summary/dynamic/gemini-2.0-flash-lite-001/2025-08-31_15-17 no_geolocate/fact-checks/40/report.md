### Evidence from `web_search`
In 1936, Robert Burke was expelled from Columbia University for leading an anti-Nazi protest. According to the Wikipedia article "Student activism at Columbia University" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism_at_Columbia_University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism_at_Columbia_University)), Burke led a rally to protest Columbia's relationship with the Nazis.

The article from Blurred Bylines ([https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/](https://blurredbylines.com/articles/robert-burke-columbia-university-expulsion-1936-protest/)) states that Burke was expelled on June 16, 1936, and the article from Medium ([https://medium.com/@blurredbylines/when-columbia-university-expelled-robert-burke-for-anti-nazi-protests-in-1936-d9f236c91794](https://medium.com/@blurredbylines/when-columbia-university-expelled-robert-burke-for-anti-nazi-protests-in-1936-d9f236c91794)) also confirms this, adding that Burke was the president-elect of his junior class and a leading member of the American Student Union. The Medium article also references a document titled "The Dismissal of Bob Burke. Heidelberg Comes to Columbia" (![image 6154](media/2025-08-29_19-44-1756496651-114181.jpg), ![image 6158](media/2025-08-29_19-44-1756496662-914123.jpg)).
