Useful result: From [Source](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250806-grok-is-that-gaza-ai-image-checks-mislocate-news-photographs): 
Content: The France24 article, published on August 6, 2025, discusses how AI tools misidentified an image of a starving Gazan girl. The image, taken by AFP photojournalist Omar al-Qattaa, shows nine-year-old Mariam Dawwas in the arms of her mother in Gaza City on August 2, 2025. The AI chatbot Grok incorrectly identified the photo as being taken in Yemen in 2018. <image:1>

The claim '<image:3> This is an authentic image of a mother holding the bones of her son in Gaza in March 2025. After more than a year and a half of searching for him under the rubble of their bombed-out house.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the search results confirm the existence of images related to the Gaza conflict, the origin and authenticity of the specific image in the claim remain unclear, and AI tools have been shown to misidentify images ([France24](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250806-grok-is-that-gaza-ai-image-checks-mislocate-news-photographs)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
