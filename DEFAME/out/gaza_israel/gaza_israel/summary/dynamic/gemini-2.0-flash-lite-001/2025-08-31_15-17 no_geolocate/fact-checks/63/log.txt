Useful result: From [Source](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/): Found exact image on website with title: Image of two mummified children in a Bolivian museum goes viral as ...
Content: The website kashif.ps published an article on April 14, 2025, stating that the image in the claim is of two mummified children in a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza. The image was posted on Flickr in 2006 and shows mummified Spanish children from the 1800s. <image:8139>, <image:8140>.

The claim '<image:38> This image shows two children in Gaza in April 2025 found dead under the rubble of their home two months after an Israeli airstrike destroyed it.' is false.
Justification: The claim is false. The image in the claim depicts mummified children from a Bolivian museum, not children found in Gaza after an Israeli airstrike. This was confirmed by a reverse image search, which identified the image and its origin ([https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/](https://kashif.ps/en/index.php/2025/04/14/image-of-two-mummified-children-in-a-bolivian-museum-goes-viral-as-from-gaza/)).
