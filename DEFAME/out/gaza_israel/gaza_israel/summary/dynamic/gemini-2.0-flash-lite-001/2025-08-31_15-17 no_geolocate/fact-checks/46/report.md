## Elaboration
1.  U2 has a tour in Las Vegas in 2024.
2.  Bob Geldof has collaborated with U2's Bono in the past.
3.  There is no evidence of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army.

**Insufficient Information:** The claim cannot be verified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence indicates that U2 has a tour in Las Vegas in 2024, and Bob Geldof has collaborated with U2's Bono in the past. However, there is no evidence of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available information.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is not supported by the available evidence. While U2 has a tour in 2024, and Bob Geldof has collaborated with U2's Bono in the past, there is no evidence of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. In fact, a Dublin Live article from November 2024, suggests criticism of Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)).
