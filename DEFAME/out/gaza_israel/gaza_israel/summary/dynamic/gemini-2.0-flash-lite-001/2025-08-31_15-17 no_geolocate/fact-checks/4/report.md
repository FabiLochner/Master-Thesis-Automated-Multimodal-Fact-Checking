### Evidence from `web_search`
The Guardian reported on December 22, 2024, that the U.S. launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen in response to Houthi attacks on U.S. navy warships and merchant vessels. The article also mentions that Israel launched strikes against ports and energy infrastructure in Houthi-held parts of Yemen.

Al Jazeera reported on December 21, 2024, that the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The strikes targeted a missile storage facility and a command-and-control site. The Houthis launched a missile at central Israel, which fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area.

## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 21 and 22, 2024. The strikes were in response to Houthi attacks on U.S. navy warships and merchant vessels, as well as a missile launch towards Israel. The image's origin is not confirmed.

The claim that the U.S. was bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024, is supported by the evidence. However, the claim that the strikes were in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital is partially supported. The evidence indicates that the Houthis launched a missile at central Israel, but it does not explicitly state that the U.S. strikes were a direct reprisal for this specific attack.

The image's origin is not confirmed.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 21 and 22, 2024. The strikes were in response to Houthi attacks on U.S. navy warships and merchant vessels, as well as a missile launch towards Israel. The claim that the U.S. was bombarding Yemen on December 22, 2024, is supported by the evidence. However, the claim that the strikes were in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital is partially supported. The evidence indicates that the Houthis launched a missile at central Israel, but it does not explicitly state that the U.S. strikes were a direct reprisal for this specific attack.

The claim is partially accurate as the U.S. did conduct airstrikes on Yemen on December 22, 2024. However, the claim that the strikes were in reprisal after Yemen launched an attack on Israel's capital is not fully supported by the evidence. Therefore, the claim is `false`.

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is partially accurate. The U.S. did conduct airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on December 22, 2024, as reported by sources like [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/us-launches-airstrikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemen) and [Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/21/us-says-conducted-strikes-against-houthi-targets-in-yemens-capital). However, while the strikes were in response to Houthi attacks, the evidence does not explicitly confirm they were a direct reprisal for an attack on Israel's capital.
