The claim 'In November 2024, rock band U2 and singer Bob Geldof announced a multi-stadium tour to aid the Israeli army.' is false.
Justification: The claim is not supported by the available evidence. While U2 has a tour in 2024, and Bob Geldof has collaborated with U2's Bono in the past, there is no evidence of a tour by U2 and Bob Geldof to aid the Israeli army. In fact, a Dublin Live article from November 2024, suggests criticism of Bono and Geldof for their silence on the situation in Gaza ([https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394](https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/celebs/music-legend-hits-out-bono-30287394)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
