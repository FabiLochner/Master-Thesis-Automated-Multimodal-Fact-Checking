## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 8](media/8.jpg) is found on two websites. One website, Syria Live Map, uses the image in an article about an attack on the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024, and also provides news about the Syrian civil war and a map of the conflict. The other website, News Live - Oregon, also uses the image and provides news about events in Oregon, including police investigations, fires, and shootings, with dates ranging from June 17, 2025, to July 10, 2025. The image ![image 649](media/2025-07-18_21-23-1752873823-228030.jpg) is also found on Harapan Daily, in an article titled "Middle East on the brink: Gaza, Israel, Iran", which discusses the Israeli aggression against Gaza, the role of the United States and the West, and the Iranian factor.


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that the image has been used in different contexts. Syria Live Map used the image in an article about an attack on the Al-Laylaki area on October 22, 2024. News Live - Oregon used the image in articles about events in Oregon in 2025. Harapan Daily used a similar image in an article about the Middle East.

The claim states that the image shows Israel launching attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024. The evidence does not support this claim. The image was used in articles about events in Syria and Oregon, and a similar image was used in an article about the Middle East.

The claim is not supported by the evidence.


## Final Judgement
The image has been used in different contexts, including articles about events in Syria and Oregon, and a similar image was used in an article about the Middle East. The claim that the image shows Israel launching attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the evidence.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image in question has been used in various contexts, including articles about events in Syria and Oregon, and a similar image was used in an article about the Middle East. The claim that the image depicts Israeli attacks on Iranian military targets on October 26, 2024, is not supported by the available evidence.
