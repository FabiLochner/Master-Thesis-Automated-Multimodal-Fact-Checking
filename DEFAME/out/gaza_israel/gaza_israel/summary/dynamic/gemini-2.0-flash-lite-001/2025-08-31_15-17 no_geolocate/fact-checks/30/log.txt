Content: The search result from NDTV.com discusses the Bibas family, who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023. The article mentions that Hamas claimed that Shiri Bibas and her two sons are no longer alive, while Israeli authorities have not confirmed this. The article includes an image of the Bibas family. <image:21> The article was published on December 4, 2023.
