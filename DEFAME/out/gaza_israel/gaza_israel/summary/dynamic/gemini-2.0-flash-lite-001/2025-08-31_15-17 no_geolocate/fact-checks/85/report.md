## Actions
```
reverse_search(![image 54](media/85.jpg))
```

## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image ![image 54](media/85.jpg) appears in articles from The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/channel-12-poll-shows-liberman-still-holds-the-key-to-netanyahus-next-coalition/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/channel-12-poll-shows-liberman-still-holds-the-key-to-netanyahus-next-coalition/)) and Haaretz ([https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/yigal-amir-0000017f-da25-d718-a5ff-faa5f9030000](https://www.haaretz.com/ty-tag/yigal-amir-0000017f-da25-d718-a5ff-faa5f9030000)). The AAP ([https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/digital-manipulation-distorts-israeli-tv-poll/](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/digital-manipulation-distorts-israeli-tv-poll/)) fact-checked the image and found it to be digitally manipulated. The original poll, from May 2022, asked about the government's reliance on terrorist supporters.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that the image is a screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12. However, the AAP fact-checked the image and found it to be digitally manipulated. The original poll's question was different from the one presented in the image.

Therefore, the claim that the image shows an authentic question about a soldier being allowed to rape a prisoner is false.


## Final Judgement
The image is a screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, but it has been digitally manipulated. The original poll's question was different from the one presented in the image.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The image is a screenshot of a poll from Israel's Channel 12, but it has been digitally manipulated. The original poll's question was different from the one presented in the image, as confirmed by the AAP fact-check ([https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/digital-manipulation-distorts-israeli-tv-poll/](https://www.aap.com.au/factcheck/digital-manipulation-distorts-israeli-tv-poll/)).
