## Elaboration
The Jerusalem Post ([https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443](https://www.jpost.com/omg/article-824443)) reported on false rumors of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death following a Hezbollah drone attack on October 13, 2024. The evidence indicates that a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, on an Israeli army base, resulting in casualties.

The claim that Herzi Halevi was assassinated is false, as the Jerusalem Post explicitly mentions false rumors of his death.


## Final Judgement
The fact-check reveals that while a Hezbollah drone attack did occur on October 13, 2024, resulting in casualties, reports of IDF Chief Herzi Halevi's death were false rumors.

The claim is demonstrably false because it is directly contradicted by evidence from reliable sources, specifically the Jerusalem Post, which reported on false rumors of Halevi's death. `false`
