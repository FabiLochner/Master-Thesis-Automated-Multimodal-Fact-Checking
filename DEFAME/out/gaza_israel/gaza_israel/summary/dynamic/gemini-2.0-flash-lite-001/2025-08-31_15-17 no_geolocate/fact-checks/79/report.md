Insufficient information is available to verify the claim.


## Final Judgement
The claim states that the image depicts an attack on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024. While there are reports of Hezbollah attacks on the airbase on that date, and the airbase is on Iran's target list, the image itself has not been verified. Reverse image searches and other searches did not yield any results to confirm the image's authenticity. Therefore, the claim cannot be verified. `false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim cannot be verified. While there are reports of Hezbollah attacks on the Ramat David airbase on September 22, 2024, and the airbase is on Iran's target list, the image's authenticity could not be confirmed through reverse image searches or other searches.
