## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Multiple sources report that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from an African Union conference on the Rwandan genocide in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025. The Tasnim News Agency ([https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2025/04/07/3286985/israeli-ambassador-removed-from-african-union-meeting)) and the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)) both published articles on this event.

The Peoples Dispatch ([https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/04/08/israeli-diplomat-booted-from-au-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/04/08/israeli-diplomat-booted-from-au-conference-on-rwandan-genocide/)) also reported on the expulsion. The Anadolu Agency article mentions that Neguise was expelled after member states refused to participate alongside him. ![image 8418](media/2025-08-29_23-53-1756511594-500182.jpg) <image:0> ![image 8426](media/2025-08-29_23-53-1756511625-543194.jpg)


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia, Avraham Neguise, was expelled from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa on April 7, 2025. The Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)) and other sources confirm this.

The expulsion occurred because member states refused to participate alongside him. The event took place during a conference on the Rwandan genocide.

The evidence supports the claim that the ambassador was removed from the conference, but it does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador.


## Final Judgement
The provided evidence confirms that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia was expelled from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa in April 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador. The expulsion was a result of member states refusing to participate alongside him.

`false`

### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
Multiple sources, including the Anadolu Agency ([https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/israeli-ambassador-to-ethiopia-expelled-from-rwanda-genocide-conference/3530926)), report that Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia was expelled from an African Union conference in Addis Ababa in April 2025. However, the evidence does not explicitly state that Ethiopia expelled the ambassador; rather, the expulsion was due to other member states' refusal to participate alongside him.
