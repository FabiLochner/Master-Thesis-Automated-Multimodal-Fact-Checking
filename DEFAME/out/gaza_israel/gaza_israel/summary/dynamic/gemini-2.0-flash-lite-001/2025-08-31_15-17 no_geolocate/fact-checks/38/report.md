## Evidence
### Evidence from `reverse_search`
The image in the claim is of the residence of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was killed in a US drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. The New York Post ([https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/](https://nypost.com/2022/08/01/biden-to-speak-after-us-takes-out-al-qaeda-target-in-afghanistan/)) and News18.com ([https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html](https://www.news18.com/news/world/al-zawahiri-liked-sitting-outside-on-his-balcony-the-cia-watched-for-months-before-killing-him-5671915.html)) both report on the strike.

The strike was carried out with Hellfire missiles, and the house was located in the Sherpur area of Kabul.

## Elaboration
The image in the claim depicts the residence of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was killed in a US drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. The claim incorrectly states that the image shows the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. The evidence also does not support the claim that only Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed.

The evidence indicates that the image is related to the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri, not Ismail Haniyeh. The event occurred in Kabul, Afghanistan, not in a location related to Hamas.

Therefore, the claim is false.


## Final Judgement
The image in the claim shows the aftermath of a US drone strike on the residence of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kabul, Afghanistan, on July 31, 2022. The claim misidentifies the event and the target. `false`
