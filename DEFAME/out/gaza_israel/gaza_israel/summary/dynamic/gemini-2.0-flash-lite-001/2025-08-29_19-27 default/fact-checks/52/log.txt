Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip): 
Content: The Wikipedia article on the Gaza Strip, last updated on January 2025, states that the Gaza Strip has an annual population growth rate of 1.99% (2023 est.). The article also mentions that the Gaza war, which began in 2023, has caused widespread destruction, a humanitarian crisis, and an imminent famine. The article also mentions that over 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the start of the war. <image:i> <image:j> <image:k>

The claim 'The population in Gaza has increased by 2.02% since Oct. 7, 2023.' is false.
Justification: The claim is demonstrably false. While one source initially cited a 2.02% increase, multiple sources, including the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and CNN, report a decrease in Gaza's population since October 7, 2023, due to the ongoing conflict, with the PCBS estimating a 6% decrease ([Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/2025/01/02/palestinian-statistics-bureau-projects-gaza-population-down-by-6-since-start-of-war)).

So, the overall veracity is: false
