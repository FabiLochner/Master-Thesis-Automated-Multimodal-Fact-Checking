Useful result: From [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_2025_Israeli_attacks_on_the_Gaza_Strip): 
Content: The Wikipedia article discusses the March 2025 Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip, which began on March 18, 2025, and ended the 2025 Gaza war ceasefire. The attacks, which included airstrikes and artillery barrages, targeted various locations in the Gaza Strip, including Deir al-Balah. The attacks resulted in numerous casualties. <image:39>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital): 
Content: The Guardian published an article on August 25, 2025, reporting on an Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. <image:6546>. The article mentions a "double tap" strike and includes condemnation from international figures. The article also mentions the Israeli prime minister's regret and a report on war crimes allegations. The article includes several other images. <image:6556>, <image:6558>, <image:6560>, <image:6562>.

The claim '<image:39> This image shows heavy Israeli bombardment on Deir al-Balah in the southern Gaza Strip in March 2025 which killed at least four Palestinians.' is false.
Justification: The claim is partially supported. Evidence from web searches confirms Israeli bombardment in Deir al-Balah in March 2025, as reported by the [UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1160072) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Gaza_Strip_attacks). However, the evidence does not explicitly verify the claim that at least four Palestinians were killed.

So, the overall veracity is: false
