Content: Britannica.com provides an image of the damage caused by the 2025 Myanmar earthquake. <image:5840>

Useful result: From [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/asia/earthquake-myanmar-thailand-death-toll.html): 
Content: The New York Times published an article about the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, including an image of the damage caused by the earthquake <image:5841>.

Useful result: From [Source](https://unu.edu/inweh/collection/building-damage-assessment-march-2025-myanmar-earthquake): 
Content: The search result from the United Nations University (unu.edu) contains an image of building damage caused by the March 2025 Myanmar earthquake <image:5842>.

The claim '<image:2> This image shows the ruins after a 7.9-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025.' is false.
Justification: The claim is unverified. While the existence of a 7.7-7.9 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar on March 28, 2025, is confirmed by multiple sources ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Myanmar_earthquake), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950576325000017), and [https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html](https://phys.org/news/2025-07-myanmar-earthquake-fault-rupture-exceeded.html)), the image search did not return the same image as the one in the claim, making it impossible to verify the image's origin.

So, the overall veracity is: false
