The claim '<image:62> This image shows a man from Gaza holding the hand of his son killed in an Israeli bombing in July, 2024.' is false.
Justification: The image in the claim is of a father in Turkey holding his deceased daughter's hand after an earthquake in February 2023, not a bombing in Gaza in July 2024, as stated in the claim. The photo was taken by Adem Altan and published by multiple news sources, including The Independent ([https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkey-earthquake-father-daughter-hold-hands-b2277655.html)).
