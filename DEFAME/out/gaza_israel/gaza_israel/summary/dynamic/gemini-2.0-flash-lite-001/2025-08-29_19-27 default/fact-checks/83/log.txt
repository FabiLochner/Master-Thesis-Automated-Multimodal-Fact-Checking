Useful result: From [Source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/spanish-fm-swipes-at-barcelona-for-cutting-ties-with-israel/): 
Content: The Times of Israel reports that the president of FC Barcelona invited representatives from Israel’s embassy to Spain to a soccer match in a sign of support for the Jewish state. The Spanish government criticized Barcelona’s mayor for cutting ties with Israel. The article includes a photo of Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares. <image:6692>

The claim '<image:52> This image shows the President of FC Barcelona with Israel Embassy Representatives in September 2024 during the ongoing Gaza war.' is false.
Justification: The image depicts FC Barcelona's president, Joan Laporta, with Israeli Embassy representatives, but the event occurred in February 2023, as reported by the [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-731893) and [i24NEWS](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/diplomacy/1676623454-barcelona-soccer-team-sends-message-of-support-for-israel), not in September 2024. The claim also incorrectly states that the meeting occurred during the ongoing Gaza war.

So, the overall veracity is: false
