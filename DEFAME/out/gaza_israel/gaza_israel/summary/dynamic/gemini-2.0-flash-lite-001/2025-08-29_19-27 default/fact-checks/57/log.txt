The claim '<image:32> This image shows Palestinian baby Sham Imad Muhareb which did not lose her arm in an Israeli airstrike on the Shejaeya neighborhood, east of Gaza City, in April 2025.' is true.
Justification: The image depicts Sham Imad Muhareb, who died in Shuja'iya in April 2025. While there was an Israeli airstrike in the Shejaiya neighborhood in April 2025, the provided evidence, including reports from the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rrnzw0kwo) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2025_Shuja%27iyya_airstrike), does not confirm whether the baby lost her arm in the airstrike. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

So, the overall veracity is: true
