## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/9/poland-says-it-will-protect-benjamin-netanyahu-from-potential-arrest)) reported on January 9, 2025, that Poland will protect Benjamin Netanyahu from potential arrest, referencing an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) ![image 1](media/0.jpg). The Polish government adopted a resolution allowing senior Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, to travel freely to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on January 27, 2025.

The Los Angeles Times ([https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-01-09/polish-president-seeks-protection-for-netanyahu-if-he-attends-auschwitz-anniversary-event)) also reported on January 9, 2025, that the Polish President is seeking protection for Benjamin Netanyahu if he attends the Auschwitz anniversary event <image:k>. DW.COM ([https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468](https://www.dw.com/en/auschwitz-poland-netanyahu-arrest-pledge/a-71377468)) reported on January 22, 2025, that the Polish government guaranteed safe passage to Benjamin Netanyahu, should he attend an event in Poland, also mentioning the ICC arrest warrant <image:k>.


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that in January 2025, Poland was prepared to protect Netanyahu from potential arrest. This suggests that Netanyahu was expected to be in Poland around that time. However, the provided evidence does not mention anything about an Iranian missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, nor does it confirm that Netanyahu fled to Poland on that date.

Therefore, the claim cannot be verified based on the provided evidence. The evidence is missing information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024, and any connection to an Iranian missile attack.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The web sources confirm that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. Al Jazeera ([https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/1/irans-missile-attack-against-israel-what-we-know-and-what-comes-next)) and NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack)) reported on the attack, with Al Jazeera stating it was in response to Israeli actions and NPR noting that Israel intercepted most missiles ![image 1](media/0.jpg), ![image 281](media/2025-07-18_13-37-1752845855-334464.jpg). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_2024_Iranian_strikes_on_Israel)) also discusses the attack, mentioning that Benjamin Netanyahu called it a "big mistake".


## Elaboration
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024. However, the evidence does not confirm whether Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on that date. The provided sources only mention Netanyahu's potential travel to Poland in January 2025.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified due to the lack of information about Netanyahu's whereabouts on October 1, 2024.

### Evidence from `web_search`
The Times of Israel ([https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-meeting-moved-to-secure-underground-location-after-drone-attack-on-pms-home/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-meeting-moved-to-secure-underground-location-after-drone-attack-on-pms-home/)) reported that on October 1, 2024, Iran launched a ballistic missile barrage at Israel. The article also mentions that on October 19, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on Netanyahu's home in Caesarea ![image 6664](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497768-126374.jpg). NPR ([https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel)) reported on October 19, 2024, that a drone targeted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s house in Caesarea, Israel, with no casualties ![image 6655](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497761-170691.jpg), ![image 6651](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497756-793183.jpg), ![image 6654](media/2025-08-29_20-02-1756497760-199376.jpg). The Wikipedia article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_drone_attack_on_Benjamin_Netanyahu%27s_residence)) discusses the drone attack on Netanyahu's residence on October 19, 2024 ![image 1](media/0.jpg).


## Elaboration
The evidence indicates that on October 1, 2024, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel. The Times of Israel reported that on October 19, 2024, Hezbollah launched a drone attack on Netanyahu's home in Caesarea. However, the evidence does not state that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

Therefore, the claim remains unverified.


## Final Judgement
The evidence confirms that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and that Netanyahu's home was targeted by a drone attack on October 19, 2024. However, there is no evidence to support the claim that Netanyahu left Israel and fled to Poland on October 1, 2024.

`false`


### Verdict: FALSE

### Justification
The claim is false. While Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, and Netanyahu's home was targeted by a drone attack later that month, there is no evidence to support the assertion that Netanyahu fled to Poland on October 1, 2024. The provided sources, such as the [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-meeting-moved-to-secure-underground-location-after-drone-attack-on-pms-home/) and [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/19/nx-s1-5158375/netanyahu-house-drone-israel), detail the attacks but do not mention Netanyahu's departure to Poland.
