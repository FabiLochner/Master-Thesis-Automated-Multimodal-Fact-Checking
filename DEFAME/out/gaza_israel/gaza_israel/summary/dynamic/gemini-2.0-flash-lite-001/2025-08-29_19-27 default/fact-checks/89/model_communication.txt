By bne Gulf bureau August 1, 2024

New details over Ismail Haniyeh’s death are now being revealed, with WhatsApp reportedly being singled out as giving away the Palestinian militant group leader's location, _Sputnik_ reported on August 1.

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, [was killed in a blast in Tehran](https://www.intellinews.com/hamas-haniyeh-assassinated-what-happens-next-336350/?source=iran)
 early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC).

Unconfirmed reports suggest that the attack may have been facilitated by spyware installed on Haniyeh's phone through his WhatsApp account, enabling precise location tracking, _Sputnik_ reported citing a European report.

An initial report by Brussels-based journalist Elijah J Mangier reported that “Haniyeh was assassinated following a conversation he had with his son, during which his location was pinpointed,” the long-time journalist of the region did not mention a source for the information.

The spyware in question is believed to be similar to the notorious Pegasus software developed by the Israeli [cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group](https://www.intellinews.com/iranian-foreign-ministry-condemns-haniyeh-s-assassination-in-tehran-336304/?source=iran)
; however, no other source has yet corroborated Mangier’s claims.

Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, has not commented on the issue, but has increasingly stepped up efforts to remove reference to Hamas from its platforms, the latest of which was the removal of a post by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the _Times of Israel_ reported on August 1.

“Let this serve as a clear and unequivocal message to Meta: Cease this display of cowardice,” Anwar posts on his social media page.

Haniyeh, who was visiting Iran for President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration, was reportedly staying at a guesthouse in the Al-Zahra complex in Tehran's Zafaraniyeh district when the attack occurred at approximately 1:45 a.m. Israeli authorities have not responded to requests for comment.

Following Haniyeh’s death, leader of Iran Ali Khamenei has said that the Islamic Republic views it as a duty to take vengeance for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on its soil.

“The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed on it,” said the Supreme Leader in his message.

Israel has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to take out its enemies, with strikes in several countries in Lebanon killing the number two person on Shi’ite group Hezbollah and [Yemen earlier](https://www.intellinews.com/israel-says-it-struck-yemen-s-hodeidah-oil-terminal-334672/?source=iran)
 on July 20.

The attack on the Hodeidah oil terminal saw plumes of smoke and flames, while residents of the city reported large explosions coming from the port area following the Israeli airstrike on the town.

that strike came a day after the unrecognised Yemeni regime struck the country with an Iranian-designed drone close to the US embassy in [central Tel Aviv](https://www.intellinews.com/yemeni-houthis-claim-deadly-drone-attack-on-tel-aviv-334581/?source=iran)
, killing one person and injuring several more.

More than 40,000 people in Gaza have been reportedly killed since Hamas operatives as well as fighters from another group, Islamic Jihad, broke through Israeli defences to attack and kill 1,300 Israelis, Palestinians and other nationalities in a rampage. ](//d39raawggeifpx.cloudfront.net/styles/16_9_400x224/s3/articleimages/Untitled_design_(2).jpg)

Haniyeh, a senior Hamas leader living in exile in Qatar, was killed in a blast in Tehran early July 31 morning, according to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Force Corps (IRGC). Israel has since enacted its so-called Hannibal doctrine.

Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location?
===============================================

![Did WhatsApp give away Hamas leader's location? local time.

Sources claim that despite high-level security measures, including security escorts from Iran's special police unit for VIP protection, a small drone targeted Haniyeh's room with precision.

The attack also resulted in the death of his bodyguard who was part of the following procession.

Iranian security officials had previously warned of potential threats to Haniyeh from Israel.

Visual evidence following Haniyeh’s death indicate the Al-Zahra building on the western side of the former Saadabad royal palace complex had such little damage that the upper floors remained intact, with only localised damage to the floor he was staying on.

Local security sources indicated that unlike initial reports of a strike operated from outside Iran’s borders, the operation was conducted locally within close confines to the palace complex as indicated by the blast radius.

The closest tall building with full view of the Al-Zahra complex is the nearby Senator Palace building."

Need in-depth geopolitical, security, and risk analysis of Eurasian countries and regions? This event, which occurred after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, underscores Tel Aviv’s strategic capacity to neutralise high-value targets linked to Iran-supported militant groups.

Historical context, such as the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus and the subsequent [Tehran’s retaliatory missile and drone strikes](https://www.specialeurasia.com/2024/04/14/iran-attack-israel-report/)
, suggests that **this escalation could provoke a powerful response from Iran**. The broader geopolitical repercussions could influence global investment patterns, with investors potentially seeking safer markets, affecting economic growth in the region.

### Background Information

Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of _Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya_ (Hamas), was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard after a targeted strike [on his residence](https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779)
. This rhetoric implies a possible escalation in retaliatory measures against Israeli targets, both domestically and potentially internationally.

**Ismail Haniyeh’s assassination poses a significant threat to the fragile ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas**. **_Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran; Hamas blames Israel._**
2. Haniyeh was in the city to attend the inauguration of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.

**Hamas and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed the attack, attributing it to Israeli forces**. This incident has further inflamed the already volatile situation, raising fears of a widespread escalation that could engulf multiple countries and lead to severe humanitarian crises.

### Contextual Analysis

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran signifies a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Various international organisations and governments have criticised Haniyeh’s killing, emphasising the need for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.

**The recent Israeli airstrikes in a southern suburb of Beirut, resulting in the targeted killing of Fuad Shukr**, [a senior Hezbollah commander](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1rwxyjydlyo)
, serves to underscore Israel’s proactive stance in neutralising perceived threats from regional adversaries."

Eight hours after the preemptive targeting of senior Hizbullah military leader Fouad Shuker by the Israeli Air Force in the Al-Dahyah neighborhood of Beirut on July 30, Iran officially confirmed that Ismail Haniyeh was killed early in the morning of July 31 in Tehran, along with his bodyguard Wasim Abu Shaaban.

Hamas confirmed his death, blamed Israel, and vowed revenge.

Israel has remained silent, with Prime Minister Netanyahu instructing ministers not to comment publicly.

Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing.

Israeli intelligence sources report that Ismail Haniyeh, based in Qatar, was aware of the planned attacks by Hamas on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7.

Accounts from Tehran state that Haniyeh and his bodyguard were killed in their apartment at a guest house for foreign leaders.

The preemptive targeting was possibly by a submarine-launched missile from a distance at the bedroom where Haniyeh was staying.

This event is a double blow to both Hamas and Iran.

Haniyeh played a crucial role in managing Hamas’s political strategies, building connections throughout the Muslim world, and securing donations to fund its terror activities.

The Preemptive Targeting of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran
====================================================

A Double Blow to Hamas and Iran

Iranian Supreme Leader Khamenei’s declaration on July 31, 2024.

#### Table of Contents

Iran announced the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh during his visit to Tehran, where he attended the inauguration ceremony of Iran’s new president, Masoud Pazashekian.

This event is significant both operationally and morale-wise. Musa Abu Marzouk, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, condemned the assassination, calling it “a cowardly act that will not go unpunished.”

The movement will elect a new leader to replace Haniyeh.

This is another severe blow to Hamas’s morale and operations following the killing of Muhammad Deif, the supreme commander of Hamas’s military wing in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, a rival of Haniyeh, is likely to benefit from this development, as he commands Hamas in Gaza and holds a crucial bargaining chip – Israeli hostages.

Hamas asserts that Haniyeh’s killing is part of an Israeli effort to pressure its leadership regarding the hostages and maintains that this will not alter its stance.

The death of Ismail Haniyeh will not end the conflict in the Gaza Strip as long as Yahya Sinwar and other members of Hamas’s military leadership remain alive.

He was a key figure in Hamas’s alignment with Shiite Iran, as opposed to Khaled Mashaal, who favors closer ties with the Sunni “Muslim Brotherhood” axis, including Qatar, Turkey, and Pakistan.

Iran faces criticism for failing to adequately protect Haniyeh on its soil, marking a significant security lapse.

This incident adds to other security failures in Iran, such as the assassination of Fakhri Mohsen Zadeh, the so-called father of Iran’s nuclear program, by the Israeli Mossad in November 2020.

Haniyeh’s decision to leave Doha, Qatar, and attend the Iranian president’s inauguration in Tehran proved fatal, providing an opportunity for Mossad to target him.

Before his death, Haniyeh met with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Islamic Jihad leader Ziad Nachala.

It is believed that the Israeli Mossad avoided targeting Haniyeh in Qatar for two reasons: Qatar’s role as a mediator in the Israeli hostages’ negotiations and operational considerations.

Hamas claims that Haniyeh’s death will not alter its campaign against Israel, which has previously seen the elimination of key leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas. (res.) Maurice Hirsch](https://jcpa.org/researcher/maurice-hirsch/)

([https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/](https://jcpa.org/the-preemptive-targeting-of-ismail-haniyeh-in-tehran/)) <image:6741>, <image:6740>, <image:6744>, <image:6745>, <image:6746>, <image:6749>, <image:6750>, <image:6751>


## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

Enduring the otherwise conspicuous silence of his smartphone’s screen, the primitive WhatsApp message to Ismail Haniyeh was innocently insidious. It is here that the propensity of using AI for spyware is highly dangerous with situation from surveillance of people to assassination becoming more probable.

In this regards, the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh is not an exceptional case but the upcoming nature of war. The cold-blooded execution of Ismail Haniyeh evidences these methods as being highly successful, and how state actors pay careful detailing to the utilization of advanced technology that gets rid of such threats in a most efficient manner.

He said the implications of this episode are not limited to the political and military planes at the moment. Magnier claimed that while Haniyeh spoke to his son not aware of the fact that the communication was being intercepted by wire tappers, Israeli agents were identifying his exact where about. In a few minutes, the information was passed through, and a specific attack was made, putting a stop to Haniyeh for good. The above attack on Haniyeh goes a long way in showing that the advanced technology qualifier, can be used in almost any operation, from counter terrorism to even suppression of political opposition. It brings about many ethical issues concerning the use of such effective surveillance equipments such as; who to blame in the case of misuse?

This is the asymmetric characteristic of today’s warfare that can be illustrated by the penetration and subsequent elimination of Haniyeh. The analysis of spyware-driven murder of Haniyeh shows that there are significant gaps which must be filled; while the fight for security should continue, it must not occur at the expense of liberty.

Regarding the broader significance of this affair, the further evolution of the technological war presents itself as a burning question."

# Your Analysis



===== > RESPONSE:  < =====
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.

## Elaboration
The evidence suggests that Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran on July 31, 2024. One source mentions unconfirmed reports of location tracking via spyware, possibly through WhatsApp, but this is not confirmed.

Therefore, the claim that Israeli intelligence tracked Haniyeh through WhatsApp is unconfirmed.

The evidence does not provide enough information to verify the claim.

## Evidence
### Evidence from `web_search`
The Jerusalem Post reported on June 17, 2025, that Iranian state media warned that Israel uses cell phone tracking to assassinate leaders in Iran, mentioning the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. ([https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/defense-news/article-858067)) <image:k> Modern Diplomacy, on August 4, 2024, discussed the assassination of Haniyeh and the potential use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, suggesting that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

## Elaboration
The new evidence reinforces the claim that Haniyeh was assassinated in Tehran. It also provides additional context regarding the methods potentially used by Israeli intelligence.

Specifically, the Jerusalem Post indicates that Iranian state media warned about Israel's use of cell phone tracking for assassinations, referencing Haniyeh's killing. Modern Diplomacy suggests the use of spyware, including AI, for surveillance and assassination, implying that Israeli agents may have identified Haniyeh's location through intercepted communications.

While the evidence does not explicitly confirm WhatsApp was used, it supports the possibility of cell phone tracking and intercepted communications, which aligns with the claim. However, the exact method remains unconfirmed.

Unlike many celebrities, **Johnson** does not appear to be showing a clear allegiance with either side of the conflict, although, whilst mentioning the loss of Palestinian lives, he does not specifically mention the Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

The airstrikes were launched in response to a sudden surprise attack from Hamas on Israeli towns near the border and a music festival in the desert where hundreds of young people were killed and many kidnapped.

Hollywood stars are showing their support for Israel, after Hamas launched a surprise attack this past weekend, firing thousands of rockets from Gaza that have killed at least 900 people with more than 100 civilians kidnapped and held hostage.

Over the weekend, President Joe Biden condemned the terrorist attack and supported Israel’s right to defend itself. “The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

Israel ordered a “complete siege” of Gaza on Monday, cutting off all electricity, food and water to the area. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed by Israel airstrikes, in response to the Hamas attack.

Now, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are speaking up to lend their support to Israel. What a horrific day.”

Selma Blair, who is Jewish, commented on social media to offer her unwavering support to Israel and Jews around the world. I stand with Israel.”
